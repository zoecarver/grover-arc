=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 09:26:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:39:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, fills, or object parts in a 2D scene), where the goal is to process each row independently to clean up invalid patterns, fill logical gaps in "objects" defined by repeated numbers (like 3s or 5s), and handle runs of 1s (possibly connectors or fillers) based on adjacency and gap rules, ultimately producing a corrected grid that matches expected visual structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Numbers like 3, 5, 9 represent distinct "object" types or colors (e.g., 3 might be one shape, 5 another, 9 a temporary marker or boundary); 1s act as fillers or extensions that can be placed in 0-gaps but must be removed if misplaced near conflicting elements like 9s.
 * Process rows sequentially with passes: first remove invalid 1s in sequences mixing 9s and 1s (to avoid "misplaced" fillers near boundaries); then fill specific gap patterns between matching non-1/0/9 numbers (e.g., single or double 0-gaps between Cs, but only under limited conditions like adjacent to a 1); finally, validate and extend/shorten runs of 1s to the left based on gap length (l <=3 zeros allows filling with 1s, longer gaps remove the run entirely).
 * Subtlety: Gap filling is highly pattern-specific (e.g., for k=1: C-0-C fills to C-1-C; for k=2: C-0-0-C-1 fills first two 0s to 1s, but skips if not exactly matching); this misses broader propagation or vertical alignment considerations across rows.
 * 1-runs only extend leftward into 0-gaps if bounded by a non-0 and gap <=3; otherwise, delete the run—easy to miss that left-bound check (non-0 neighbor) prevents unbounded extension.
 * No vertical processing: rules are strictly per-row, but visual correctness implies row outputs should align to form coherent objects (e.g., columns of 3s building a shape).
 * 0s are empty space; avoid over-filling or creating new objects; 9s seem to block or mark invalid fills.
 * All considerations from attempts: Avoid global changes (row-only); handle runs starting at row edges carefully; don't fill gaps without exact matches (prevents overreach); track run boundaries precisely to avoid infinite loops in while loops.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: All functions applied properly, correctly removed/filled to match expected (likely simple patterns with no conflicts).
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated row 6 [0,0,3,0,0,3,5,1,1,5] vs expected [0,0,3,1,1,3,5,1,1,5]—missing 1s in positions 3-4 (under-filled gap between 3s); row 7-8 match; row 9 [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] vs expected [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] (minor leading difference, possibly from propagation error).
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex 9s and 1s without misremoval, suggesting remove_misplaced_ones and process_one_runs work for boundary-heavy cases.
 * Overall: remove_misplaced_ones is helpful and correct (no issues noted); fill_gaps is broken for gaps >1 without trailing 1 (causes under-fill in train 2); process_one_runs over-removes 1-runs when left gap >3 or unbounded (likely cause of train 2 row 6 error, as it deleted valid short-gap 1s).
 * No extract_objects function attempted—puzzle doesn't seem to need object extraction (row-wise only), so not relevant (don't use in future).
 * Subtle miss: fill_gaps skips if C is 9 or 1, but doesn't propagate fills across multiple gaps; process_one_runs only handles left extensions, ignoring right or vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows heavy 0-filling (e.g., row 1: [9,9,0,...] becomes all 0s except leading 9s? Wait, output row1 [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—partial, but 9s persist); row 4 has 9s partially cleared to 0s but trailing 5 intact; row 6 has 5-1-5 with leading 0s; row 10 [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,1,5] retains 1 near end.
 * Does not look correct: Expected likely involves filling 0-gaps between 3s/5s with 1s (e.g., row 7 has leading 3 then 0s—should fill to connect to lower 3s?); 9s in rows 1-5 should be cleared or converted entirely (generated leaves some 9s, but train 2 suggests 9s block 1s); row 6 [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] under-filled (1 only between 5s, but leading 0s near 3 in row7 suggest vertical alignment for object completion); mismatches visual coherence (e.g., diagonal 9s in input should form/clear a shape, but output scatters 1s without connecting 3-5 objects).
 * Unknown why row 10 keeps isolated 1 (process_one_runs should remove if left-gap >3, but input has 3s before 5s—possible over-retention); overall, test under-fills connections (e.g., no 1s bridging 3s to 5s across rows) and leaves invalid 9s, indicating fill_gaps too restrictive for test's multi-gap patterns.

[2025-10-03 09:39:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:48:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving iterative row-wise operations to remove invalid sequences of 1's (likely representing a special filler or connector) and fill valid gaps with 1's, based on adjacency to other numbers, edges, and length constraints, simulating a matching or stabilization mechanic across 10x10 grids with various integer values representing colors or types.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Removal targets contiguous sequences of 1's: short ones (≤3) fully bounded by 0's or edges are removed; asymmetric cases allow removal if bounded on one side by a non-1/non-edge (but not 0/1/edge) and the other by 0, with length ≤2.
 * Filling targets contiguous gaps of 0's: only if length ≤3, not touching edges, and bounded by non-0's where at least one side is 1 or both sides match in value (non-1), but skips if any bound is 0.
 * Operations are applied sequentially: all removals across rows first, then all fillings, without iteration between them or column-wise effects, which may miss cascading changes.
 * 1's act as fillers but are not treated as "objects" like other numbers (2-9); they are transient and removed under isolation conditions, but can propagate filling if adjacent to gaps.
 * Subtle edge cases: 'edge' as a boundary type in removal (treated like 0 for isolation); fillings require both bounds non-0 but allow propagation from 1's; no vertical interactions, so rows are independent.
 * Grids use 0 for empty, 1 for filler, and 2-9 for stable objects; over-filling can occur if rules don't check for prior 1's or conflicting adjacencies.
 * Potential misses: removals don't handle sequences adjacent to same-number groups; fillings may incorrectly trigger near dissimilar numbers if one is 1; no handling for longer gaps (>3) or edge-touching gaps.
 * All considerations: row independence; no diagonal or multi-row effects; preserve non-1 numbers; output a modified copy of input grid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating core row-wise isolation removal and gap filling for simple cases).
 * Failed on training example 3: generated extra 1's in row 3 (positions 4-6: 1,1,1 instead of 0,0,0) and row 4 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 0,0), while correctly removing/handling other parts like row 5's 9's; this suggests over-aggressive filling triggered by adjacent 9's and 1-propagation without checking for invalid contexts post-removal.
 * Removal logic worked for isolating 1's in training 3 (e.g., cleared some but not the problematic ones), but filling didn't: it filled gaps between 9's and existing 1's/9's where expected output left them as 0's, possibly because the condition "(left_c == right_c and left_c != 1) or left_c == 1 or right_c == 1" is too broad and allows filling near dissimilar stable numbers if a 1 is involved.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., groups of same numbers) were used or needed; the approach is purely sequence-scanning per row, which is helpful but misses potential group symmetries.
 * The asymmetric removal clause (non-1 left, 0 right, ≤2) may be untested or incorrect for training 3, as it didn't trigger needed removals.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of scanning for 1-sequences and 0-gaps but lacks refinement for when fillings should be blocked (e.g., between different non-1 numbers without exact match).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows removals and fillings, e.g., row 3 has [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] (extending 9's rightward, but input has [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? Wait, test input not fully shown, but assuming from pattern); however, mentally applying rules: if input has isolated 1's or gaps near 9's/5's, fillings like row 4's [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5] suggest merging 9's across a gap, but expected might not allow if bounds don't match (9 left, 0/5 right? unclear without full input).
 * Does not look fully correct: row 6 has [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5] (filling a 1 between 5's?), but if rules require symmetric non-1 bounds, this might be invalid if post-removal gap is >3 or edge-adjacent; row 8/9 show 3's and 5's extended, but expected could leave gaps if one bound is 1-propagated incorrectly, similar to training 3 error.
 * Row 9 [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5] retains a 1 near 5's, which might not be removed if not isolated (≤3 bounded by 0/edge), but could be over-filled; overall, outputs propagate numbers/1's more than expected in training 3, suggesting same filling bug persists—e.g., 1 in row 6/8/9 looks suspicious and likely incorrect if rules block 1-fills between mismatched groups like 3 and 5.
 * To handle test: need stricter filling (e.g., require exact bound match without 1-propagation unless isolated); test exposes issues with multi-number rows (3,5 interactions) not seen in training 1/2.

[2025-10-03 09:48:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, fills, or object parts in a 2D scene), where the goal is to process each row independently to clean up invalid patterns, fill logical gaps in "objects" defined by repeated numbers (like 3s or 5s), and handle runs of 1s (possibly connectors or fillers) based on adjacency and gap rules, ultimately producing a corrected grid that matches expected visual structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Numbers like 3, 5, 9 represent distinct "object" types or colors (e.g., 3 might be one shape, 5 another, 9 a temporary marker or boundary); 1s act as fillers or extensions that can be placed in 0-gaps but must be removed if misplaced near conflicting elements like 9s.
 * Process rows sequentially with passes: first remove invalid 1s in sequences mixing 9s and 1s (to avoid "misplaced" fillers near boundaries); then fill specific gap patterns between matching non-1/0/9 numbers (e.g., single or double 0-gaps between Cs, but only under limited conditions like adjacent to a 1); finally, validate and extend/shorten runs of 1s to the left based on gap length (l <=3 zeros allows filling with 1s, longer gaps remove the run entirely).
 * Subtlety: Gap filling is highly pattern-specific (e.g., for k=1: C-0-C fills to C-1-C; for k=2: C-0-0-C-1 fills first two 0s to 1s, but skips if not exactly matching); this misses broader propagation or vertical alignment considerations across rows.
 * 1-runs only extend leftward into 0-gaps if bounded by a non-0 and gap <=3; otherwise, delete the run—easy to miss that left-bound check (non-0 neighbor) prevents unbounded extension.
 * No vertical processing: rules are strictly per-row, but visual correctness implies row outputs should align to form coherent objects (e.g., columns of 3s building a shape).
 * 0s are empty space; avoid over-filling or creating new objects; 9s seem to block or mark invalid fills.
 * All considerations from attempts: Avoid global changes (row-only); handle runs starting at row edges carefully; don't fill gaps without exact matches (prevents overreach); track run boundaries precisely to avoid infinite loops in while loops.

        i = run_right + 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: All functions applied properly, correctly removed/filled to match expected (likely simple patterns with no conflicts).
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated row 6 [0,0,3,0,0,3,5,1,1,5] vs expected [0,0,3,1,1,3,5,1,1,5]—missing 1s in positions 3-4 (under-filled gap between 3s); row 7-8 match; row 9 [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] vs expected [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] (minor leading difference, possibly from propagation error).
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex 9s and 1s without misremoval, suggesting remove_misplaced_ones and process_one_runs work for boundary-heavy cases.
 * Overall: remove_misplaced_ones is helpful and correct (no issues noted); fill_gaps is broken for gaps >1 without trailing 1 (causes under-fill in train 2); process_one_runs over-removes 1-runs when left gap >3 or unbounded (likely cause of train 2 row 6 error, as it deleted valid short-gap 1s).
 * No extract_objects function attempted—puzzle doesn't seem to need object extraction (row-wise only), so not relevant (don't use in future).
 * Subtle miss: fill_gaps skips if C is 9 or 1, but doesn't propagate fills across multiple gaps; process_one_runs only handles left extensions, ignoring right or vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows heavy 0-filling (e.g., row 1: [9,9,0,...] becomes all 0s except leading 9s? Wait, output row1 [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—partial, but 9s persist); row 4 has 9s partially cleared to 0s but trailing 5 intact; row 6 has 5-1-5 with leading 0s; row 10 [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,1,5] retains 1 near end.
 * Does not look correct: Expected likely involves filling 0-gaps between 3s/5s with 1s (e.g., row 7 has leading 3 then 0s—should fill to connect to lower 3s?); 9s in rows 1-5 should be cleared or converted entirely (generated leaves some 9s, but train 2 suggests 9s block 1s); row 6 [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] under-filled (1 only between 5s, but leading 0s near 3 in row7 suggest vertical alignment for object completion); mismatches visual coherence (e.g., diagonal 9s in input should form/clear a shape, but output scatters 1s without connecting 3-5 objects).
 * Unknown why row 10 keeps isolated 1 (process_one_runs should remove if left-gap >3, but input has 3s before 5s—possible over-retention); overall, test under-fills connections (e.g., no 1s bridging 3s to 5s across rows) and leaves invalid 9s, indicating fill_gaps too restrictive for test's multi-gap patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving iterative row-wise operations to remove invalid sequences of 1's (likely representing a special filler or connector) and fill valid gaps with 1's, based on adjacency to other numbers, edges, and length constraints, simulating a matching or stabilization mechanic across 10x10 grids with various integer values representing colors or types.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Removal targets contiguous sequences of 1's: short ones (≤3) fully bounded by 0's or edges are removed; asymmetric cases allow removal if bounded on one side by a non-1/non-edge (but not 0/1/edge) and the other by 0, with length ≤2.
 * Filling targets contiguous gaps of 0's: only if length ≤3, not touching edges, and bounded by non-0's where at least one side is 1 or both sides match in value (non-1), but skips if any bound is 0.
 * Operations are applied sequentially: all removals across rows first, then all fillings, without iteration between them or column-wise effects, which may miss cascading changes.
 * 1's act as fillers but are not treated as "objects" like other numbers (2-9); they are transient and removed under isolation conditions, but can propagate filling if adjacent to gaps.
 * Subtle edge cases: 'edge' as a boundary type in removal (treated like 0 for isolation); fillings require both bounds non-0 but allow propagation from 1's; no vertical interactions, so rows are independent.
 * Grids use 0 for empty, 1 for filler, and 2-9 for stable objects; over-filling can occur if rules don't check for prior 1's or conflicting adjacencies.
 * Potential misses: removals don't handle sequences adjacent to same-number groups; fillings may incorrectly trigger near dissimilar numbers if one is 1; no handling for longer gaps (>3) or edge-touching gaps.
 * All considerations: row independence; no diagonal or multi-row effects; preserve non-1 numbers; output a modified copy of input grid.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 09:56:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a row-wise grid processing puzzle involving symbol-based pattern recognition and manipulation, where the goal is to clean invalid 1s (fillers or paths) near certain boundaries (like 9s), fill short gaps between matching non-boundary symbols with 1s, and validate or extend isolated 1-runs based on proximity to existing structures, likely to form connected regions or paths in a visual diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 9s appear to act as boundaries or invalidators for 1s; sequences containing both 9 and 1 should have 1s zeroed out to prevent invalid "misplaced" fillers.
 * Filling only applies to small, specific gaps (e.g., 1 or 2 zeros) between identical non-0/1/9 symbols (denoted as C), replacing them strictly with 1s (e.g., C-0-C becomes C-1-C); longer gaps or mismatched symbols are ignored, which can lead to under-filling in complex or extended patterns.
 * Isolated 1-runs (not adjacent to other 1s) are validated leftward: if a non-zero symbol is within 3 zeros to the left, fill the gap with 1s to connect; otherwise, remove the run entirely—subtleties include accurate gap counting (from run start leftward, stopping at first non-zero or boundary) and avoiding over-removal near edges.
 * Processing order matters: clean misplaced 1s first, then fill gaps, then validate runs, applied independently per row without column-wise interactions.
 * 1s represent temporary or connective fillers, but only persist if they form valid short connections; other numbers (e.g., 3,5) are structural and not altered except via filling between matches.
 * Easy-to-miss: No filling across different symbols (e.g., no 1s between 9 and 5); runs must be truly isolated (no left-adjacent 1); boundary hits (e.g., left edge) may invalidate runs if no connector found; no vertical processing, so rows are independent.
 * General considerations: Grid is 10x10; inputs have clustered symbols (e.g., diagonal/shifting 9s, bottom-right 5s, bottom-left 3s); output should preserve original non-0/1/9 symbols while minimally adding/removing 1s to "complete" patterns without overgeneralizing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed all three training examples, indicating good handling of basic cases for cleaning 1s near 9s, short gap filling between matching symbols, and run validation in simpler row patterns.
 * What worked: remove_misplaced_ones correctly zeros invalid 1s in mixed 9-1 sequences (key for boundary cleaning in training 1 and 3); fill_gaps handles k=1/2 gaps rigidly but accurately for direct matches (effective in training 2); process_one_runs validates short left connections without over-removal in most training cases.
 * What didn't work: process_one_runs has a bug in gap counting (starts from run_left-1 but may miscount if adjacent non-zero is misinterpreted, leading to potential boundary issues noted in training 2 comments); fill_gaps is too limited (only k=1/2, skips longer or non-exact matches, causing under-filling in rows with extended 0s); overall program under-processes complex shifts or non-short connections, as seen in minimal changes to test.
 * No prior attempts detailed, but comments in functions highlight partial successes (e.g., 1/3 training good for cleaning, but misses persistence in 2) and rigidity issues; no extraction functions used, but row-scanning approach is core and helpful for independent row processing.
 * Function remove_misplaced_ones is helpful and mostly correct (retain for future); fill_gaps is partially helpful but needs extension for longer gaps (improve, don't discard); process_one_runs is useful for validation but broken on edge cases/boundary hits (fix gap logic before reuse); no unhelpful functions noted, but rigid gap limits suggest avoiding without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal changes from what appears to be the input (e.g., isolated 1s persist in rows 5,7,8,9 at column 8, likely from existing or small fills like 5-1-5), but large 0-regions remain unfilled (e.g., row 6: single 3 followed by many 0s to distant 5; row 4: 9s separated from 5 by 0s), suggesting no action on longer gaps or mismatched symbols.
 * It does not look fully correct, as the output seems under-processed: expected more 1-filling or connections in shifting patterns (e.g., diagonal 9s to 5s might imply short row-wise links, but none added beyond existing 1s; bottom 3-5 transitions in rows 7-9 have 1s only at end, not bridging main gaps like row 9's abrupt 3-to-5 shift without 1s).
 * Specific differences: Row 0 all 0s (expected, no symbols); rows 1-2 have partial 9-clusters with trailing 0s (no fills, correct if no matches); row 3 has 9,9,9 then 0s to 5 (no 1s added, but might expect short fill if rules allow near-boundary); rows 6 has isolated 3 and 5 (no connection, likely correct per short-gap limit but feels incomplete for visual puzzle); 1s in later rows (e.g., row 5 col8) match small 5-1-5, which worked, but overall grid lacks cohesive paths, differing from expected "completed" structure.
 * The output makes partial sense for rigid short-gap rules (preserves structures, adds minimal 1s where possible), but does not fully resolve the test's complex layout (e.g., no handling for potential left-run extensions across >2 0s or 9-5 boundaries), indicating the program is too conservative and misses subtle connection opportunities.

[2025-10-03 09:56:09] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, fills, or object parts in a 2D scene), where the goal is to process each row independently to clean up invalid patterns, fill logical gaps in "objects" defined by repeated numbers (like 3s or 5s), and handle runs of 1s (possibly connectors or fillers) based on adjacency and gap rules, ultimately producing a corrected grid that matches expected visual structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Numbers like 3, 5, 9 represent distinct "object" types or colors (e.g., 3 might be one shape, 5 another, 9 a temporary marker or boundary); 1s act as fillers or extensions that can be placed in 0-gaps but must be removed if misplaced near conflicting elements like 9s.
 * Process rows sequentially with passes: first remove invalid 1s in sequences mixing 9s and 1s (to avoid "misplaced" fillers near boundaries); then fill specific gap patterns between matching non-1/0/9 numbers (e.g., single or double 0-gaps between Cs, but only under limited conditions like adjacent to a 1); finally, validate and extend/shorten runs of 1s to the left based on gap length (l <=3 zeros allows filling with 1s, longer gaps remove the run entirely).
 * Subtlety: Gap filling is highly pattern-specific (e.g., for k=1: C-0-C fills to C-1-C; for k=2: C-0-0-C-1 fills first two 0s to 1s, but skips if not exactly matching); this misses broader propagation or vertical alignment considerations across rows.
 * 1-runs only extend leftward into 0-gaps if bounded by a non-0 and gap <=3; otherwise, delete the run—easy to miss that left-bound check (non-0 neighbor) prevents unbounded extension.
 * No vertical processing: rules are strictly per-row, but visual correctness implies row outputs should align to form coherent objects (e.g., columns of 3s building a shape).
 * 0s are empty space; avoid over-filling or creating new objects; 9s seem to block or mark invalid fills.
 * All considerations from attempts: Avoid global changes (row-only); handle runs starting at row edges carefully; don't fill gaps without exact matches (prevents overreach); track run boundaries precisely to avoid infinite loops in while loops.

 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated row 6 [0,0,3,0,0,3,5,1,1,5] vs expected [0,0,3,1,1,3,5,1,1,5]—missing 1s in positions 3-4 (under-filled gap between 3s); row 7-8 match; row 9 [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] vs expected [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] (minor leading difference, possibly from propagation error).
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex 9s and 1s without misremoval, suggesting remove_misplaced_ones and process_one_runs work for boundary-heavy cases.
 * Overall: remove_misplaced_ones is helpful and correct (no issues noted); fill_gaps is broken for gaps >1 without trailing 1 (causes under-fill in train 2); process_one_runs over-removes 1-runs when left gap >3 or unbounded (likely cause of train 2 row 6 error, as it deleted valid short-gap 1s).
 * No extract_objects function attempted—puzzle doesn't seem to need object extraction (row-wise only), so not relevant (don't use in future).
 * Subtle miss: fill_gaps skips if C is 9 or 1, but doesn't propagate fills across multiple gaps; process_one_runs only handles left extensions, ignoring right or vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows heavy 0-filling (e.g., row 1: [9,9,0,...] becomes all 0s except leading 9s? Wait, output row1 [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—partial, but 9s persist); row 4 has 9s partially cleared to 0s but trailing 5 intact; row 6 has 5-1-5 with leading 0s; row 10 [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,1,5] retains 1 near end.
 * Does not look correct: Expected likely involves filling 0-gaps between 3s/5s with 1s (e.g., row 7 has leading 3 then 0s—should fill to connect to lower 3s?); 9s in rows 1-5 should be cleared or converted entirely (generated leaves some 9s, but train 2 suggests 9s block 1s); row 6 [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] under-filled (1 only between 5s, but leading 0s near 3 in row7 suggest vertical alignment for object completion); mismatches visual coherence (e.g., diagonal 9s in input should form/clear a shape, but output scatters 1s without connecting 3-5 objects).
 * Unknown why row 10 keeps isolated 1 (process_one_runs should remove if left-gap >3, but input has 3s before 5s—possible over-retention); overall, test under-fills connections (e.g., no 1s bridging 3s to 5s across rows) and leaves invalid 9s, indicating fill_gaps too restrictive for test's multi-gap patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving iterative row-wise operations to remove invalid sequences of 1's (likely representing a special filler or connector) and fill valid gaps with 1's, based on adjacency to other numbers, edges, and length constraints, simulating a matching or stabilization mechanic across 10x10 grids with various integer values representing colors or types.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Removal targets contiguous sequences of 1's: short ones (≤3) fully bounded by 0's or edges are removed; asymmetric cases allow removal if bounded on one side by a non-1/non-edge (but not 0/1/edge) and the other by 0, with length ≤2.
 * Filling targets contiguous gaps of 0's: only if length ≤3, not touching edges, and bounded by non-0's where at least one side is 1 or both sides match in value (non-1), but skips if any bound is 0.
 * Operations are applied sequentially: all removals across rows first, then all fillings, without iteration between them or column-wise effects, which may miss cascading changes.
 * 1's act as fillers but are not treated as "objects" like other numbers (2-9); they are transient and removed under isolation conditions, but can propagate filling if adjacent to gaps.
 * Subtle edge cases: 'edge' as a boundary type in removal (treated like 0 for isolation); fillings require both bounds non-0 but allow propagation from 1's; no vertical interactions, so rows are independent.
 * Grids use 0 for empty, 1 for filler, and 2-9 for stable objects; over-filling can occur if rules don't check for prior 1's or conflicting adjacencies.
 * Potential misses: removals don't handle sequences adjacent to same-number groups; fillings may incorrectly trigger near dissimilar numbers if one is 1; no handling for longer gaps (>3) or edge-touching gaps.
 * All considerations: row independence; no diagonal or multi-row effects; preserve non-1 numbers; output a modified copy of input grid.

    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating core row-wise isolation removal and gap filling for simple cases).
 * Failed on training example 3: generated extra 1's in row 3 (positions 4-6: 1,1,1 instead of 0,0,0) and row 4 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 0,0), while correctly removing/handling other parts like row 5's 9's; this suggests over-aggressive filling triggered by adjacent 9's and 1-propagation without checking for invalid contexts post-removal.
 * Removal logic worked for isolating 1's in training 3 (e.g., cleared some but not the problematic ones), but filling didn't: it filled gaps between 9's and existing 1's/9's where expected output left them as 0's, possibly because the condition "(left_c == right_c and left_c != 1) or left_c == 1 or right_c == 1" is too broad and allows filling near dissimilar stable numbers if a 1 is involved.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., groups of same numbers) were used or needed; the approach is purely sequence-scanning per row, which is helpful but misses potential group symmetries.
 * The asymmetric removal clause (non-1 left, 0 right, ≤2) may be untested or incorrect for training 3, as it didn't trigger needed removals.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of scanning for 1-sequences and 0-gaps but lacks refinement for when fillings should be blocked (e.g., between different non-1 numbers without exact match).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows removals and fillings, e.g., row 3 has [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] (extending 9's rightward, but input has [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? Wait, test input not fully shown, but assuming from pattern); however, mentally applying rules: if input has isolated 1's or gaps near 9's/5's, fillings like row 4's [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5] suggest merging 9's across a gap, but expected might not allow if bounds don't match (9 left, 0/5 right? unclear without full input).
 * Does not look fully correct: row 6 has [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5] (filling a 1 between 5's?), but if rules require symmetric non-1 bounds, this might be invalid if post-removal gap is >3 or edge-adjacent; row 8/9 show 3's and 5's extended, but expected could leave gaps if one bound is 1-propagated incorrectly, similar to training 3 error.
 * Row 9 [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5] retains a 1 near 5's, which might not be removed if not isolated (≤3 bounded by 0/edge), but could be over-filled; overall, outputs propagate numbers/1's more than expected in training 3, suggesting same filling bug persists—e.g., 1 in row 6/8/9 looks suspicious and likely incorrect if rules block 1-fills between mismatched groups like 3 and 5.
 * To handle test: need stricter filling (e.g., require exact bound match without 1-propagation unless isolated); test exposes issues with multi-number rows (3,5 interactions) not seen in training 1/2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a row-wise grid processing puzzle involving symbol-based pattern recognition and manipulation, where the goal is to clean invalid 1s (fillers or paths) near certain boundaries (like 9s), fill short gaps between matching non-boundary symbols with 1s, and validate or extend isolated 1-runs based on proximity to existing structures, likely to form connected regions or paths in a visual diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 9s appear to act as boundaries or invalidators for 1s; sequences containing both 9 and 1 should have 1s zeroed out to prevent invalid "misplaced" fillers.
 * Filling only applies to small, specific gaps (e.g., 1 or 2 zeros) between identical non-0/1/9 symbols (denoted as C), replacing them strictly with 1s (e.g., C-0-C becomes C-1-C); longer gaps or mismatched symbols are ignored, which can lead to under-filling in complex or extended patterns.
 * Isolated 1-runs (not adjacent to other 1s) are validated leftward: if a non-zero symbol is within 3 zeros to the left, fill the gap with 1s to connect; otherwise, remove the run entirely—subtleties include accurate gap counting (from run start leftward, stopping at first non-zero or boundary) and avoiding over-removal near edges.
 * Processing order matters: clean misplaced 1s first, then fill gaps, then validate runs, applied independently per row without column-wise interactions.
 * 1s represent temporary or connective fillers, but only persist if they form valid short connections; other numbers (e.g., 3,5) are structural and not altered except via filling between matches.
 * Easy-to-miss: No filling across different symbols (e.g., no 1s between 9 and 5); runs must be truly isolated (no left-adjacent 1); boundary hits (e.g., left edge) may invalidate runs if no connector found; no vertical processing, so rows are independent.
 * General considerations: Grid is 10x10; inputs have clustered symbols (e.g., diagonal/shifting 9s, bottom-right 5s, bottom-left 3s); output should preserve original non-0/1/9 symbols while minimally adding/removing 1s to "complete" patterns without overgeneralizing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed all three training examples, indicating good handling of basic cases for cleaning 1s near 9s, short gap filling between matching symbols, and run validation in simpler row patterns.
 * What worked: remove_misplaced_ones correctly zeros invalid 1s in mixed 9-1 sequences (key for boundary cleaning in training 1 and 3); fill_gaps handles k=1/2 gaps rigidly but accurately for direct matches (effective in training 2); process_one_runs validates short left connections without over-removal in most training cases.
 * What didn't work: process_one_runs has a bug in gap counting (starts from run_left-1 but may miscount if adjacent non-zero is misinterpreted, leading to potential boundary issues noted in training 2 comments); fill_gaps is too limited (only k=1/2, skips longer or non-exact matches, causing under-filling in rows with extended 0s); overall program under-processes complex shifts or non-short connections, as seen in minimal changes to test.
 * No prior attempts detailed, but comments in functions highlight partial successes (e.g., 1/3 training good for cleaning, but misses persistence in 2) and rigidity issues; no extraction functions used, but row-scanning approach is core and helpful for independent row processing.
 * Function remove_misplaced_ones is helpful and mostly correct (retain for future); fill_gaps is partially helpful but needs extension for longer gaps (improve, don't discard); process_one_runs is useful for validation but broken on edge cases/boundary hits (fix gap logic before reuse); no unhelpful functions noted, but rigid gap limits suggest avoiding without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal changes from what appears to be the input (e.g., isolated 1s persist in rows 5,7,8,9 at column 8, likely from existing or small fills like 5-1-5), but large 0-regions remain unfilled (e.g., row 6: single 3 followed by many 0s to distant 5; row 4: 9s separated from 5 by 0s), suggesting no action on longer gaps or mismatched symbols.
 * It does not look fully correct, as the output seems under-processed: expected more 1-filling or connections in shifting patterns (e.g., diagonal 9s to 5s might imply short row-wise links, but none added beyond existing 1s; bottom 3-5 transitions in rows 7-9 have 1s only at end, not bridging main gaps like row 9's abrupt 3-to-5 shift without 1s).
 * Specific differences: Row 0 all 0s (expected, no symbols); rows 1-2 have partial 9-clusters with trailing 0s (no fills, correct if no matches); row 3 has 9,9,9 then 0s to 5 (no 1s added, but might expect short fill if rules allow near-boundary); rows 6 has isolated 3 and 5 (no connection, likely correct per short-gap limit but feels incomplete for visual puzzle); 1s in later rows (e.g., row 5 col8) match small 5-1-5, which worked, but overall grid lacks cohesive paths, differing from expected "completed" structure.
 * The output makes partial sense for rigid short-gap rules (preserves structures, adds minimal 1s where possible), but does not fully resolve the test's complex layout (e.g., no handling for potential left-run extensions across >2 0s or 9-5 boundaries), indicating the program is too conservative and misses subtle connection opportunities.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 10:00:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid of integers (primarily 0s as empty space, with filled cells like 1, 3, 5, 9 representing different elements or states), where the goal is to process each row according to rules that remove invalid placements, fill logical gaps in runs of identical numbers, and extend or prune runs of 1s based on proximity and length constraints, ultimately transforming the input grid into a cleaned or completed output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The processing appears row-independent, applying transformations sequentially (remove misplaced 1s near 9s, fill short gaps in runs of other numbers with 1s, then handle isolated or extendable 1-runs to the left if gaps are <=3 cells).
 * Subtlety: In remove_misplaced_ones, 1s are zeroed only if co-occurring in a non-zero run with 9s, but this doesn't affect other numbers like 3 or 5, potentially missing interactions between different non-zero types.
 * Key: Gaps in runs (of any C !=0,1,9?) are filled with 1s only if <=3 cells and bounded by the same C on both sides; longer gaps or unbounded ones are left as 0s.
 * For 1-runs: Isolated leftward extensions happen only if the left gap to a non-zero is <=3, filling with 1s; otherwise, the entire 1-run is erased to 0s— this seems to prevent stray or invalid 1s but might over-prune if 1s should connect to other types.
 * Easy to miss: The program skips 0,1,9 in gap detection, so runs of 3 or 5 can have gaps filled, but 1s and 9s are treated specially (e.g., 1s not gapped the same way). No column-wise processing, so vertical alignments aren't enforced.
 * Considerations from attempts: Rules seem to prioritize short connections and removal of conflicts (e.g., 1s conflicting with 9s), but may not handle diagonal or multi-row shapes; 1s act as "connectors" or fillers, while 3,5,9 might represent distinct objects/shapes that shouldn't mix improperly.
 * Potential subtlety: The grid might represent a puzzle like a slitherlink or fill-a-pix, where numbers indicate clues for filling, but here it's post-processing an initial sketch to validate/complete based on run-length rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No custom classes or extraction functions were used; the program relies on row-wise iteration functions.

```python
def remove_misplaced_ones(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> None:
    # Identifies non-zero runs in a row; if a run contains both 9 and 1, zeros out all 1s in that run.
    # Helpful for cleaning conflicts between 9s (perhaps "blockers" or special fills) and 1s (connectors).
    # Works well for training cases with 9-1 mixes but may not generalize to other conflicts (e.g., 1 with 3/5).
```

```python
def fill_gaps(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> None:
    # Skips 0/1/9 cells, finds runs of identical C (>1, !=9?), then fills following 0-gaps (<=3) with 1s if bounded by same C.
    # Useful for completing short interruptions in shapes (e.g., 3s or 5s), assuming 1s as temporary fillers.
    # Subtle bug?: Gap filling assumes the gap is immediately after the run and checks only right-side bound; doesn't handle gaps within runs or left-side.
```

```python
def process_one_runs(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> None:
    # Finds isolated left-starting 1-runs; if left gap to non-zero <=3, fills gap with 1s; else erases the run.
    # Helpful for extending connectors leftward but only if short gap; ignores right extensions or vertical context.
    # Limitation: Only processes 1s not adjacent to prior 1s, potentially missing multi-run chains.
```

The main program function applies these in sequence per row, copying the grid first—solid structure, but no global validation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating good handling of basic run conflicts, short gap fills, and 1-run pruning/extensions in simpler cases.
 * What worked: remove_misplaced_ones effectively cleared invalid 1s near 9s; fill_gaps completed bounded short gaps; process_one_runs prevented stray 1s while extending logically, matching training expectations.
 * What didn't: No prior attempts, but inferred issues—the functions are row-only, so if the puzzle requires cross-row consistency (e.g., vertical runs of 5s or 3s), this fails; also, no handling for right-side gaps or non-left 1 extensions.
 * Missed potential: No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components of same numbers), which could help identify full shapes before processing; without it, subtle multi-row patterns like the test's diagonal-ish 9s or stepped 5s/3s aren't validated.
 * Function fill_gaps skips 1/9 runs for gapping, which worked for training but might incorrectly ignore gaps in 1-chains if they should connect differently.
 * process_one_runs only extends left and erases if >3 gap, but if training had rightward or bidirectional needs, it succeeded anyway—test may reveal over-erasure.
 * No unhelpful functions; all three are relevant but incomplete (e.g., could add column processing or object extraction for better shape awareness).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows progressive filling: row 0 all 0s (unchanged empty); rows 1-2 have partial 9-runs left-shifted; rows 3-5 build 9s then transition to 5s with a 1 in row 5 col 8; rows 6-9 build left 3s and right 5s with persistent 1s in col 8.
 * Observed effects: 9s form a diagonal-ish shape top-left, cleared of any 1s; 5s appear right/bottom with some 1s nearby (e.g., row 5 col 8=1, row 7-9 col 8=1); 3s fill bottom-left solidly; no gaps filled in 9s or 5s beyond what's shown, and 1s seem extended/pruned to col 8 positions.
 * Differences from expected: Without knowing exact rules, the output doesn't look fully "clean"—e.g., the 1s in col 8 across rows 5-9 suggest unpruned connectors, but if rules require vertical alignment or erasure if not bounded, they should be 0s; the abrupt 9-to-5 transition in rows 4-5 has 0-gaps not filled (longer than 3?), which makes sense per code but might miss a shape completion; bottom 3s and 5s don't connect via 1s horizontally, leaving isolated runs—expected if no short gaps, but visually the grid looks like incomplete objects (e.g., 5s stepping right without full fill). Overall, it partially makes sense (no misplaced 1s near 9s, short extensions possible), but likely incorrect if the puzzle expects more holistic shape completion (e.g., filling vertical gaps in 5s col 7-9 or connecting 3s to 5s via 1s across rows); the all-0 row 0 and sparse top suggest over-pruning, differing from a potentially denser expected output. It's different in that 1s persist in col 8 without left/right bounds checked vertically—unknown if that's intended, but it feels unpolished.

[2025-10-03 10:00:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, fills, or object parts in a 2D scene), where the goal is to process each row independently to clean up invalid patterns, fill logical gaps in "objects" defined by repeated numbers (like 3s or 5s), and handle runs of 1s (possibly connectors or fillers) based on adjacency and gap rules, ultimately producing a corrected grid that matches expected visual structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Numbers like 3, 5, 9 represent distinct "object" types or colors (e.g., 3 might be one shape, 5 another, 9 a temporary marker or boundary); 1s act as fillers or extensions that can be placed in 0-gaps but must be removed if misplaced near conflicting elements like 9s.
 * Process rows sequentially with passes: first remove invalid 1s in sequences mixing 9s and 1s (to avoid "misplaced" fillers near boundaries); then fill specific gap patterns between matching non-1/0/9 numbers (e.g., single or double 0-gaps between Cs, but only under limited conditions like adjacent to a 1); finally, validate and extend/shorten runs of 1s to the left based on gap length (l <=3 zeros allows filling with 1s, longer gaps remove the run entirely).
 * Subtlety: Gap filling is highly pattern-specific (e.g., for k=1: C-0-C fills to C-1-C; for k=2: C-0-0-C-1 fills first two 0s to 1s, but skips if not exactly matching); this misses broader propagation or vertical alignment considerations across rows.
 * 1-runs only extend leftward into 0-gaps if bounded by a non-0 and gap <=3; otherwise, delete the run—easy to miss that left-bound check (non-0 neighbor) prevents unbounded extension.
 * No vertical processing: rules are strictly per-row, but visual correctness implies row outputs should align to form coherent objects (e.g., columns of 3s building a shape).
 * 0s are empty space; avoid over-filling or creating new objects; 9s seem to block or mark invalid fills.
 * All considerations from attempts: Avoid global changes (row-only); handle runs starting at row edges carefully; don't fill gaps without exact matches (prevents overreach); track run boundaries precisely to avoid infinite loops in while loops.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: All functions applied properly, correctly removed/filled to match expected (likely simple patterns with no conflicts).
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated row 6 [0,0,3,0,0,3,5,1,1,5] vs expected [0,0,3,1,1,3,5,1,1,5]—missing 1s in positions 3-4 (under-filled gap between 3s); row 7-8 match; row 9 [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] vs expected [0,0,3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5] (minor leading difference, possibly from propagation error).
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex 9s and 1s without misremoval, suggesting remove_misplaced_ones and process_one_runs work for boundary-heavy cases.
 * Overall: remove_misplaced_ones is helpful and correct (no issues noted); fill_gaps is broken for gaps >1 without trailing 1 (causes under-fill in train 2); process_one_runs over-removes 1-runs when left gap >3 or unbounded (likely cause of train 2 row 6 error, as it deleted valid short-gap 1s).
 * No extract_objects function attempted—puzzle doesn't seem to need object extraction (row-wise only), so not relevant (don't use in future).
 * Subtle miss: fill_gaps skips if C is 9 or 1, but doesn't propagate fills across multiple gaps; process_one_runs only handles left extensions, ignoring right or vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows heavy 0-filling (e.g., row 1: [9,9,0,...] becomes all 0s except leading 9s? Wait, output row1 [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—partial, but 9s persist); row 4 has 9s partially cleared to 0s but trailing 5 intact; row 6 has 5-1-5 with leading 0s; row 10 [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,1,5] retains 1 near end.
 * Does not look correct: Expected likely involves filling 0-gaps between 3s/5s with 1s (e.g., row 7 has leading 3 then 0s—should fill to connect to lower 3s?); 9s in rows 1-5 should be cleared or converted entirely (generated leaves some 9s, but train 2 suggests 9s block 1s); row 6 [0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] under-filled (1 only between 5s, but leading 0s near 3 in row7 suggest vertical alignment for object completion); mismatches visual coherence (e.g., diagonal 9s in input should form/clear a shape, but output scatters 1s without connecting 3-5 objects).
 * Unknown why row 10 keeps isolated 1 (process_one_runs should remove if left-gap >3, but input has 3s before 5s—possible over-retention); overall, test under-fills connections (e.g., no 1s bridging 3s to 5s across rows) and leaves invalid 9s, indicating fill_gaps too restrictive for test's multi-gap patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving iterative row-wise operations to remove invalid sequences of 1's (likely representing a special filler or connector) and fill valid gaps with 1's, based on adjacency to other numbers, edges, and length constraints, simulating a matching or stabilization mechanic across 10x10 grids with various integer values representing colors or types.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Removal targets contiguous sequences of 1's: short ones (≤3) fully bounded by 0's or edges are removed; asymmetric cases allow removal if bounded on one side by a non-1/non-edge (but not 0/1/edge) and the other by 0, with length ≤2.
 * Filling targets contiguous gaps of 0's: only if length ≤3, not touching edges, and bounded by non-0's where at least one side is 1 or both sides match in value (non-1), but skips if any bound is 0.
 * Operations are applied sequentially: all removals across rows first, then all fillings, without iteration between them or column-wise effects, which may miss cascading changes.
 * 1's act as fillers but are not treated as "objects" like other numbers (2-9); they are transient and removed under isolation conditions, but can propagate filling if adjacent to gaps.
 * Subtle edge cases: 'edge' as a boundary type in removal (treated like 0 for isolation); fillings require both bounds non-0 but allow propagation from 1's; no vertical interactions, so rows are independent.
 * Grids use 0 for empty, 1 for filler, and 2-9 for stable objects; over-filling can occur if rules don't check for prior 1's or conflicting adjacencies.
 * Potential misses: removals don't handle sequences adjacent to same-number groups; fillings may incorrectly trigger near dissimilar numbers if one is 1; no handling for longer gaps (>3) or edge-touching gaps.
 * All considerations: row independence; no diagonal or multi-row effects; preserve non-1 numbers; output a modified copy of input grid.

        apply_row_removal(out, r)
    for r in range(10):
        apply_row_filling(out, r)
    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs, demonstrating core row-wise isolation removal and gap filling for simple cases).
 * Failed on training example 3: generated extra 1's in row 3 (positions 4-6: 1,1,1 instead of 0,0,0) and row 4 (positions 4-5: 1,1 instead of 0,0), while correctly removing/handling other parts like row 5's 9's; this suggests over-aggressive filling triggered by adjacent 9's and 1-propagation without checking for invalid contexts post-removal.
 * Removal logic worked for isolating 1's in training 3 (e.g., cleared some but not the problematic ones), but filling didn't: it filled gaps between 9's and existing 1's/9's where expected output left them as 0's, possibly because the condition "(left_c == right_c and left_c != 1) or left_c == 1 or right_c == 1" is too broad and allows filling near dissimilar stable numbers if a 1 is involved.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., groups of same numbers) were used or needed; the approach is purely sequence-scanning per row, which is helpful but misses potential group symmetries.
 * The asymmetric removal clause (non-1 left, 0 right, ≤2) may be untested or incorrect for training 3, as it didn't trigger needed removals.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of scanning for 1-sequences and 0-gaps but lacks refinement for when fillings should be blocked (e.g., between different non-1 numbers without exact match).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows removals and fillings, e.g., row 3 has [0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5] (extending 9's rightward, but input has [0, 0, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]? Wait, test input not fully shown, but assuming from pattern); however, mentally applying rules: if input has isolated 1's or gaps near 9's/5's, fillings like row 4's [0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 5] suggest merging 9's across a gap, but expected might not allow if bounds don't match (9 left, 0/5 right? unclear without full input).
 * Does not look fully correct: row 6 has [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5] (filling a 1 between 5's?), but if rules require symmetric non-1 bounds, this might be invalid if post-removal gap is >3 or edge-adjacent; row 8/9 show 3's and 5's extended, but expected could leave gaps if one bound is 1-propagated incorrectly, similar to training 3 error.
 * Row 9 [3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 1, 5] retains a 1 near 5's, which might not be removed if not isolated (≤3 bounded by 0/edge), but could be over-filled; overall, outputs propagate numbers/1's more than expected in training 3, suggesting same filling bug persists—e.g., 1 in row 6/8/9 looks suspicious and likely incorrect if rules block 1-fills between mismatched groups like 3 and 5.
 * To handle test: need stricter filling (e.g., require exact bound match without 1-propagation unless isolated); test exposes issues with multi-number rows (3,5 interactions) not seen in training 1/2.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a row-wise grid processing puzzle involving symbol-based pattern recognition and manipulation, where the goal is to clean invalid 1s (fillers or paths) near certain boundaries (like 9s), fill short gaps between matching non-boundary symbols with 1s, and validate or extend isolated 1-runs based on proximity to existing structures, likely to form connected regions or paths in a visual diagram.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * 9s appear to act as boundaries or invalidators for 1s; sequences containing both 9 and 1 should have 1s zeroed out to prevent invalid "misplaced" fillers.
 * Filling only applies to small, specific gaps (e.g., 1 or 2 zeros) between identical non-0/1/9 symbols (denoted as C), replacing them strictly with 1s (e.g., C-0-C becomes C-1-C); longer gaps or mismatched symbols are ignored, which can lead to under-filling in complex or extended patterns.
 * Isolated 1-runs (not adjacent to other 1s) are validated leftward: if a non-zero symbol is within 3 zeros to the left, fill the gap with 1s to connect; otherwise, remove the run entirely—subtleties include accurate gap counting (from run start leftward, stopping at first non-zero or boundary) and avoiding over-removal near edges.
 * Processing order matters: clean misplaced 1s first, then fill gaps, then validate runs, applied independently per row without column-wise interactions.
 * 1s represent temporary or connective fillers, but only persist if they form valid short connections; other numbers (e.g., 3,5) are structural and not altered except via filling between matches.
 * Easy-to-miss: No filling across different symbols (e.g., no 1s between 9 and 5); runs must be truly isolated (no left-adjacent 1); boundary hits (e.g., left edge) may invalidate runs if no connector found; no vertical processing, so rows are independent.
 * General considerations: Grid is 10x10; inputs have clustered symbols (e.g., diagonal/shifting 9s, bottom-right 5s, bottom-left 3s); output should preserve original non-0/1/9 symbols while minimally adding/removing 1s to "complete" patterns without overgeneralizing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed all three training examples, indicating good handling of basic cases for cleaning 1s near 9s, short gap filling between matching symbols, and run validation in simpler row patterns.
 * What worked: remove_misplaced_ones correctly zeros invalid 1s in mixed 9-1 sequences (key for boundary cleaning in training 1 and 3); fill_gaps handles k=1/2 gaps rigidly but accurately for direct matches (effective in training 2); process_one_runs validates short left connections without over-removal in most training cases.
 * What didn't work: process_one_runs has a bug in gap counting (starts from run_left-1 but may miscount if adjacent non-zero is misinterpreted, leading to potential boundary issues noted in training 2 comments); fill_gaps is too limited (only k=1/2, skips longer or non-exact matches, causing under-filling in rows with extended 0s); overall program under-processes complex shifts or non-short connections, as seen in minimal changes to test.
 * No prior attempts detailed, but comments in functions highlight partial successes (e.g., 1/3 training good for cleaning, but misses persistence in 2) and rigidity issues; no extraction functions used, but row-scanning approach is core and helpful for independent row processing.
 * Function remove_misplaced_ones is helpful and mostly correct (retain for future); fill_gaps is partially helpful but needs extension for longer gaps (improve, don't discard); process_one_runs is useful for validation but broken on edge cases/boundary hits (fix gap logic before reuse); no unhelpful functions noted, but rigid gap limits suggest avoiding without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal changes from what appears to be the input (e.g., isolated 1s persist in rows 5,7,8,9 at column 8, likely from existing or small fills like 5-1-5), but large 0-regions remain unfilled (e.g., row 6: single 3 followed by many 0s to distant 5; row 4: 9s separated from 5 by 0s), suggesting no action on longer gaps or mismatched symbols.
 * It does not look fully correct, as the output seems under-processed: expected more 1-filling or connections in shifting patterns (e.g., diagonal 9s to 5s might imply short row-wise links, but none added beyond existing 1s; bottom 3-5 transitions in rows 7-9 have 1s only at end, not bridging main gaps like row 9's abrupt 3-to-5 shift without 1s).
 * Specific differences: Row 0 all 0s (expected, no symbols); rows 1-2 have partial 9-clusters with trailing 0s (no fills, correct if no matches); row 3 has 9,9,9 then 0s to 5 (no 1s added, but might expect short fill if rules allow near-boundary); rows 6 has isolated 3 and 5 (no connection, likely correct per short-gap limit but feels incomplete for visual puzzle); 1s in later rows (e.g., row 5 col8) match small 5-1-5, which worked, but overall grid lacks cohesive paths, differing from expected "completed" structure.
 * The output makes partial sense for rigid short-gap rules (preserves structures, adds minimal 1s where possible), but does not fully resolve the test's complex layout (e.g., no handling for potential left-run extensions across >2 0s or 9-5 boundaries), indicating the program is too conservative and misses subtle connection opportunities.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid of integers (primarily 0s as empty space, with filled cells like 1, 3, 5, 9 representing different elements or states), where the goal is to process each row according to rules that remove invalid placements, fill logical gaps in runs of identical numbers, and extend or prune runs of 1s based on proximity and length constraints, ultimately transforming the input grid into a cleaned or completed output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The processing appears row-independent, applying transformations sequentially (remove misplaced 1s near 9s, fill short gaps in runs of other numbers with 1s, then handle isolated or extendable 1-runs to the left if gaps are <=3 cells).
 * Subtlety: In remove_misplaced_ones, 1s are zeroed only if co-occurring in a non-zero run with 9s, but this doesn't affect other numbers like 3 or 5, potentially missing interactions between different non-zero types.
 * Key: Gaps in runs (of any C !=0,1,9?) are filled with 1s only if <=3 cells and bounded by the same C on both sides; longer gaps or unbounded ones are left as 0s.
 * For 1-runs: Isolated leftward extensions happen only if the left gap to a non-zero is <=3, filling with 1s; otherwise, the entire 1-run is erased to 0s— this seems to prevent stray or invalid 1s but might over-prune if 1s should connect to other types.
 * Easy to miss: The program skips 0,1,9 in gap detection, so runs of 3 or 5 can have gaps filled, but 1s and 9s are treated specially (e.g., 1s not gapped the same way). No column-wise processing, so vertical alignments aren't enforced.
 * Considerations from attempts: Rules seem to prioritize short connections and removal of conflicts (e.g., 1s conflicting with 9s), but may not handle diagonal or multi-row shapes; 1s act as "connectors" or fillers, while 3,5,9 might represent distinct objects/shapes that shouldn't mix improperly.
 * Potential subtlety: The grid might represent a puzzle like a slitherlink or fill-a-pix, where numbers indicate clues for filling, but here it's post-processing an initial sketch to validate/complete based on run-length rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No custom classes or extraction functions were used; the program relies on row-wise iteration functions.

```python
def remove_misplaced_ones(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> None:
    # Identifies non-zero runs in a row; if a run contains both 9 and 1, zeros out all 1s in that run.
    # Helpful for cleaning conflicts between 9s (perhaps "blockers" or special fills) and 1s (connectors).
    # Works well for training cases with 9-1 mixes but may not generalize to other conflicts (e.g., 1 with 3/5).
```

```python
def fill_gaps(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> None:
    # Skips 0/1/9 cells, finds runs of identical C (>1, !=9?), then fills following 0-gaps (<=3) with 1s if bounded by same C.
    # Useful for completing short interruptions in shapes (e.g., 3s or 5s), assuming 1s as temporary fillers.
    # Subtle bug?: Gap filling assumes the gap is immediately after the run and checks only right-side bound; doesn't handle gaps within runs or left-side.
```

```python
def process_one_runs(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> None:
    # Finds isolated left-starting 1-runs; if left gap to non-zero <=3, fills gap with 1s; else erases the run.
    # Helpful for extending connectors leftward but only if short gap; ignores right extensions or vertical context.
    # Limitation: Only processes 1s not adjacent to prior 1s, potentially missing multi-run chains.
```

The main program function applies these in sequence per row, copying the grid first—solid structure, but no global validation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly solved all three training examples, indicating good handling of basic run conflicts, short gap fills, and 1-run pruning/extensions in simpler cases.
 * What worked: remove_misplaced_ones effectively cleared invalid 1s near 9s; fill_gaps completed bounded short gaps; process_one_runs prevented stray 1s while extending logically, matching training expectations.
 * What didn't: No prior attempts, but inferred issues—the functions are row-only, so if the puzzle requires cross-row consistency (e.g., vertical runs of 5s or 3s), this fails; also, no handling for right-side gaps or non-left 1 extensions.
 * Missed potential: No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components of same numbers), which could help identify full shapes before processing; without it, subtle multi-row patterns like the test's diagonal-ish 9s or stepped 5s/3s aren't validated.
 * Function fill_gaps skips 1/9 runs for gapping, which worked for training but might incorrectly ignore gaps in 1-chains if they should connect differently.
 * process_one_runs only extends left and erases if >3 gap, but if training had rightward or bidirectional needs, it succeeded anyway—test may reveal over-erasure.
 * No unhelpful functions; all three are relevant but incomplete (e.g., could add column processing or object extraction for better shape awareness).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows progressive filling: row 0 all 0s (unchanged empty); rows 1-2 have partial 9-runs left-shifted; rows 3-5 build 9s then transition to 5s with a 1 in row 5 col 8; rows 6-9 build left 3s and right 5s with persistent 1s in col 8.
 * Observed effects: 9s form a diagonal-ish shape top-left, cleared of any 1s; 5s appear right/bottom with some 1s nearby (e.g., row 5 col 8=1, row 7-9 col 8=1); 3s fill bottom-left solidly; no gaps filled in 9s or 5s beyond what's shown, and 1s seem extended/pruned to col 8 positions.
 * Differences from expected: Without knowing exact rules, the output doesn't look fully "clean"—e.g., the 1s in col 8 across rows 5-9 suggest unpruned connectors, but if rules require vertical alignment or erasure if not bounded, they should be 0s; the abrupt 9-to-5 transition in rows 4-5 has 0-gaps not filled (longer than 3?), which makes sense per code but might miss a shape completion; bottom 3s and 5s don't connect via 1s horizontally, leaving isolated runs—expected if no short gaps, but visually the grid looks like incomplete objects (e.g., 5s stepping right without full fill). Overall, it partially makes sense (no misplaced 1s near 9s, short extensions possible), but likely incorrect if the puzzle expects more holistic shape completion (e.g., filling vertical gaps in 5s col 7-9 or connecting 3s to 5s via 1s across rows); the all-0 row 0 and sparse top suggest over-pruning, differing from a potentially denser expected output. It's different in that 1s persist in col 8 without left/right bounds checked vertically—unknown if that's intended, but it feels unpolished.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:07:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a 10x10 grid of integers (0s as empty, 1s as temporary fillers/connectors, 9s as boundaries/markers, and other numbers like 3 or 5 as stable objects or colors) to clean invalid elements, fill short interruptions, and validate connections horizontally per row, ultimately producing a refined grid with completed object runs and removed artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules focus on horizontal processing only (row-independent); no vertical or diagonal interactions.
 * 9s act as boundaries that invalidate nearby 1s if mixed in the same contiguous non-zero sequence—1s in such sequences must be zeroed out to avoid false connections across edges.
 * Short gaps (1-3 zeros) between identical non-0/1/9 values (e.g., 5-0-5 becomes 5-1-5) are filled with 1s to complete interrupted object runs, but only for matching values and only up to 3 zeros (longer gaps remain unfilled).
 * 1-runs are validated leftward: if adjacent to a non-zero or within <=3 zeros of one, extend/fill the gap with 1s to connect; otherwise, remove the entire 1-run as isolated/unbounded noise.
 * Subtleties: Processing order matters—first remove misplaced 1s (near 9s), then fill gaps (to create valid short connections), then validate 1-runs (to extend or prune); skipping order could create invalid fills.
 * Contiguous sequences are strictly non-zero runs; zeros separate them, so 1s can't bridge across long zeros or different objects.
 * Objects (non-0/1/9) like 3 or 5 are stable and not altered except via gap-filling between matches.
 * Edge cases: Leading/trailing 1s without left bounds get removed; 1s already adjacent to objects are kept; no filling if gap >3 or non-matching values.
 * No global grid checks (e.g., no object counting or vertical alignment); purely local row rules.
 * Potential misses: Over-filling (e.g., connecting unrelated objects via 1s), under-removal of 1s near 9s, or failing to propagate fills after initial removals.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly passed all three training examples, indicating solid handling of basic cases like boundary cleaning, short gap fills, and 1-run validation in simpler grids.
 * Worked well: remove_misplaced_ones effectively zeros 1s mixed with 9s without touching objects; fill_gaps completes 1-3 zero interruptions between matches; process_one_runs prunes isolated 1s and extends bounded ones.
 * Did not work: In complex test cases, may fail to iteratively apply rules if multiple passes are needed (e.g., a fill creating a new 1-run that needs validation); no rightward validation for 1-runs, only leftward, which could leave asymmetric connections.
 * Subtle miss: Gap filling skips if starting from 1 or 9, but post-removal 1s might need re-filling; no handling for 1s created during fills being immediately invalidated if near 9s elsewhere.
 * Overall composition in program() applies rules sequentially per row, which worked for training but may need loops for convergence in test (e.g., repeated fills/pruning until stable).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all three core functions are relevant and demonstrate understanding of the rules; no broken extras like object extraction (not needed, as rules are local).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows partial structure: 9s form a diagonal-ish boundary in rows 1-4; 5s appear in a descending pattern from row 3 col 9 to row 9 col 4-9, with some 1s in row 5 (col 8) and rows 7-9 (col 8); 3s build leftward in rows 6-9 cols 0-3.
 * Does not look fully correct: Row 6 has isolated 3 at col 0 followed by 6+ zeros to 5 at col 9—no fill attempted (correct, as gap >3 and different objects), but row 7 has 3s at cols 0-1, then 4 zeros to 5s at col 6, with 1 at col 8 between 5s (partial fill?); expected more connection for 5s in rows 7-9 (e.g., row 7: 5 at col 6-7, 1 at 8, 5 at 9—looks like a 2-zero gap was filled to 1s, but only one 1 shown, suggesting incomplete or mismatched fill).
 * Differences from expected: Expected full 1-fills for short 5-gaps (e.g., row 5: 5-1-5 is correct for 1-zero gap, but row 8/9 have 5s with 1 at col 8—possibly a 1-zero gap filled, but if input had 2-3 zeros, it should have more 1s); 3s in rows 6-9 seem unconnected rightward (correct, long gaps), but row 6's single 3 might be isolated if no left bound (should remain if stable object). Row 0 all zeros is fine, but overall grid feels under-processed—e.g., no extension of 1s leftward in row 5/7-9 if gaps exist; possible bug in process_one_runs not filling if hit is 0-bound or order issue post-fill.
 * The 1s persisting near 5s suggest fill_gaps worked, but process_one_runs may not have extended them left if gaps >0, or removed if unbounded; looks like 1s are kept but not propagated, differing from expectation of connected runs (e.g., row 9 should perhaps have 3s connected to 5s via 1s if gap <=3, but col 4 is 5 after 3 at col 3—no zero shown, so adjacent? Wait, [3,3,3,3,5,...] is direct adjacency, correct no fill needed).
 * Unknown why row 6 has 3 with no right connection, but if input had 1s there, they were likely removed as unbounded—seems correct, but test may require vertical context (subtlety: rules are horizontal only, so okay).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 10:07:38] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, only the following connections and interactions are consistent across **every** puzzle (input to output). These are limited to obvious, directly observable patterns in shape properties (e.g., color, position via bbox, size via pixels). No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced connections are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., black background, which shows no consistent interaction) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear elements (e.g., specific movement rules for Blues) are noted as unknown where applicable. All shapes have holes=0 consistently, but this is a static property with no observed interaction.

#### 1. **Static Components (Non-Blue Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: Red, Green, Orange, Light Blue, Yellow shapes (individual instances).
   - **Properties**: Color, bbox (position and extent), pixels (size/mass).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: These shapes exhibit **no transformation or movement**. Every instance in the input has an identical counterpart in the output (exact same color, bbox, and pixels). This consistency holds across all three train examples, with no changes even when Blues overlap or adjoin them in bbox coordinates.
     - Examples:
       - Green: Always unchanged (e.g., input1 [5,2,7,9] pixels=14 → output1 same; input2 [2,0,5,9] pixels=17 → output2 same; present but no Green in input3).
       - Red: Always unchanged (input1 [1,7,4,9] pixels=6 → output1 same; input3 [0,7,2,9] pixels=6 → output3 same; absent in input2).
       - Orange: Always unchanged (input2 [6,6,9,9] pixels=10 → output2 same; absent in inputs 1 and 3).
       - Light Blue: Always unchanged (input3 two instances [0,1,3,4] pixels=7 and [5,1,9,5] pixels=9 → output3 same; absent in inputs 1 and 2).
       - Yellow: Always unchanged (input3 [3,6,5,9] pixels=8 → output3 same; absent in inputs 1 and 2).
   - **Interconnection with Others**: No direct effect on or from other components observed (e.g., no pixel transfer, no bbox shifts). However, their fixed positions (bbox) are consistently present during Blue transformations, suggesting a potential positional reference role (unknown mechanism—cannot explain how or if they influence Blues without solving).

#### 2. **Dynamic Components (Blue Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: All Blue shapes (multiple instances may exist; Light Blue treated as separate/static, not interacting with Blue).
   - **Properties**: Color (always Blue), bbox (position and extent), pixels (size/mass).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Blue shapes **interact collectively with each other**, rearranging configurations while conserving total pixels across input to output. Individual Blues may split, merge, appear, or disappear, but the sum of all Blue pixels remains exactly the same in every example. No holes or color changes occur.
     - Total Pixel Conservation (consistent in all examples):
       - Input1: 20 Blue pixels → Output1: 16 + 4 = 20.
       - Input2: 21 + 4 = 25 Blue pixels → Output2: 25.
       - Input3: 3 Blue pixels → Output3: 2 + 1 = 3.
     - Specific Patterns:
       - **Splitting/Merging**: Blues can divide into multiple smaller shapes or combine into fewer/larger ones (e.g., input1: 1 Blue → 2 Blues; input2: 2 Blues → 1 Blue; input3: 1 Blue → 2 Blues). This is the only direct interaction observed among Blues.
       - **Position Changes (bbox)**: Individual Blue bboxes shift (e.g., input1 main Blue y-start from 0→2, new Blue added at [6,5,6,8]; input2 Blues expand to [3,4,9,8]; input3 original [2,1,3,2] → new at [4,7,4,8] and [1,8,1,8]). Shifts are consistent in occurring but unpredictable in direction/magnitude (unknown rule—e.g., no clear pattern like uniform leftward movement or fixed distance).
       - **Size Changes (pixels per shape)**: Individual sizes vary post-interaction (e.g., input1: 20 → 16 and 4; input3: 3 → 2 and 1), but always sum to input total.
   - **Interconnection with Others**: No pixel transfer or color mixing with non-Blue shapes (statics remain unchanged). Blue bboxes may overlap or adjoin static shapes' bboxes post-transformation (e.g., output1 new Blue [6,5,6,8] overlaps Green [5,2,7,9] in x/y; output3 new Blue [4,7,4,8] overlaps Yellow [3,6,5,9] in x/y; output2 Blue [3,4,9,8] overlaps Green [2,0,5,9] in x). However, statics are unaffected, so any influence (e.g., static positions guiding Blue splits/merges) is unknown—cannot explain transformation details.

#### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No Other Consistent Interactions**: No observed connections involving holes (always 0, no effect), silhouettes/edges (not detailed enough in data), or color-to-color effects beyond Blue self-interaction. No consistent movement based on color alone (e.g., Reds/Greens don't trigger anything). Semantic meanings (e.g., "stack heights") not identifiable from bbox/pixels alone, so ignored.
- **Inconsistencies Avoided**: Not all puzzles have the same non-Blue colors (e.g., no Orange in input1), so no cross-color interactions claimed. Blue transformations vary (split vs. merge), so only conservation and self-interaction are listed as consistent.
- **Unknowns**: The exact mechanism driving Blue bbox shifts or split/merge decisions is unknown (e.g., may depend on relative positions to static shapes, but no consistent pattern explainable without solving). Pixel counts imply filled rectangles, but no interaction with "emptiness" or background noted.
- **Relevance to Test Input 1**: The test has multiple Blues (total pixels=2+3=5, positions varying), Light Blue (likely static), Oranges (likely static), and Green (likely static). Expected behavior: Non-Blues unchanged; Blues rearrange with total 5 pixels conserved (but do not predict details).

[2025-10-03 10:08:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, only the following connections and interactions are consistent across **every** puzzle (input to output). These are limited to obvious, directly observable patterns in shape properties (e.g., color, position via bbox, size via pixels). No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced connections are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., black background, which shows no consistent interaction) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear elements (e.g., specific movement rules for Blues) are noted as unknown where applicable. All shapes have holes=0 consistently, but this is a static property with no observed interaction.

#### 1. **Static Components (Non-Blue Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: Red, Green, Orange, Light Blue, Yellow shapes (individual instances).
   - **Properties**: Color, bbox (position and extent), pixels (size/mass).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: These shapes exhibit **no transformation or movement**. Every instance in the input has an identical counterpart in the output (exact same color, bbox, and pixels). This consistency holds across all three train examples, with no changes even when Blues overlap or adjoin them in bbox coordinates.
     - Examples:
       - Green: Always unchanged (e.g., input1 [5,2,7,9] pixels=14 → output1 same; input2 [2,0,5,9] pixels=17 → output2 same; present but no Green in input3).
       - Red: Always unchanged (input1 [1,7,4,9] pixels=6 → output1 same; input3 [0,7,2,9] pixels=6 → output3 same; absent in input2).
       - Orange: Always unchanged (input2 [6,6,9,9] pixels=10 → output2 same; absent in inputs 1 and 3).
       - Light Blue: Always unchanged (input3 two instances [0,1,3,4] pixels=7 and [5,1,9,5] pixels=9 → output3 same; absent in inputs 1 and 2).
       - Yellow: Always unchanged (input3 [3,6,5,9] pixels=8 → output3 same; absent in inputs 1 and 2).
   - **Interconnection with Others**: No direct effect on or from other components observed (e.g., no pixel transfer, no bbox shifts). However, their fixed positions (bbox) are consistently present during Blue transformations, suggesting a potential positional reference role (unknown mechanism—cannot explain how or if they influence Blues without solving).

#### 2. **Dynamic Components (Blue Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: All Blue shapes (multiple instances may exist; Light Blue treated as separate/static, not interacting with Blue).
   - **Properties**: Color (always Blue), bbox (position and extent), pixels (size/mass).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Blue shapes **interact collectively with each other**, rearranging configurations while conserving total pixels across input to output. Individual Blues may split, merge, appear, or disappear, but the sum of all Blue pixels remains exactly the same in every example. No holes or color changes occur.
     - Total Pixel Conservation (consistent in all examples):
       - Input1: 20 Blue pixels → Output1: 16 + 4 = 20.
       - Input2: 21 + 4 = 25 Blue pixels → Output2: 25.
       - Input3: 3 Blue pixels → Output3: 2 + 1 = 3.
     - Specific Patterns:
       - **Splitting/Merging**: Blues can divide into multiple smaller shapes or combine into fewer/larger ones (e.g., input1: 1 Blue → 2 Blues; input2: 2 Blues → 1 Blue; input3: 1 Blue → 2 Blues). This is the only direct interaction observed among Blues.
       - **Position Changes (bbox)**: Individual Blue bboxes shift (e.g., input1 main Blue y-start from 0→2, new Blue added at [6,5,6,8]; input2 Blues expand to [3,4,9,8]; input3 original [2,1,3,2] → new at [4,7,4,8] and [1,8,1,8]). Shifts are consistent in occurring but unpredictable in direction/magnitude (unknown rule—e.g., no clear pattern like uniform leftward movement or fixed distance).
       - **Size Changes (pixels per shape)**: Individual sizes vary post-interaction (e.g., input1: 20 → 16 and 4; input3: 3 → 2 and 1), but always sum to input total.
   - **Interconnection with Others**: No pixel transfer or color mixing with non-Blue shapes (statics remain unchanged). Blue bboxes may overlap or adjoin static shapes' bboxes post-transformation (e.g., output1 new Blue [6,5,6,8] overlaps Green [5,2,7,9] in x/y; output3 new Blue [4,7,4,8] overlaps Yellow [3,6,5,9] in x/y; output2 Blue [3,4,9,8] overlaps Green [2,0,5,9] in x). However, statics are unaffected, so any influence (e.g., static positions guiding Blue splits/merges) is unknown—cannot explain transformation details.

#### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No Other Consistent Interactions**: No observed connections involving holes (always 0, no effect), silhouettes/edges (not detailed enough in data), or color-to-color effects beyond Blue self-interaction. No consistent movement based on color alone (e.g., Reds/Greens don't trigger anything). Semantic meanings (e.g., "stack heights") not identifiable from bbox/pixels alone, so ignored.
- **Inconsistencies Avoided**: Not all puzzles have the same non-Blue colors (e.g., no Orange in input1), so no cross-color interactions claimed. Blue transformations vary (split vs. merge), so only conservation and self-interaction are listed as consistent.
- **Unknowns**: The exact mechanism driving Blue bbox shifts or split/merge decisions is unknown (e.g., may depend on relative positions to static shapes, but no consistent pattern explainable without solving). Pixel counts imply filled rectangles, but no interaction with "emptiness" or background noted.
- **Relevance to Test Input 1**: The test has multiple Blues (total pixels=2+3=5, positions varying), Light Blue (likely static), Oranges (likely static), and Green (likely static). Expected behavior: Non-Blues unchanged; Blues rearrange with total 5 pixels conserved (but do not predict details).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:24:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a 10x10 grid-based logic puzzle involving colored regions (numbers 3,5 as colors, 9 as a special marker, 1 as blue/fill, 0 as empty), where the task is to deduce and apply fills (set 0s to 1s) for small gaps between compatible components horizontally or vertically, and clears (set 1s to 0s) for isolated blue segments or blues adjacent to 9s, resulting in an updated grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Horizontal components are sequences of non-zero cells in a row; colors are collected only for non-1 cells; a component is "fixed" if it has any non-1 colors; gaps between components are fillable with 1s if size 1-3, neither has 9, and either both fixed with common color and gap <=2, or not both fixed and gap <=3.
 * Vertical fills only apply to same-color (non-0, non-1) segments in a column separated by exactly one gap cell (size=1), ignoring 1s and 0s as non-component; this can overlap with horizontal rules.
 * Clears target all-1 segments (no non-1 colors) in rows if isolated (no prior component within a gap of <=3 zeros, including leading-edge cases where prev_end=-1); also clear individual 1s within row segments containing 9.
 * Subtlety: 9 acts as a blocker for horizontal fills (presence in either adjacent component prevents fill) but is treated as a fixed color itself; 1s are neutral/blank but can be part of components for gap detection without contributing to colors.
 * Order matters: Fills are applied first (set to 1), then clears (set to 0), so a cell filled by vertical rules might be cleared by horizontal segment rules if it creates or joins an all-1 segment.
 * Components skip leading/trailing 0s but include 1s in spans for horizontal analysis; vertical skips both 0s and 1s for color segments.
 * Easy to miss: Gap size calculation (end1 +1 to start2 -1); prev component detection in clears counts only non-zero prev_end; single-cell components count; large gaps (>3) always block.
 * No diagonal or multi-color mixing beyond common colors; no fills if gap=0 (adjacent) or >3; 9-containing mixed segments only clear 1s, not the 9s themselves.
 * All considerations: Fills promote connectivity of same-color regions via blue bridges; clears remove unsupported or conflicting blues; puzzle likely enforces no over-filling near 9s or isolated blues to avoid invalid structures.

        while i < 10 and g[i][c] != 0 and g[i][c] != 1:
            i += 1
        end = i - 1
        comps.append((start, end, color))
    return comps
```

```python
# The provided find_horizontal_fills, find_vertical_fills, and find_clears are helpful and core to the solution, as they implement the rules directly; use them as basis but debug clear logic for isolation gaps.
# No types beyond List[List[int]] for grid; Tuple[int,int] for positions; Set[int] for colors.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single (first) attempt provided; it successfully solved all three training examples, demonstrating understanding of core fill and clear rules for those cases.
 * What worked: Horizontal gap filling with common color checks and size limits; vertical same-color gap=1 fills; basic clear of isolated all-1 segments and 1s near 9s, as validated by training correctness.
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the generated output matches the input grid exactly (no changes applied), but manual simulation shows the program should fill (6,7) via vertical rules (gap=1 between 5s in col7, rows 5 and 7-9) setting it to 1, then clear it via horizontal rules (isolated all-1 segment in row6 with gap=6 >3 to prior 3 at col0), netting a change to 0 at (6,7); since output retains 1, either execution bug, reporting error, or unhandled interaction between vertical fill and horizontal clear.
 * No other obvious fills in test (e.g., row3-4 9s have large gaps; row9 no gaps; col0 3s are contiguous from row6-9), but potential missed clears like row5 col8=1 in mixed 5-segment (no 9, so not cleared) or row7-9 col8=1s (mixed with 5s, no 9).
 * extract_horizontal_comps and extract_vertical_comps (derived from code) are essential for identifying components and gaps; the full find_* functions are helpful but the clear logic for prev_end/gap in all_one cases may be buggy if j-loop stops incorrectly on non-zero.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though find_clears may need fix for gap calculation when prev component exists (e.g., ensure prev_end set only if j>=0 after loop).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is identical to the input grid, with all cells unchanged (e.g., row6 remains [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 5], row5 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 1, 5]).
 * This does not look correct, as the rules require at least one change: the 1 at (6,7) should be cleared to 0 due to isolation (gap=6 >3 to prior component at col0), and even if vertical fill applies first (setting the existing 1 to 1 again), the subsequent clear should set it to 0; retaining 1 indicates the clear logic failed to trigger or was overridden.
 * No other fills/clears appear applied (e.g., no filling of 0s in col7 row6 despite qualifying vertical gap; no clearing of col8 1s in row5/7/8/9 as they lack 9s; row0 all-0s unchanged, correct as no components).
 * The lack of changes suggests the program did not detect the vertical gap or the horizontal isolation properly, differing from expected output where (6,7)=0 and possibly other isolated 1s cleared if present; unknown why vertical comp extraction skipped the gap or clear gap calc erred (e.g., if prev_end mis-set to -1 incorrectly).
 * Overall, test output makes no sense as a solved puzzle, as it ignores clearable unsupported blues, violating isolation rules.

[2025-10-03 10:25:30] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear in **every** training example (no assumptions from incomplete or varying patterns). Only direct, observable consistencies are included—e.g., no forced explanations for unclear transformations (marked as unknown where the "how" cannot be explained without speculation). Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, grid alignment, empty spaces) are excluded as they show no interaction or effect on changes. Semantic meanings (e.g., "stacked bars" or "L-shapes") are not used, as they are not consistently tied to transformations across all examples.

#### 1. **Color → Dynamic/Static Behavior**
   - **Connection**: Shapes of color "Blue" are dynamic (always change in number of components, bbox, or individual pixel counts), while all non-Blue colors (e.g., Green, Red, Orange, Light Blue, Yellow) are static (unchanged).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every example—Blues transform; non-Blues retain identical properties.
   - **Interaction Effect**: Non-Blue shapes act as "barriers" or reference points for Blue repositioning (Blues align adjacent to them in outputs, e.g., next to Green in train 1/2, Red/Yellow in train 3), but non-Blues are unaffected by Blues.
   - **Unknown**: Why only "Blue" is dynamic (Light Blue is static despite color similarity).

#### 2. **Pixel Count (Blue Total) → Conservation**
   - **Connection**: Total pixel count across all Blue components is conserved from input to output.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (20 → 20), Train 2 (25 → 25), Train 3 (3 → 3).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Blue pixels are redistributed among Blue components (via split or merge), but the aggregate remains fixed—no creation or loss.
   - **Unknown**: Rule for redistribution (e.g., why split into specific sizes like 16+4 or 2+1; individual counts vary without clear pattern).

#### 3. **Position (Bbox Y-Coordinates) → Downward Shift for Blues**
   - **Connection**: Blue components shift to higher y-values (downward if y=0 is top) in outputs compared to inputs.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (y=0-9 → y=2-9 and y=5-8), Train 2 (y=1-8/y=7-8 → y=4-8), Train 3 (y=1-2 → y=7-8 and y=8).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Shifts stop at or near static non-Blue shapes' y-positions (e.g., aligning bottoms with Green/Red/Yellow at y=7-9), suggesting position of non-Blues constrains Blue y-movement.
   - **Unknown**: Exact stopping mechanism (e.g., why y=2 cutoff in train 1 vs. y=4 in train 2).

#### 4. **Position (Bbox X-Coordinates) → Leftward Shift for Blues**
   - **Connection**: Blue components shift to lower x-values (leftward) in outputs compared to inputs.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (x=8-9 → x=8-9 and x=6), Train 2 (x=6-9/x=3-4 → x=3-9), Train 3 (x=2-3 → x=4 and x=1).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Shifts align Blues adjacent to static non-Blue x-positions (e.g., next to Green at x=5 in train 1/2, Red at x=0-2/Yellow at x=3-5 in train 3), indicating non-Blue x-positions influence Blue placement.
   - **Unknown**: Why partial shifts (e.g., one part stays right in train 1) or merging extent (e.g., full x=3-9 fill in train 2).

#### 5. **Number of Blue Components → Variability via Split/Merge**
   - **Connection**: Number of distinct Blue components can increase (split) or decrease (merge) from input to output.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (1 → 2), Train 2 (2 → 1), Train 3 (1 → 2).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Depends on proximity to other Blues or static shapes in input (e.g., close Blues merge in train 2; isolated Blue splits near multiple statics in train 1/3).
   - **Unknown**: Trigger for split vs. merge (e.g., distance thresholds or overlap rules not consistent enough to explain).

#### 6. **Holes → No Interaction**
   - **Connection**: All shapes (Blue and non-Blue) have holes=0 in inputs and outputs.
   - **Consistency**: No change or creation of holes in any example.
   - **Interaction Effect**: None—holes do not influence or result from other properties (e.g., no holes form during Blue transformations).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., color-to-color effects beyond Blue/non-Blue, or pixel count affecting non-Blues). These patterns do not fully explain transformations but highlight reliable connections.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 10:26:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear in **every** training example (no assumptions from incomplete or varying patterns). Only direct, observable consistencies are included—e.g., no forced explanations for unclear transformations (marked as unknown where the "how" cannot be explained without speculation). Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, grid alignment, empty spaces) are excluded as they show no interaction or effect on changes. Semantic meanings (e.g., "stacked bars" or "L-shapes") are not used, as they are not consistently tied to transformations across all examples.

#### 1. **Color → Dynamic/Static Behavior**
   - **Connection**: Shapes of color "Blue" are dynamic (always change in number of components, bbox, or individual pixel counts), while all non-Blue colors (e.g., Green, Red, Orange, Light Blue, Yellow) are static (unchanged).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every example—Blues transform; non-Blues retain identical properties.
   - **Interaction Effect**: Non-Blue shapes act as "barriers" or reference points for Blue repositioning (Blues align adjacent to them in outputs, e.g., next to Green in train 1/2, Red/Yellow in train 3), but non-Blues are unaffected by Blues.
   - **Unknown**: Why only "Blue" is dynamic (Light Blue is static despite color similarity).

#### 2. **Pixel Count (Blue Total) → Conservation**
   - **Connection**: Total pixel count across all Blue components is conserved from input to output.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (20 → 20), Train 2 (25 → 25), Train 3 (3 → 3).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Blue pixels are redistributed among Blue components (via split or merge), but the aggregate remains fixed—no creation or loss.
   - **Unknown**: Rule for redistribution (e.g., why split into specific sizes like 16+4 or 2+1; individual counts vary without clear pattern).

#### 3. **Position (Bbox Y-Coordinates) → Downward Shift for Blues**
   - **Connection**: Blue components shift to higher y-values (downward if y=0 is top) in outputs compared to inputs.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (y=0-9 → y=2-9 and y=5-8), Train 2 (y=1-8/y=7-8 → y=4-8), Train 3 (y=1-2 → y=7-8 and y=8).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Shifts stop at or near static non-Blue shapes' y-positions (e.g., aligning bottoms with Green/Red/Yellow at y=7-9), suggesting position of non-Blues constrains Blue y-movement.
   - **Unknown**: Exact stopping mechanism (e.g., why y=2 cutoff in train 1 vs. y=4 in train 2).

#### 4. **Position (Bbox X-Coordinates) → Leftward Shift for Blues**
   - **Connection**: Blue components shift to lower x-values (leftward) in outputs compared to inputs.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (x=8-9 → x=8-9 and x=6), Train 2 (x=6-9/x=3-4 → x=3-9), Train 3 (x=2-3 → x=4 and x=1).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Shifts align Blues adjacent to static non-Blue x-positions (e.g., next to Green at x=5 in train 1/2, Red at x=0-2/Yellow at x=3-5 in train 3), indicating non-Blue x-positions influence Blue placement.
   - **Unknown**: Why partial shifts (e.g., one part stays right in train 1) or merging extent (e.g., full x=3-9 fill in train 2).

#### 5. **Number of Blue Components → Variability via Split/Merge**
   - **Connection**: Number of distinct Blue components can increase (split) or decrease (merge) from input to output.
   - **Consistency**: Train 1 (1 → 2), Train 2 (2 → 1), Train 3 (1 → 2).
   - **Interaction Effect**: Depends on proximity to other Blues or static shapes in input (e.g., close Blues merge in train 2; isolated Blue splits near multiple statics in train 1/3).
   - **Unknown**: Trigger for split vs. merge (e.g., distance thresholds or overlap rules not consistent enough to explain).

#### 6. **Holes → No Interaction**
   - **Connection**: All shapes (Blue and non-Blue) have holes=0 in inputs and outputs.
   - **Consistency**: No change or creation of holes in any example.
   - **Interaction Effect**: None—holes do not influence or result from other properties (e.g., no holes form during Blue transformations).

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., color-to-color effects beyond Blue/non-Blue, or pixel count affecting non-Blues). These patterns do not fully explain transformations but highlight reliable connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
