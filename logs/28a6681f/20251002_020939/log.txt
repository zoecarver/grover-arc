=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 02:09:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:19:32] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 10x10 grid where numbers represent colors or elements (e.g., 0 as empty, 1 as a filler like white or connector, and higher numbers like 9, 4, 5 as distinct objects or shapes). The goal appears to be cleaning up or simplifying the grid by removing stray or invalid groups of 1's (e.g., isolated or poorly connected segments) while preserving main shapes formed by other numbers, and possibly filling certain gaps under specific conditions, all processed row-by-row.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying and removing "stray" sequences of 1's in each row, but only if they are isolated (e.g., separated by 4+ zeros from non-0/non-1 elements on the left, or with insufficient open space on the right like <3 zeros).
 * Filling gaps between non-zero elements with 1's only if the gap is internal (not at edges), bounded by matching or specific values (e.g., same left/right values or right being 1), but this seems overly permissive and leads to incorrect fills in some cases.
 * Subtlety: Removals and fills are row-independent, but the overall effect should form coherent shapes across rows (e.g., in training example 3, the top forms a triangle of 9's with internal 0's, not filled 1's; bottom shapes like 4's and 2's remain intact).
 * Key consideration: 1's act as temporary fillers or connectors that should be removed if they don't belong to a valid structure (e.g., not part of a main object); avoid filling gaps indiscriminately, as this can incorrectly extend shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Edge cases like gaps at row starts/ends should not be filled; right-open space for removal decisions needs precise thresholding (e.g., >=3 zeros to justify keeping, but logic inverted in current code).
 * Across attempts: No column-wise processing, so vertical connections are ignored—may need holistic grid analysis; preserve non-1/non-0 elements exactly; 1's in bottom rows (e.g., with 2's, 4's) are sometimes valid and should not be removed.
 * No extraction of full objects yet; future attempts may need functions to detect blobs or connected components across rows/columns for better stray detection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def remove_stray_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Existing function is partially helpful for detecting sequences of 1's and basic isolation checks (left separation >=4 or right open >=3),
    # but buggy: it sometimes fails to remove valid strays (e.g., in training 3, keeps long 1-runs bounded by 9's) and inverts removal logic.
    # Use as base but fix conditions: always remove 1-sequences if left sep >=4 AND right open <3, or if fully isolated.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] == 1:
            start = i
            while i < 10 and new_row[i] == 1:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            # ... (rest as in attempt, but refine remove logic)
    return new_row
```

```python
def fill_gaps_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Partially helpful for gap detection, but overfills (e.g., sets 1's where expected is 0 in training 3).
    # Refine: only fill if left/right are identical non-1/non-0 AND gap size <= some limit (e.g., 2-3), and not if it creates strays.
    # Current version skips edges correctly but ignores gap size and over-applies when right==1.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] != 0:
            i += 1
            continue
        # ... (rest as in attempt, but add gap length check: if end-start+1 > 3, skip)
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely simple cases with clear strays or no fills needed, demonstrating basic row-wise 1-sequence detection and gap filling works for non-complex shapes.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated kept long runs of 1's in rows 1-5 (e.g., row1: [9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9] vs expected [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9]; row2: [0,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,0] vs [0,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,9,0]), indicating remove_stray_in_row did not trigger removal for 1-sequences bounded closely by 9's (left_sep <4 but right_open insufficient); fill_gaps_in_row then incorrectly added no extra 1's but failed to clean prior.
 * Bottom rows in training 3 unchanged and correct (e.g., row7-10 match expected), showing preservation of non-1 elements works.
 * No object extraction function yet, but row-wise processing is a good start; however, it's insufficient for vertical coherency (e.g., 1's connecting across rows not considered).
 * Function remove_stray_in_row is helpful but broken in logic (inverts remove conditions, e.g., sets remove=True only if left_sep>=4 or right_open>=3, but in training 3 it kept strays—possibly because left_non1 detection misses adjacent 9's).
 * Function fill_gaps_in_row is somewhat helpful for internal gaps but not relevant or over-applies in this puzzle (adds 1's where expected is empty space in shapes; don't use without heavy refinement or disable for stray-heavy cases).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of stray removal but misses subtlety of when 1's are "stray" vs. structural in shape outlines.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially cleans the top (e.g., row1: [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] removes some 1's correctly compared to input implication; row2-3 similar), but row4: [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5] keeps a 9-run that may be stray (input has 9's there, but expected likely 0's like in training 3 pattern); row5: [0,0,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,5] similarly retains 9's that should be removed if forming invalid extension.
 * Row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] keeps a single 1, which looks incorrect—expected probably [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5] if 1 is stray (isolated between 5's, but fill logic didn't trigger and remove didn't catch it).
 * Bottom rows (7-10) seem mostly preserved but row8: [3,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,1,5] keeps 1 (likely stray); row9-10 have 1's in [...,1,5] that should be removed to match pattern of cleaning fillers.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: It under-removes strays in mid-top (e.g., extra 9's/1's where expected 0's for shape outline) and fails to clean isolated 1's in lower rows, differing from training 3's expected clean empties; this suggests the program handles simple top strays but misses cases with mixed numbers (3's,5's) or short 1-runs. Unknown why 9's in row4-5 weren't treated as strays (perhaps code only targets 1's, not propagating to other fillers).

[2025-10-02 02:19:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:29:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a row-by-row processing puzzle on a 10x10 grid where cells contain numbers (0 for empty, 1 for fill, and >1 for colored supports or clues), and the goal is to fill in 1's between compatible supports based on proximity, color matching, and connection rules, while removing any unsupported groups of 1's to create a valid filled structure. The rules emphasize iterative filling and validation per row, likely simulating a logic puzzle like a filling or connection variant where supports propagate fills without overextending.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Fill 1's between same-color supports (>1) only if the gap between them (starting at least 2 cells apart) is entirely zeros; this "same color fill" rule bridges matching clues but skips if any non-zero intervenes.
 * "Connect fill" extends from a support (>1) across up to 3 consecutive zeros to reach an existing 1, filling those zeros with 1's; this is limited to prevent long unsupported chains and only triggers if it directly connects to a 1.
 * After filling, remove any group of consecutive 1's that lacks adjacency to a supporting cell (defined as 2-5); isolated or floating 1 groups are cleared to 0, ensuring all fills are justified by nearby supports.
 * Processing is strictly per row (no column or global interactions mentioned), and the grid is copied to avoid mutating input; iterations are over all 10 rows but apply rules independently per row.
 * Subtlety: Supports are hardcoded to {2,3,4,5}, ignoring higher numbers like 9 in the test input, which may treat them as non-supporting and prevent proper filling/validation.
 * Gap checks must be precise (e.g., start+2 minimum for same color, zeros <3 for connect), and group removal scans sequentially without revisiting, potentially missing edge cases in mixed rows.
 * No vertical propagation or multi-row rules are handled, which could be key if the puzzle involves 2D connectivity; also, no handling for diagonal or broader adjacency.
 * Iterative application per row might need multiple passes if fills create new opportunities, but the code does only one pass per row.
 * Easy to miss: 1's can act as connection points but are not supports themselves; removal only after both fill steps, so order matters.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helpful functions, types, or tools were defined in this attempt; the core logic is inline in the main function with manual loops for filling and removal. The supporting set {2,3,4,5} is useful but limited—consider generalizing to all >1 or input-specific.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core row-processing, same-color filling, connection extension, and unsupported group removal rules are correctly implemented for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Training examples 1-3 produced correct outputs, suggesting the logic handles basic same-color gaps, short connections to 1's, and support validation without issues in those grids.
 * What didn't work: The test input produced an output that appears incomplete or incorrect, with the first row entirely zeros (possibly unfilled due to no supports), partial fills in later rows (e.g., 9's not propagating as supports, leading to isolated 1's or missed connections), and a bottom-heavy structure that leaves upper rows sparse; this mismatches expected full propagation since input has 9's, 5's, and 3's which should fill more comprehensively if 9 were treated as supporting.
 * The hardcoded supporting set excludes 9 (common in test), causing 9-clue rows to not validate or propagate 1's properly, leading to under-filling.
 * Connect fill's 3-zero limit may be too restrictive for test gaps, resulting in unfilled sections (e.g., row 6 has a 1 but no extension).
 * Removal step clears some 1's correctly but may over-remove if supports like 9 are ignored, leaving artifacts like the single 1's in rows 6 and 8-10.
 * No extraction functions for objects/clues; manual scanning works for rows but could be error-prone—future attempts should include a clue finder (e.g., positions of >1 per row).
 * The same-color fill starts from every >1 and scans forward, which is efficient but misses backward fills or multi-clue interactions in dense rows.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of per-row iterative filling but fails on variable support values and potentially longer gaps in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal filling (e.g., row 0 all 0's, row 1 only two 9's with no fill, row 6 has a isolated 1 next to 5's but no broader connection), suggesting the rules under-applied, leaving most of the grid empty or partially filled compared to expected denser 1-propagation from the visible 3's, 5's, and 9's in input (inferred from output remnants).
 * Upper rows (0-2) are mostly unfilled despite potential 9-clue starts, differing from expectation that same-color or connect rules should bridge zeros; this indicates 9's not recognized as supports, preventing validation/removal issues.
 * Lower rows (7-9) have more 3's and 5's filled out, with trailing 1's and 5's, but the single 1's (e.g., positions 8 in rows 6,8-9) look like remnants of partial connects that weren't removed, which shouldn't persist if unsupported—expected to be cleared unless adjacent to valid supports.
 * The output creates a "staircase" of fills downward (e.g., 9's in row1-4, 5's building in row4-9, 3's in row7-9), but lacks cohesion; it makes sense as a partial application of the code's rules but not as a solved puzzle, as isolated 1's and unfilled gaps (e.g., row3 has 9's then 5 but no 1's between) violate likely full-connection intent.
 * No all-zero rows expected in a valid output; row0 all 0's is probably correct if input row0 is empty, but combined with sparse upper grid, it highlights failure to propagate from below or handle non-supporting 9's.
 * To handle test, must expand supporting set to include 9 (or all >1) and possibly increase connect zero limit or add backward scanning.

The goal appears to be cleaning up or simplifying the grid by removing stray or invalid groups of 1's (e.g., isolated or poorly connected segments) while preserving main shapes formed by other numbers, and possibly filling certain gaps under specific conditions, all processed row-by-row.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying and removing "stray" sequences of 1's in each row, but only if they are isolated (e.g., separated by 4+ zeros from non-0/non-1 elements on the left, or with insufficient open space on the right like <3 zeros).
 * Filling gaps between non-zero elements with 1's only if the gap is internal (not at edges), bounded by matching or specific values (e.g., same left/right values or right being 1), but this seems overly permissive and leads to incorrect fills in some cases.
 * Subtlety: Removals and fills are row-independent, but the overall effect should form coherent shapes across rows (e.g., in training example 3, the top forms a triangle of 9's with internal 0's, not filled 1's; bottom shapes like 4's and 2's remain intact).
 * Key consideration: 1's act as temporary fillers or connectors that should be removed if they don't belong to a valid structure (e.g., not part of a main object); avoid filling gaps indiscriminately, as this can incorrectly extend shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Edge cases like gaps at row starts/ends should not be filled; right-open space for removal decisions needs precise thresholding (e.g., >=3 zeros to justify keeping, but logic inverted in current code).
 * Across attempts: No column-wise processing, so vertical connections are ignored—may need holistic grid analysis; preserve non-1/non-0 elements exactly; 1's in bottom rows (e.g., with 2's, 4's) are sometimes valid and should not be removed.
 * No extraction of full objects yet; future attempts may need functions to detect blobs or connected components across rows/columns for better stray detection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def remove_stray_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Existing function is partially helpful for detecting sequences of 1's and basic isolation checks (left separation >=4 or right open >=3),
    # but buggy: it sometimes fails to remove valid strays (e.g., in training 3, keeps long 1-runs bounded by 9's) and inverts removal logic.
    # Use as base but fix conditions: always remove 1-sequences if left sep >=4 AND right open <3, or if fully isolated.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] == 1:
            start = i
            while i < 10 and new_row[i] == 1:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            # ... (rest as in attempt, but refine remove logic)
    return new_row
```

```python
def fill_gaps_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Partially helpful for gap detection, but overfills (e.g., sets 1's where expected is 0 in training 3).
    # Refine: only fill if left/right are identical non-1/non-0 AND gap size <= some limit (e.g., 2-3), and not if it creates strays.
    # Current version skips edges correctly but ignores gap size and over-applies when right==1.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] != 0:
            i += 1
            continue
        # ... (rest as in attempt, but add gap length check: if end-start+1 > 3, skip)
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely simple cases with clear strays or no fills needed, demonstrating basic row-wise 1-sequence detection and gap filling works for non-complex shapes.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated kept long runs of 1's in rows 1-5 (e.g., row1: [9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9] vs expected [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9]; row2: [0,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,0] vs [0,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,9,0]), indicating remove_stray_in_row did not trigger removal for 1-sequences bounded closely by 9's (left_sep <4 but right_open insufficient); fill_gaps_in_row then incorrectly added no extra 1's but failed to clean prior.
 * Bottom rows in training 3 unchanged and correct (e.g., row7-10 match expected), showing preservation of non-1 elements works.
 * No object extraction function yet, but row-wise processing is a good start; however, it's insufficient for vertical coherency (e.g., 1's connecting across rows not considered).
 * Function remove_stray_in_row is helpful but broken in logic (inverts remove conditions, e.g., sets remove=True only if left_sep>=4 or right_open>=3, but in training 3 it kept strays—possibly because left_non1 detection misses adjacent 9's).
 * Function fill_gaps_in_row is somewhat helpful for internal gaps but not relevant or over-applies in this puzzle (adds 1's where expected is empty space in shapes; don't use without heavy refinement or disable for stray-heavy cases).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of stray removal but misses subtlety of when 1's are "stray" vs. structural in shape outlines.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially cleans the top (e.g., row1: [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] removes some 1's correctly compared to input implication; row2-3 similar), but row4: [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5] keeps a 9-run that may be stray (input has 9's there, but expected likely 0's like in training 3 pattern); row5: [0,0,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,5] similarly retains 9's that should be removed if forming invalid extension.
 * Row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] keeps a single 1, which looks incorrect—expected probably [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5] if 1 is stray (isolated between 5's, but fill logic didn't trigger and remove didn't catch it).
 * Bottom rows (7-10) seem mostly preserved but row8: [3,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,1,5] keeps 1 (likely stray); row9-10 have 1's in [...,1,5] that should be removed to match pattern of cleaning fillers.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: It under-removes strays in mid-top (e.g., extra 9's/1's where expected 0's for shape outline) and fails to clean isolated 1's in lower rows, differing from training 3's expected clean empties; this suggests the program handles simple top strays but misses cases with mixed numbers (3's,5's) or short 1-runs. Unknown why 9's in row4-5 weren't treated as strays (perhaps code only targets 1's, not propagating to other fillers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a row-by-row processing puzzle on a 10x10 grid where cells contain numbers (0 for empty, 1 for fill, and >1 for colored supports or clues), and the goal is to fill in 1's between compatible supports based on proximity, color matching, and connection rules, while removing any unsupported groups of 1's to create a valid filled structure. The rules emphasize iterative filling and validation per row, likely simulating a logic puzzle like a filling or connection variant where supports propagate fills without overextending.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Fill 1's between same-color supports (>1) only if the gap between them (starting at least 2 cells apart) is entirely zeros; this "same color fill" rule bridges matching clues but skips if any non-zero intervenes.
 * "Connect fill" extends from a support (>1) across up to 3 consecutive zeros to reach an existing 1, filling those zeros with 1's; this is limited to prevent long unsupported chains and only triggers if it directly connects to a 1.
 * After filling, remove any group of consecutive 1's that lacks adjacency to a supporting cell (defined as 2-5); isolated or floating 1 groups are cleared to 0, ensuring all fills are justified by nearby supports.
 * Processing is strictly per row (no column or global interactions mentioned), and the grid is copied to avoid mutating input; iterations are over all 10 rows but apply rules independently per row.
 * Subtlety: Supports are hardcoded to {2,3,4,5}, ignoring higher numbers like 9 in the test input, which may treat them as non-supporting and prevent proper filling/validation.
 * Gap checks must be precise (e.g., start+2 minimum for same color, zeros <3 for connect), and group removal scans sequentially without revisiting, potentially missing edge cases in mixed rows.
 * No vertical propagation or multi-row rules are handled, which could be key if the puzzle involves 2D connectivity; also, no handling for diagonal or broader adjacency.
 * Iterative application per row might need multiple passes if fills create new opportunities, but the code does only one pass per row.
 * Easy to miss: 1's can act as connection points but are not supports themselves; removal only after both fill steps, so order matters.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helpful functions, types, or tools were defined in this attempt; the core logic is inline in the main function with manual loops for filling and removal. The supporting set {2,3,4,5} is useful but limited—consider generalizing to all >1 or input-specific.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core row-processing, same-color filling, connection extension, and unsupported group removal rules are correctly implemented for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Training examples 1-3 produced correct outputs, suggesting the logic handles basic same-color gaps, short connections to 1's, and support validation without issues in those grids.
 * What didn't work: The test input produced an output that appears incomplete or incorrect, with the first row entirely zeros (possibly unfilled due to no supports), partial fills in later rows (e.g., 9's not propagating as supports, leading to isolated 1's or missed connections), and a bottom-heavy structure that leaves upper rows sparse; this mismatches expected full propagation since input has 9's, 5's, and 3's which should fill more comprehensively if 9 were treated as supporting.
 * The hardcoded supporting set excludes 9 (common in test), causing 9-clue rows to not validate or propagate 1's properly, leading to under-filling.
 * Connect fill's 3-zero limit may be too restrictive for test gaps, resulting in unfilled sections (e.g., row 6 has a 1 but no extension).
 * Removal step clears some 1's correctly but may over-remove if supports like 9 are ignored, leaving artifacts like the single 1's in rows 6 and 8-10.
 * No extraction functions for objects/clues; manual scanning works for rows but could be error-prone—future attempts should include a clue finder (e.g., positions of >1 per row).
 * The same-color fill starts from every >1 and scans forward, which is efficient but misses backward fills or multi-clue interactions in dense rows.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of per-row iterative filling but fails on variable support values and potentially longer gaps in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal filling (e.g., row 0 all 0's, row 1 only two 9's with no fill, row 6 has a isolated 1 next to 5's but no broader connection), suggesting the rules under-applied, leaving most of the grid empty or partially filled compared to expected denser 1-propagation from the visible 3's, 5's, and 9's in input (inferred from output remnants).
 * Upper rows (0-2) are mostly unfilled despite potential 9-clue starts, differing from expectation that same-color or connect rules should bridge zeros; this indicates 9's not recognized as supports, preventing validation/removal issues.
 * Lower rows (7-9) have more 3's and 5's filled out, with trailing 1's and 5's, but the single 1's (e.g., positions 8 in rows 6,8-9) look like remnants of partial connects that weren't removed, which shouldn't persist if unsupported—expected to be cleared unless adjacent to valid supports.
 * The output creates a "staircase" of fills downward (e.g., 9's in row1-4, 5's building in row4-9, 3's in row7-9), but lacks cohesion; it makes sense as a partial application of the code's rules but not as a solved puzzle, as isolated 1's and unfilled gaps (e.g., row3 has 9's then 5 but no 1's between) violate likely full-connection intent.
 * No all-zero rows expected in a valid output; row0 all 0's is probably correct if input row0 is empty, but combined with sparse upper grid, it highlights failure to propagate from below or handle non-supporting 9's.
 * To handle test, must expand supporting set to include 9 (or all >1) and possibly increase connect zero limit or add backward scanning.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:42:15] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram or support-based fill puzzle) on a 10x10 grid where cells are 0 (empty), 1 (fillable/connectable cells), or >1 (colored support blocks, e.g., 2-9 representing different colors or types). The goal is to apply rules to fill gaps with 1s based on proximity to supports, connect existing 1s to supports across limited empty spaces, and remove unsupported 1s, propagating these changes row-by-row to create a coherent filled structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Supports are numbers >1; low supports {2,3,4,5} are used for validating/removing stray 1s, but higher numbers like 9 and 5 appear in the test and seem to act as valid supports for filling/connecting, suggesting all >1 might support but only low ones prevent stray removal—subtle mismatch in code scope.
 * Gap filling for same color: Fill 1s in gaps of 1-3 zeros between identical colors (>1), but only if the gap is bounded by the same color on both sides; this extends color blocks indirectly via 1s.
 * Gap filling for different colors: Similar to same-color but only if gap 1-3 zeros, colors are both odd (e.g., 3 and 5, 9 and 5), and different; fills with 1s but doesn't extend the second color's scan properly in code (i increments past but doesn't adjust for it).
 * Connecting supports to 1s: From a support (>1), extend rightward (or leftward in backward pass) across up to 3 zeros to reach an existing 1, filling those zeros with 1s; this creates bridges but doesn't propagate further (e.g., no chaining multiple connections).
 * Removing stray 1s: Groups of consecutive 1s are removed (set to 0) if not adjacent (left or right) to a low support {2,3,4,5}; higher supports like 9 don't count for this, which might leave unsupported 1s in test cases.
 * Row-by-row processing order matters: Functions are applied sequentially per row (same-gap, diff-gap, connect forward, connect backward, remove strays), but no inter-row propagation (e.g., no vertical filling or alignment), assuming the puzzle is strictly horizontal per row.
 * Max gap/zeros=3 is hardcoded; might need tuning if puzzle varies, but consistent for training.
 * Subtle: In fill functions, after filling a gap with 1s, the loop continues scanning from the end of the second color block, but filled 1s aren't treated as supports, so no recursive filling in one pass—multiple iterations per row might be needed but aren't implemented.
 * Existing 1s in input (e.g., test has some 1s) act as anchors for connections but can be removed if stray.
 * Puzzle likely expects a "stable" final grid where all 1s are justified by proximity to supports, avoiding over-filling or under-filling sparse areas.
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, but it might help identify full structures like vertical stacks of colors (e.g., 9s and 5s in test seem stacked but not vertically connected in rules).
 * Easy to miss: Odd/even parity for different-color fills (only odd-odd pairs); code checks c %2 ==1 and new_row[i]%2==1, but even supports like 2,4 might not bridge odds.
 * No handling for single-cell supports or edge cases (e.g., gaps at row ends); loops handle i<10 but may skip if gap overflows.

The provided functions are mostly helpful but have bugs/subtleties noted below; no custom types or extraction tools are present, but a blob extractor could help analyze connected >1 regions vertically/horizontally for better support detection.

```python
def fill_same_color_gaps(row: List[int], max_gap: int) -> List[int]:
    # Helpful for extending same-color blocks via 1s in small gaps; works as core rule but assumes non-overlapping scans.
    # Bug: Fills with 1s, but if gap fill creates new "support" adjacency, it doesn't re-scan in same pass.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] > 1:
            c = new_row[i]
            while i < 10 and new_row[i] == c:

            gap_start = i
            gap_size = 0

            if 1 <= gap_size <= max_gap and i < 10 and new_row[i] == c:
                for k in range(gap_start, i):
                    new_row[k] = 1
                while i < 10 and new_row[i] == c:
                    i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def connect_support_to_ones(row: List[int], max_zeros: int) -> List[int]:
    # Helpful for bridging supports to existing 1s; forward direction catches rightward extensions.
    # Subtle: Only connects to 1s, not to other supports; doesn't chain (e.g., support-zero-zero-1-zero-support not fully bridged).
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] > 1:
            j = i + 1

            while j < 10 and count < max_zeros and new_row[j] == 0:
                count += 1
                j += 1
            if count > 0 and j < 10 and new_row[j] == 1:

    return new_row
```

```python
def remove_stray_ones(row: List[int], supports: set) -> List[int]:
    # Essential cleanup to enforce "supported" 1s; correctly groups consecutive 1s and checks adjacency.
    # Issue: Limited to low_supports {2,3,4,5}; higher like 9/5 in test should probably count, leading to premature removals.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] == 1:
            start = i
            while i < 10 and new_row[i] == 1:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            has_support = False
            if start > 0 and new_row[start - 1] in supports:
                has_support = True
            if end < 9 and new_row[end + 1] in supports:
                has_support = True
            if not has_support:
                for k in range(start, end + 1):

        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

The other functions (fill_different_color_gaps, connect_support_to_ones_backward) are similar but less robust: fill_different has a bug in i-increment after filling (skips second color block without re-adjusting), and backward connect is helpful for leftward but redundant if forward+backward cover all; include if directionality matters.

No extraction functions provided; a helpful one might be:

```python
def extract_color_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple]] :  # Returns list of (row, col_start, col_end, color) for >1 blobs
    blobs = []
    for r in range(10):
        c = 0
        while c < 10:
            if g[r][c] > 1:
                color = g[r][c]
                start = c
                while c < 10 and g[r][c] == color:
                    c += 1
                blobs.append((r, start, c-1, color))
            else:
                c += 1
    return blobs  # Could extend to vertical blobs for inter-row rules if needed
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; training examples 1-3 all correct, showing core rules (gap filling, connecting, stray removal) work for simple cases like isolated supports with small gaps or existing 1s.
 * What worked: Sequential row processing correctly propagates fills in training (e.g., likely filled gaps in same/diff colors and connected without over-removing).
 * What didn't work: Limited propagation—no iteration loops mean fills/connections don't chain (e.g., a new 1 from one rule doesn't enable further connections in same row); backward connect scans from end but may miss if forward already filled.
 * fill_different_color_gaps is buggy: After filling, it sets c2 and increments i past the second block, but doesn't adjust for potential new gaps created by 1s; also, condition c %2==1 and new_row[i]%2==1 is too restrictive if evens can bridge in some cases (unknown if needed).
 * connect functions only bridge to 1s, not to other supports, missing potential support-to-support fills via 1s.
 * remove_stray_ones too narrow (only {2,3,4,5}); higher colors like 9/5 in test act as supports for filling but not for retention, possibly removing valid 1s.
 * No vertical considerations: Puzzle may imply vertical alignment (e.g., stacked 9s and 5s in test columns), but code is purely horizontal, missing cross-row supports.
 * Overall, attempt understands horizontal filling but under-fills complex propagations; no object extraction means no global structure awareness (e.g., identifying full color regions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows sparse filling: Row 0 all 0s (expected if no supports/1s in input); rows 1-2 have partial 9s but no fills; rows 3-9 have some 9s/5s/3s and limited 1s (e.g., row 4 has two 1s next to 5, row 8-9 have 1s adjacent to 5s), suggesting connections happened but minimally.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected more propagation, e.g., column 9 has stacked 5s from row 3-9 with some 1s, but gaps like row 1-2 column 9 are 0 (input likely had 0s there), and no fills bridge them—code's max_gap=3 should fill if odd-odd (9 odd? Wait, 9>1 odd, but row1 [9,9,0...] doesn't connect downward). Row 7 has 1 next to 5, but earlier rows' 1s (row4-6) might be strays if not low-supported, yet persist, indicating remove_stray_ones didn't trigger or supports like 5 count partially.
 * Missing fills: E.g., row 3 [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5] has 9s and distant 5 (odd-odd), gap>3 zeros so no fill, but if vertical stacking implies connection, output ignores it (all horizontal). Row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] has 1 between 5s (same color, gap=0? but already 1), correct, but no extension leftward.
 * Differences from expected: Expected denser 1s bridging the 9-stack (cols 1-4 rows1-5) to 5-stack (col9 rows3-9) and 3-stack (cols0-3 rows6-9), perhaps filling horizontal gaps with 1s if <3 zeros, but output has large 0 regions (e.g., row4 cols0-3 all 0 despite nearby 9s/5s). Unknown if input had more 1s/seeds, but output seems under-filled compared to a "complete" structure; first row all 0s makes sense if empty, but overall grid looks incomplete (e.g., no 1s in row1-3 despite supports).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 02:42:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 10x10 grid where numbers represent colors or elements (e.g., 0 as empty, 1 as a filler like white or connector, and higher numbers like 9, 4, 5 as distinct objects or shapes). The goal appears to be cleaning up or simplifying the grid by removing stray or invalid groups of 1's (e.g., isolated or poorly connected segments) while preserving main shapes formed by other numbers, and possibly filling certain gaps under specific conditions, all processed row-by-row.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying and removing "stray" sequences of 1's in each row, but only if they are isolated (e.g., separated by 4+ zeros from non-0/non-1 elements on the left, or with insufficient open space on the right like <3 zeros).
 * Filling gaps between non-zero elements with 1's only if the gap is internal (not at edges), bounded by matching or specific values (e.g., same left/right values or right being 1), but this seems overly permissive and leads to incorrect fills in some cases.
 * Subtlety: Removals and fills are row-independent, but the overall effect should form coherent shapes across rows (e.g., in training example 3, the top forms a triangle of 9's with internal 0's, not filled 1's; bottom shapes like 4's and 2's remain intact).
 * Key consideration: 1's act as temporary fillers or connectors that should be removed if they don't belong to a valid structure (e.g., not part of a main object); avoid filling gaps indiscriminately, as this can incorrectly extend shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Edge cases like gaps at row starts/ends should not be filled; right-open space for removal decisions needs precise thresholding (e.g., >=3 zeros to justify keeping, but logic inverted in current code).
 * Across attempts: No column-wise processing, so vertical connections are ignored—may need holistic grid analysis; preserve non-1/non-0 elements exactly; 1's in bottom rows (e.g., with 2's, 4's) are sometimes valid and should not be removed.
 * No extraction of full objects yet; future attempts may need functions to detect blobs or connected components across rows/columns for better stray detection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def remove_stray_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Existing function is partially helpful for detecting sequences of 1's and basic isolation checks (left separation >=4 or right open >=3),
    # but buggy: it sometimes fails to remove valid strays (e.g., in training 3, keeps long 1-runs bounded by 9's) and inverts removal logic.
    # Use as base but fix conditions: always remove 1-sequences if left sep >=4 AND right open <3, or if fully isolated.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] == 1:
            start = i
            while i < 10 and new_row[i] == 1:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            # ... (rest as in attempt, but refine remove logic)
    return new_row
```

```python
def fill_gaps_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Partially helpful for gap detection, but overfills (e.g., sets 1's where expected is 0 in training 3).
    # Refine: only fill if left/right are identical non-1/non-0 AND gap size <= some limit (e.g., 2-3), and not if it creates strays.
    # Current version skips edges correctly but ignores gap size and over-applies when right==1.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] != 0:
            i += 1
            continue
        # ... (rest as in attempt, but add gap length check: if end-start+1 > 3, skip)
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely simple cases with clear strays or no fills needed, demonstrating basic row-wise 1-sequence detection and gap filling works for non-complex shapes.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated kept long runs of 1's in rows 1-5 (e.g., row1: [9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9] vs expected [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9]; row2: [0,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,0] vs [0,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,9,0]), indicating remove_stray_in_row did not trigger removal for 1-sequences bounded closely by 9's (left_sep <4 but right_open insufficient); fill_gaps_in_row then incorrectly added no extra 1's but failed to clean prior.
 * Bottom rows in training 3 unchanged and correct (e.g., row7-10 match expected), showing preservation of non-1 elements works.
 * No object extraction function yet, but row-wise processing is a good start; however, it's insufficient for vertical coherency (e.g., 1's connecting across rows not considered).
 * Function remove_stray_in_row is helpful but broken in logic (inverts remove conditions, e.g., sets remove=True only if left_sep>=4 or right_open>=3, but in training 3 it kept strays—possibly because left_non1 detection misses adjacent 9's).
 * Function fill_gaps_in_row is somewhat helpful for internal gaps but not relevant or over-applies in this puzzle (adds 1's where expected is empty space in shapes; don't use without heavy refinement or disable for stray-heavy cases).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of stray removal but misses subtlety of when 1's are "stray" vs. structural in shape outlines.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially cleans the top (e.g., row1: [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] removes some 1's correctly compared to input implication; row2-3 similar), but row4: [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5] keeps a 9-run that may be stray (input has 9's there, but expected likely 0's like in training 3 pattern); row5: [0,0,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,5] similarly retains 9's that should be removed if forming invalid extension.
 * Row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] keeps a single 1, which looks incorrect—expected probably [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5] if 1 is stray (isolated between 5's, but fill logic didn't trigger and remove didn't catch it).
 * Bottom rows (7-10) seem mostly preserved but row8: [3,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,1,5] keeps 1 (likely stray); row9-10 have 1's in [...,1,5] that should be removed to match pattern of cleaning fillers.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: It under-removes strays in mid-top (e.g., extra 9's/1's where expected 0's for shape outline) and fails to clean isolated 1's in lower rows, differing from training 3's expected clean empties; this suggests the program handles simple top strays but misses cases with mixed numbers (3's,5's) or short 1-runs. Unknown why 9's in row4-5 weren't treated as strays (perhaps code only targets 1's, not propagating to other fillers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a row-by-row processing puzzle on a 10x10 grid where cells contain numbers (0 for empty, 1 for fill, and >1 for colored supports or clues), and the goal is to fill in 1's between compatible supports based on proximity, color matching, and connection rules, while removing any unsupported groups of 1's to create a valid filled structure. The rules emphasize iterative filling and validation per row, likely simulating a logic puzzle like a filling or connection variant where supports propagate fills without overextending.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Fill 1's between same-color supports (>1) only if the gap between them (starting at least 2 cells apart) is entirely zeros; this "same color fill" rule bridges matching clues but skips if any non-zero intervenes.
 * "Connect fill" extends from a support (>1) across up to 3 consecutive zeros to reach an existing 1, filling those zeros with 1's; this is limited to prevent long unsupported chains and only triggers if it directly connects to a 1.
 * After filling, remove any group of consecutive 1's that lacks adjacency to a supporting cell (defined as 2-5); isolated or floating 1 groups are cleared to 0, ensuring all fills are justified by nearby supports.
 * Processing is strictly per row (no column or global interactions mentioned), and the grid is copied to avoid mutating input; iterations are over all 10 rows but apply rules independently per row.
 * Subtlety: Supports are hardcoded to {2,3,4,5}, ignoring higher numbers like 9 in the test input, which may treat them as non-supporting and prevent proper filling/validation.
 * Gap checks must be precise (e.g., start+2 minimum for same color, zeros <3 for connect), and group removal scans sequentially without revisiting, potentially missing edge cases in mixed rows.
 * No vertical propagation or multi-row rules are handled, which could be key if the puzzle involves 2D connectivity; also, no handling for diagonal or broader adjacency.
 * Iterative application per row might need multiple passes if fills create new opportunities, but the code does only one pass per row.
 * Easy to miss: 1's can act as connection points but are not supports themselves; removal only after both fill steps, so order matters.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helpful functions, types, or tools were defined in this attempt; the core logic is inline in the main function with manual loops for filling and removal. The supporting set {2,3,4,5} is useful but limited—consider generalizing to all >1 or input-specific.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core row-processing, same-color filling, connection extension, and unsupported group removal rules are correctly implemented for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Training examples 1-3 produced correct outputs, suggesting the logic handles basic same-color gaps, short connections to 1's, and support validation without issues in those grids.
 * What didn't work: The test input produced an output that appears incomplete or incorrect, with the first row entirely zeros (possibly unfilled due to no supports), partial fills in later rows (e.g., 9's not propagating as supports, leading to isolated 1's or missed connections), and a bottom-heavy structure that leaves upper rows sparse; this mismatches expected full propagation since input has 9's, 5's, and 3's which should fill more comprehensively if 9 were treated as supporting.
 * The hardcoded supporting set excludes 9 (common in test), causing 9-clue rows to not validate or propagate 1's properly, leading to under-filling.
 * Connect fill's 3-zero limit may be too restrictive for test gaps, resulting in unfilled sections (e.g., row 6 has a 1 but no extension).
 * Removal step clears some 1's correctly but may over-remove if supports like 9 are ignored, leaving artifacts like the single 1's in rows 6 and 8-10.
 * No extraction functions for objects/clues; manual scanning works for rows but could be error-prone—future attempts should include a clue finder (e.g., positions of >1 per row).
 * The same-color fill starts from every >1 and scans forward, which is efficient but misses backward fills or multi-clue interactions in dense rows.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of per-row iterative filling but fails on variable support values and potentially longer gaps in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal filling (e.g., row 0 all 0's, row 1 only two 9's with no fill, row 6 has a isolated 1 next to 5's but no broader connection), suggesting the rules under-applied, leaving most of the grid empty or partially filled compared to expected denser 1-propagation from the visible 3's, 5's, and 9's in input (inferred from output remnants).
 * Upper rows (0-2) are mostly unfilled despite potential 9-clue starts, differing from expectation that same-color or connect rules should bridge zeros; this indicates 9's not recognized as supports, preventing validation/removal issues.
 * Lower rows (7-9) have more 3's and 5's filled out, with trailing 1's and 5's, but the single 1's (e.g., positions 8 in rows 6,8-9) look like remnants of partial connects that weren't removed, which shouldn't persist if unsupported—expected to be cleared unless adjacent to valid supports.
 * The output creates a "staircase" of fills downward (e.g., 9's in row1-4, 5's building in row4-9, 3's in row7-9), but lacks cohesion; it makes sense as a partial application of the code's rules but not as a solved puzzle, as isolated 1's and unfilled gaps (e.g., row3 has 9's then 5 but no 1's between) violate likely full-connection intent.
 * No all-zero rows expected in a valid output; row0 all 0's is probably correct if input row0 is empty, but combined with sparse upper grid, it highlights failure to propagate from below or handle non-supporting 9's.
 * To handle test, must expand supporting set to include 9 (or all >1) and possibly increase connect zero limit or add backward scanning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram or support-based fill puzzle) on a 10x10 grid where cells are 0 (empty), 1 (fillable/connectable cells), or >1 (colored support blocks, e.g., 2-9 representing different colors or types). The goal is to apply rules to fill gaps with 1s based on proximity to supports, connect existing 1s to supports across limited empty spaces, and remove unsupported 1s, propagating these changes row-by-row to create a coherent filled structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Supports are numbers >1; low supports {2,3,4,5} are used for validating/removing stray 1s, but higher numbers like 9 and 5 appear in the test and seem to act as valid supports for filling/connecting, suggesting all >1 might support but only low ones prevent stray removal—subtle mismatch in code scope.
 * Gap filling for same color: Fill 1s in gaps of 1-3 zeros between identical colors (>1), but only if the gap is bounded by the same color on both sides; this extends color blocks indirectly via 1s.
 * Gap filling for different colors: Similar to same-color but only if gap 1-3 zeros, colors are both odd (e.g., 3 and 5, 9 and 5), and different; fills with 1s but doesn't extend the second color's scan properly in code (i increments past but doesn't adjust for it).
 * Connecting supports to 1s: From a support (>1), extend rightward (or leftward in backward pass) across up to 3 zeros to reach an existing 1, filling those zeros with 1s; this creates bridges but doesn't propagate further (e.g., no chaining multiple connections).
 * Removing stray 1s: Groups of consecutive 1s are removed (set to 0) if not adjacent (left or right) to a low support {2,3,4,5}; higher supports like 9 don't count for this, which might leave unsupported 1s in test cases.
 * Row-by-row processing order matters: Functions are applied sequentially per row (same-gap, diff-gap, connect forward, connect backward, remove strays), but no inter-row propagation (e.g., no vertical filling or alignment), assuming the puzzle is strictly horizontal per row.
 * Max gap/zeros=3 is hardcoded; might need tuning if puzzle varies, but consistent for training.
 * Subtle: In fill functions, after filling a gap with 1s, the loop continues scanning from the end of the second color block, but filled 1s aren't treated as supports, so no recursive filling in one pass—multiple iterations per row might be needed but aren't implemented.
 * Existing 1s in input (e.g., test has some 1s) act as anchors for connections but can be removed if stray.
 * Puzzle likely expects a "stable" final grid where all 1s are justified by proximity to supports, avoiding over-filling or under-filling sparse areas.
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, but it might help identify full structures like vertical stacks of colors (e.g., 9s and 5s in test seem stacked but not vertically connected in rules).
 * Easy to miss: Odd/even parity for different-color fills (only odd-odd pairs); code checks c %2 ==1 and new_row[i]%2==1, but even supports like 2,4 might not bridge odds.
 * No handling for single-cell supports or edge cases (e.g., gaps at row ends); loops handle i<10 but may skip if gap overflows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions are mostly helpful but have bugs/subtleties noted below; no custom types or extraction tools are present, but a blob extractor could help analyze connected >1 regions vertically/horizontally for better support detection.

```

The other functions (fill_different_color_gaps, connect_support_to_ones_backward) are similar but less robust: fill_different has a bug in i-increment after filling (skips second color block without re-adjusting), and backward connect is helpful for leftward but redundant if forward+backward cover all; include if directionality matters.

No extraction functions provided; a helpful one might be:

```python
def extract_color_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple]] :  # Returns list of (row, col_start, col_end, color) for >1 blobs
    blobs = []
    for r in range(10):
        c = 0
        while c < 10:
            if g[r][c] > 1:
                color = g[r][c]
                start = c
                while c < 10 and g[r][c] == color:
                    c += 1
                blobs.append((r, start, c-1, color))
            else:
                c += 1
    return blobs  # Could extend to vertical blobs for inter-row rules if needed
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; training examples 1-3 all correct, showing core rules (gap filling, connecting, stray removal) work for simple cases like isolated supports with small gaps or existing 1s.
 * What worked: Sequential row processing correctly propagates fills in training (e.g., likely filled gaps in same/diff colors and connected without over-removing).
 * What didn't work: Limited propagation—no iteration loops mean fills/connections don't chain (e.g., a new 1 from one rule doesn't enable further connections in same row); backward connect scans from end but may miss if forward already filled.
 * fill_different_color_gaps is buggy: After filling, it sets c2 and increments i past the second block, but doesn't adjust for potential new gaps created by 1s; also, condition c %2==1 and new_row[i]%2==1 is too restrictive if evens can bridge in some cases (unknown if needed).
 * connect functions only bridge to 1s, not to other supports, missing potential support-to-support fills via 1s.
 * remove_stray_ones too narrow (only {2,3,4,5}); higher colors like 9/5 in test act as supports for filling but not for retention, possibly removing valid 1s.
 * No vertical considerations: Puzzle may imply vertical alignment (e.g., stacked 9s and 5s in test columns), but code is purely horizontal, missing cross-row supports.
 * Overall, attempt understands horizontal filling but under-fills complex propagations; no object extraction means no global structure awareness (e.g., identifying full color regions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows sparse filling: Row 0 all 0s (expected if no supports/1s in input); rows 1-2 have partial 9s but no fills; rows 3-9 have some 9s/5s/3s and limited 1s (e.g., row 4 has two 1s next to 5, row 8-9 have 1s adjacent to 5s), suggesting connections happened but minimally.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected more propagation, e.g., column 9 has stacked 5s from row 3-9 with some 1s, but gaps like row 1-2 column 9 are 0 (input likely had 0s there), and no fills bridge them—code's max_gap=3 should fill if odd-odd (9 odd? Wait, 9>1 odd, but row1 [9,9,0...] doesn't connect downward). Row 7 has 1 next to 5, but earlier rows' 1s (row4-6) might be strays if not low-supported, yet persist, indicating remove_stray_ones didn't trigger or supports like 5 count partially.
 * Missing fills: E.g., row 3 [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5] has 9s and distant 5 (odd-odd), gap>3 zeros so no fill, but if vertical stacking implies connection, output ignores it (all horizontal). Row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] has 1 between 5s (same color, gap=0? but already 1), correct, but no extension leftward.
 * Differences from expected: Expected denser 1s bridging the 9-stack (cols 1-4 rows1-5) to 5-stack (col9 rows3-9) and 3-stack (cols0-3 rows6-9), perhaps filling horizontal gaps with 1s if <3 zeros, but output has large 0 regions (e.g., row4 cols0-3 all 0 despite nearby 9s/5s). Unknown if input had more 1s/seeds, but output seems under-filled compared to a "complete" structure; first row all 0s makes sense if empty, but overall grid looks incomplete (e.g., no 1s in row1-3 despite supports).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:53:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid where colored blocks (numbers >1, likely representing different colors or types) need to be connected or extended via support structures (1's filling gaps), following rules for gap sizes, color parity, and support validity, while removing unsupported 1's to form coherent structures across rows. The goal is to process each row independently but consistently to reveal or complete the underlying puzzle image or pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include filling gaps (0's) between same-color blocks if the gap is 1-3 cells wide (max_gap=3), effectively extending the color block.
 * For different colors, gaps can be filled with 1's only if both colors are odd-numbered (e.g., 3 and 5, but not 2 and 3), and the gap is 1-3 wide; this seems to allow bridging between compatible (odd) colors.
 * Supports (1's) can connect to existing 1's by filling up to 3 consecutive 0's forward or backward from a color block (>1), but only if it reaches another 1.
 * Stray 1's (isolated groups of 1's) must be removed if not adjacent to a valid support color (defined as {2,3,4,5}); note that higher numbers like 9 are treated as colors but not as supports for validating 1's, which may lead to incomplete structures.
 * Processing is row-by-row and sequential (fill same, then different, then connect forward/backward, then remove strays), which can create cascading effects but risks over-filling or missing vertical alignments if rows aren't considered interdependently.
 * Subtle elements: Gaps are only filled if bounded by the same color on both sides for same-color fills; different-color fills require odd parity and skip even colors; connections to 1's are directional (forward/backward separately) and limited to max_zeros=3, potentially missing longer chains; the grid may have vertical continuity (e.g., colors stacking like in a nonogram or blob puzzle), so row-wise processing might ignore column-wise support.
 * Easy-to-miss: Colors like 9 (odd but not in supports) can initiate fills but can't validate adjacent 1's, leading to removals; all-zero rows remain empty unless connected; the program assumes 10-column fixed width and doesn't handle edge cases like gaps at row ends.
 * Considerations across attempts: No extraction of multi-row objects (e.g., vertical blobs or connected components across rows/columns), which might be needed for global structure; no validation against a "key" or expected pattern; functions don't account for color-specific rules (e.g., 9 might be a special "high" color not bridgeable); potential over-removal of 1's if supports are narrowly defined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new types or tools introduced; the existing row-processing functions (fill_same_color_gaps, fill_different_color_gaps, connect_support_to_ones, connect_support_to_ones_backward, remove_stray_ones) are helpful for linear gap filling and cleanup but are row-only and lack vertical integration. For future, a function to extract vertical objects (e.g., connected components) would help:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

class VerticalBlob:
    def __init__(self):
        self.color = 0
        self.positions: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []  # (row, col) spans
        self.gap_sizes = []

def extract_vertical_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[VerticalBlob]:
    blobs = []
    visited = [[False] * 10 for _ in range(10)]
    for col in range(10):
        for row in range(10):
            if g[row][col] > 0 and not visited[row][col]:
                blob = VerticalBlob()
                blob.color = g[row][col]
                # BFS or DFS to collect connected same-color cells vertically/horizontally
                stack = [(row, col)]
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    if visited[r][c]:
                        continue
                    visited[r][c] = True
                    blob.positions.append((r, c))
                    # Add neighbors (up, down, left, right) if same color
                    for dr, dc in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < 10 and 0 <= nc < 10 and g[nr][nc] == blob.color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if len(blob.positions) > 1:  # Only multi-cell blobs
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly handled training examples 1-3, successfully filling gaps, connecting supports, and removing strays to match expected outputs, demonstrating understanding of row-wise gap filling for same/different colors and basic support validation.
 * Missed handling of non-support colors like 9, which initiates fills but can't anchor 1's, leading to potential removals in remove_stray_ones.
 * Connect_support_to_ones and connect_support_to_ones_backward worked for short gaps in training but may not chain multiple connections or handle vertical influences.
 * Fill_different_color_gaps is helpful but overly restrictive (only odd-odd pairs), which might miss even-odd bridges if rules allow them.
 * Remove_stray_ones is essential for cleanup but broken for colors outside {2,3,4,5} (e.g., 9), causing valid 1's near 9's to be erroneously removed.
 * No previous attempts shown beyond this one; however, the program lacks global considerations like vertical connectivity, which could explain training success (simple row patterns) but test failure (stacked colors like 9's over 3's/5's).
 * Fill_same_color_gaps is correct and relevant, handling intra-color extensions well.
 * The sequential order (same -> different -> connect -> remove) is helpful but may propagate errors if earlier fills create invalid strays.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows minimal filling (e.g., first row remains all 0's, indicating no connections initiated), with 9's in upper rows barely extended and lower rows having isolated 3's, 5's, and 1's that don't form coherent vertical structures.
 * Expected output likely involves more 1's bridging the 9's downward to the 3's and 5's (e.g., filling gaps in columns 0-2 for 9-to-3, or column 9 for 5's), and possibly extending 5's horizontally/vertically, but the generated output leaves large zero areas (e.g., rows 1-2 have trailing 0's, row 4 has unfilled 0's before 9's).
 * The 1's in lower rows (e.g., row 4: positions 7-8; row 5: position 8) appear as partial supports but are likely strays near 5's, and without proper anchoring (since 9 isn't a support), they may have been added then not removed correctly, differing from expectation of full vertical chains.
 * Upper 9's (rows 1-4) should probably connect via 1's to lower 3's/5's given odd parity (9 and 3/5 are odd), but output shows no such bridging, leaving disconnected blobs—unknown why fill_different_color_gaps didn't trigger, possibly due to gap sizes >3 vertically or row-only processing.
 * Bottom row has 3's extended left but abrupt shift to 5's with 1's at end, which doesn't match a clean structure; expected more uniform filling or removal of the trailing 1 if unsupported.
 * Overall, the output is too sparse and disconnected compared to what puzzle rules suggest (coherent colored regions with supports), indicating the program fails on multi-row, high-color (9) cases.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 02:53:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 10x10 grid where numbers represent colors or elements (e.g., 0 as empty, 1 as a filler like white or connector, and higher numbers like 9, 4, 5 as distinct objects or shapes). The goal appears to be cleaning up or simplifying the grid by removing stray or invalid groups of 1's (e.g., isolated or poorly connected segments) while preserving main shapes formed by other numbers, and possibly filling certain gaps under specific conditions, all processed row-by-row.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying and removing "stray" sequences of 1's in each row, but only if they are isolated (e.g., separated by 4+ zeros from non-0/non-1 elements on the left, or with insufficient open space on the right like <3 zeros).
 * Filling gaps between non-zero elements with 1's only if the gap is internal (not at edges), bounded by matching or specific values (e.g., same left/right values or right being 1), but this seems overly permissive and leads to incorrect fills in some cases.
 * Subtlety: Removals and fills are row-independent, but the overall effect should form coherent shapes across rows (e.g., in training example 3, the top forms a triangle of 9's with internal 0's, not filled 1's; bottom shapes like 4's and 2's remain intact).
 * Key consideration: 1's act as temporary fillers or connectors that should be removed if they don't belong to a valid structure (e.g., not part of a main object); avoid filling gaps indiscriminately, as this can incorrectly extend shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Edge cases like gaps at row starts/ends should not be filled; right-open space for removal decisions needs precise thresholding (e.g., >=3 zeros to justify keeping, but logic inverted in current code).
 * Across attempts: No column-wise processing, so vertical connections are ignored—may need holistic grid analysis; preserve non-1/non-0 elements exactly; 1's in bottom rows (e.g., with 2's, 4's) are sometimes valid and should not be removed.
 * No extraction of full objects yet; future attempts may need functions to detect blobs or connected components across rows/columns for better stray detection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def remove_stray_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Existing function is partially helpful for detecting sequences of 1's and basic isolation checks (left separation >=4 or right open >=3),
    # but buggy: it sometimes fails to remove valid strays (e.g., in training 3, keeps long 1-runs bounded by 9's) and inverts removal logic.
    # Use as base but fix conditions: always remove 1-sequences if left sep >=4 AND right open <3, or if fully isolated.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] == 1:
            start = i
            while i < 10 and new_row[i] == 1:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            # ... (rest as in attempt, but refine remove logic)
    return new_row
```

```python
def fill_gaps_in_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Partially helpful for gap detection, but overfills (e.g., sets 1's where expected is 0 in training 3).
    # Refine: only fill if left/right are identical non-1/non-0 AND gap size <= some limit (e.g., 2-3), and not if it creates strays.
    # Current version skips edges correctly but ignores gap size and over-applies when right==1.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] != 0:
            i += 1
            continue
        # ... (rest as in attempt, but add gap length check: if end-start+1 > 3, skip)
    return new_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, likely simple cases with clear strays or no fills needed, demonstrating basic row-wise 1-sequence detection and gap filling works for non-complex shapes.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated kept long runs of 1's in rows 1-5 (e.g., row1: [9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,9,9] vs expected [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,9]; row2: [0,9,9,1,1,1,1,9,9,0] vs [0,9,9,0,0,0,0,9,9,0]), indicating remove_stray_in_row did not trigger removal for 1-sequences bounded closely by 9's (left_sep <4 but right_open insufficient); fill_gaps_in_row then incorrectly added no extra 1's but failed to clean prior.
 * Bottom rows in training 3 unchanged and correct (e.g., row7-10 match expected), showing preservation of non-1 elements works.
 * No object extraction function yet, but row-wise processing is a good start; however, it's insufficient for vertical coherency (e.g., 1's connecting across rows not considered).
 * Function remove_stray_in_row is helpful but broken in logic (inverts remove conditions, e.g., sets remove=True only if left_sep>=4 or right_open>=3, but in training 3 it kept strays—possibly because left_non1 detection misses adjacent 9's).
 * Function fill_gaps_in_row is somewhat helpful for internal gaps but not relevant or over-applies in this puzzle (adds 1's where expected is empty space in shapes; don't use without heavy refinement or disable for stray-heavy cases).
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of stray removal but misses subtlety of when 1's are "stray" vs. structural in shape outlines.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially cleans the top (e.g., row1: [9,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] removes some 1's correctly compared to input implication; row2-3 similar), but row4: [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5] keeps a 9-run that may be stray (input has 9's there, but expected likely 0's like in training 3 pattern); row5: [0,0,0,0,9,9,9,0,0,5] similarly retains 9's that should be removed if forming invalid extension.
 * Row6: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] keeps a single 1, which looks incorrect—expected probably [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5] if 1 is stray (isolated between 5's, but fill logic didn't trigger and remove didn't catch it).
 * Bottom rows (7-10) seem mostly preserved but row8: [3,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,1,5] keeps 1 (likely stray); row9-10 have 1's in [...,1,5] that should be removed to match pattern of cleaning fillers.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: It under-removes strays in mid-top (e.g., extra 9's/1's where expected 0's for shape outline) and fails to clean isolated 1's in lower rows, differing from training 3's expected clean empties; this suggests the program handles simple top strays but misses cases with mixed numbers (3's,5's) or short 1-runs. Unknown why 9's in row4-5 weren't treated as strays (perhaps code only targets 1's, not propagating to other fillers).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a row-by-row processing puzzle on a 10x10 grid where cells contain numbers (0 for empty, 1 for fill, and >1 for colored supports or clues), and the goal is to fill in 1's between compatible supports based on proximity, color matching, and connection rules, while removing any unsupported groups of 1's to create a valid filled structure. The rules emphasize iterative filling and validation per row, likely simulating a logic puzzle like a filling or connection variant where supports propagate fills without overextending.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Fill 1's between same-color supports (>1) only if the gap between them (starting at least 2 cells apart) is entirely zeros; this "same color fill" rule bridges matching clues but skips if any non-zero intervenes.
 * "Connect fill" extends from a support (>1) across up to 3 consecutive zeros to reach an existing 1, filling those zeros with 1's; this is limited to prevent long unsupported chains and only triggers if it directly connects to a 1.
 * After filling, remove any group of consecutive 1's that lacks adjacency to a supporting cell (defined as 2-5); isolated or floating 1 groups are cleared to 0, ensuring all fills are justified by nearby supports.
 * Processing is strictly per row (no column or global interactions mentioned), and the grid is copied to avoid mutating input; iterations are over all 10 rows but apply rules independently per row.
 * Subtlety: Supports are hardcoded to {2,3,4,5}, ignoring higher numbers like 9 in the test input, which may treat them as non-supporting and prevent proper filling/validation.
 * Gap checks must be precise (e.g., start+2 minimum for same color, zeros <3 for connect), and group removal scans sequentially without revisiting, potentially missing edge cases in mixed rows.
 * No vertical propagation or multi-row rules are handled, which could be key if the puzzle involves 2D connectivity; also, no handling for diagonal or broader adjacency.
 * Iterative application per row might need multiple passes if fills create new opportunities, but the code does only one pass per row.
 * Easy to miss: 1's can act as connection points but are not supports themselves; removal only after both fill steps, so order matters.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helpful functions, types, or tools were defined in this attempt; the core logic is inline in the main function with manual loops for filling and removal. The supporting set {2,3,4,5} is useful but limited—consider generalizing to all >1 or input-specific.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core row-processing, same-color filling, connection extension, and unsupported group removal rules are correctly implemented for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Training examples 1-3 produced correct outputs, suggesting the logic handles basic same-color gaps, short connections to 1's, and support validation without issues in those grids.
 * What didn't work: The test input produced an output that appears incomplete or incorrect, with the first row entirely zeros (possibly unfilled due to no supports), partial fills in later rows (e.g., 9's not propagating as supports, leading to isolated 1's or missed connections), and a bottom-heavy structure that leaves upper rows sparse; this mismatches expected full propagation since input has 9's, 5's, and 3's which should fill more comprehensively if 9 were treated as supporting.
 * The hardcoded supporting set excludes 9 (common in test), causing 9-clue rows to not validate or propagate 1's properly, leading to under-filling.
 * Connect fill's 3-zero limit may be too restrictive for test gaps, resulting in unfilled sections (e.g., row 6 has a 1 but no extension).
 * Removal step clears some 1's correctly but may over-remove if supports like 9 are ignored, leaving artifacts like the single 1's in rows 6 and 8-10.
 * No extraction functions for objects/clues; manual scanning works for rows but could be error-prone—future attempts should include a clue finder (e.g., positions of >1 per row).
 * The same-color fill starts from every >1 and scans forward, which is efficient but misses backward fills or multi-clue interactions in dense rows.
 * Overall, demonstrates understanding of per-row iterative filling but fails on variable support values and potentially longer gaps in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows minimal filling (e.g., row 0 all 0's, row 1 only two 9's with no fill, row 6 has a isolated 1 next to 5's but no broader connection), suggesting the rules under-applied, leaving most of the grid empty or partially filled compared to expected denser 1-propagation from the visible 3's, 5's, and 9's in input (inferred from output remnants).
 * Upper rows (0-2) are mostly unfilled despite potential 9-clue starts, differing from expectation that same-color or connect rules should bridge zeros; this indicates 9's not recognized as supports, preventing validation/removal issues.
 * Lower rows (7-9) have more 3's and 5's filled out, with trailing 1's and 5's, but the single 1's (e.g., positions 8 in rows 6,8-9) look like remnants of partial connects that weren't removed, which shouldn't persist if unsupported—expected to be cleared unless adjacent to valid supports.
 * The output creates a "staircase" of fills downward (e.g., 9's in row1-4, 5's building in row4-9, 3's in row7-9), but lacks cohesion; it makes sense as a partial application of the code's rules but not as a solved puzzle, as isolated 1's and unfilled gaps (e.g., row3 has 9's then 5 but no 1's between) violate likely full-connection intent.
 * No all-zero rows expected in a valid output; row0 all 0's is probably correct if input row0 is empty, but combined with sparse upper grid, it highlights failure to propagate from below or handle non-supporting 9's.
 * To handle test, must expand supporting set to include 9 (or all >1) and possibly increase connect zero limit or add backward scanning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-filling puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram or support-based fill puzzle) on a 10x10 grid where cells are 0 (empty), 1 (fillable/connectable cells), or >1 (colored support blocks, e.g., 2-9 representing different colors or types). The goal is to apply rules to fill gaps with 1s based on proximity to supports, connect existing 1s to supports across limited empty spaces, and remove unsupported 1s, propagating these changes row-by-row to create a coherent filled structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Supports are numbers >1; low supports {2,3,4,5} are used for validating/removing stray 1s, but higher numbers like 9 and 5 appear in the test and seem to act as valid supports for filling/connecting, suggesting all >1 might support but only low ones prevent stray removal—subtle mismatch in code scope.
 * Gap filling for same color: Fill 1s in gaps of 1-3 zeros between identical colors (>1), but only if the gap is bounded by the same color on both sides; this extends color blocks indirectly via 1s.
 * Gap filling for different colors: Similar to same-color but only if gap 1-3 zeros, colors are both odd (e.g., 3 and 5, 9 and 5), and different; fills with 1s but doesn't extend the second color's scan properly in code (i increments past but doesn't adjust for it).
 * Connecting supports to 1s: From a support (>1), extend rightward (or leftward in backward pass) across up to 3 zeros to reach an existing 1, filling those zeros with 1s; this creates bridges but doesn't propagate further (e.g., no chaining multiple connections).
 * Removing stray 1s: Groups of consecutive 1s are removed (set to 0) if not adjacent (left or right) to a low support {2,3,4,5}; higher supports like 9 don't count for this, which might leave unsupported 1s in test cases.
 * Row-by-row processing order matters: Functions are applied sequentially per row (same-gap, diff-gap, connect forward, connect backward, remove strays), but no inter-row propagation (e.g., no vertical filling or alignment), assuming the puzzle is strictly horizontal per row.
 * Max gap/zeros=3 is hardcoded; might need tuning if puzzle varies, but consistent for training.
 * Subtle: In fill functions, after filling a gap with 1s, the loop continues scanning from the end of the second color block, but filled 1s aren't treated as supports, so no recursive filling in one pass—multiple iterations per row might be needed but aren't implemented.
 * Existing 1s in input (e.g., test has some 1s) act as anchors for connections but can be removed if stray.
 * Puzzle likely expects a "stable" final grid where all 1s are justified by proximity to supports, avoiding over-filling or under-filling sparse areas.
 * No object extraction (e.g., blobs or connected components) is used, but it might help identify full structures like vertical stacks of colors (e.g., 9s and 5s in test seem stacked but not vertically connected in rules).
 * Easy to miss: Odd/even parity for different-color fills (only odd-odd pairs); code checks c %2 ==1 and new_row[i]%2==1, but even supports like 2,4 might not bridge odds.
 * No handling for single-cell supports or edge cases (e.g., gaps at row ends); loops handle i<10 but may skip if gap overflows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions are mostly helpful but have bugs/subtleties noted below; no custom types or extraction tools are present, but a blob extractor could help analyze connected >1 regions vertically/horizontally for better support detection.

```python
def fill_same_color_gaps(row: List[int], max_gap: int) -> List[int]:
    # Helpful for extending same-color blocks via 1s in small gaps; works as core rule but assumes non-overlapping scans.
    # Bug: Fills with 1s, but if gap fill creates new "support" adjacency, it doesn't re-scan in same pass.
    new_row = row[:]

                    new_row[k] = 1
                while i < 10 and new_row[i] == c:
                    i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def connect_support_to_ones(row: List[int], max_zeros: int) -> List[int]:
    # Helpful for bridging supports to existing 1s; forward direction catches rightward extensions.
    # Subtle: Only connects to 1s, not to other supports; doesn't chain (e.g., support-zero-zero-1-zero-support not fully bridged).
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] > 1:

    # Issue: Limited to low_supports {2,3,4,5}; higher like 9/5 in test should probably count, leading to premature removals.
    new_row = row[:]
    i = 0
    while i < 10:
        if new_row[i] == 1:
            start = i
            while i < 10 and new_row[i] == 1:
                i += 1
            end = i - 1
            has_support = False
            if start > 0 and new_row[start - 1] in supports:
                has_support = True
            if end < 9 and new_row[end + 1] in supports:
                has_support = True
            if not has_support:
                for k in range(start, end + 1):
                    new_row[k] = 0
        else:
            i += 1
    return new_row
```

The other functions (fill_different_color_gaps, connect_support_to_ones_backward) are similar but less robust: fill_different has a bug in i-increment after filling (skips second color block without re-adjusting), and backward connect is helpful for leftward but redundant if forward+backward cover all; include if directionality matters.

No extraction functions provided; a helpful one might be:

```python
def extract_color_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[tuple]] :  # Returns list of (row, col_start, col_end, color) for >1 blobs
    blobs = []
    for r in range(10):
        c = 0
        while c < 10:
            if g[r][c] > 1:
                color = g[r][c]
                start = c
                while c < 10 and g[r][c] == color:
                    c += 1
                blobs.append((r, start, c-1, color))
            else:
                c += 1
    return blobs  # Could extend to vertical blobs for inter-row rules if needed
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; training examples 1-3 all correct, showing core rules (gap filling, connecting, stray removal) work for simple cases like isolated supports with small gaps or existing 1s.
 * What worked: Sequential row processing correctly propagates fills in training (e.g., likely filled gaps in same/diff colors and connected without over-removing).
 * What didn't work: Limited propagation—no iteration loops mean fills/connections don't chain (e.g., a new 1 from one rule doesn't enable further connections in same row); backward connect scans from end but may miss if forward already filled.
 * fill_different_color_gaps is buggy: After filling, it sets c2 and increments i past the second block, but doesn't adjust for potential new gaps created by 1s; also, condition c %2==1 and new_row[i]%2==1 is too restrictive if evens can bridge in some cases (unknown if needed).
 * connect functions only bridge to 1s, not to other supports, missing potential support-to-support fills via 1s.
 * remove_stray_ones too narrow (only {2,3,4,5}); higher colors like 9/5 in test act as supports for filling but not for retention, possibly removing valid 1s.
 * No vertical considerations: Puzzle may imply vertical alignment (e.g., stacked 9s and 5s in test columns), but code is purely horizontal, missing cross-row supports.
 * Overall, attempt understands horizontal filling but under-fills complex propagations; no object extraction means no global structure awareness (e.g., identifying full color regions).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows sparse filling: Row 0 all 0s (expected if no supports/1s in input); rows 1-2 have partial 9s but no fills; rows 3-9 have some 9s/5s/3s and limited 1s (e.g., row 4 has two 1s next to 5, row 8-9 have 1s adjacent to 5s), suggesting connections happened but minimally.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected more propagation, e.g., column 9 has stacked 5s from row 3-9 with some 1s, but gaps like row 1-2 column 9 are 0 (input likely had 0s there), and no fills bridge them—code's max_gap=3 should fill if odd-odd (9 odd? Wait, 9>1 odd, but row1 [9,9,0...] doesn't connect downward). Row 7 has 1 next to 5, but earlier rows' 1s (row4-6) might be strays if not low-supported, yet persist, indicating remove_stray_ones didn't trigger or supports like 5 count partially.
 * Missing fills: E.g., row 3 [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5] has 9s and distant 5 (odd-odd), gap>3 zeros so no fill, but if vertical stacking implies connection, output ignores it (all horizontal). Row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,1,5] has 1 between 5s (same color, gap=0? but already 1), correct, but no extension leftward.
 * Differences from expected: Expected denser 1s bridging the 9-stack (cols 1-4 rows1-5) to 5-stack (col9 rows3-9) and 3-stack (cols0-3 rows6-9), perhaps filling horizontal gaps with 1s if <3 zeros, but output has large 0 regions (e.g., row4 cols0-3 all 0 despite nearby 9s/5s). Unknown if input had more 1s/seeds, but output seems under-filled compared to a "complete" structure; first row all 0s makes sense if empty, but overall grid looks incomplete (e.g., no 1s in row1-3 despite supports).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 10x10 grid where colored blocks (numbers >1, likely representing different colors or types) need to be connected or extended via support structures (1's filling gaps), following rules for gap sizes, color parity, and support validity, while removing unsupported 1's to form coherent structures across rows. The goal is to process each row independently but consistently to reveal or complete the underlying puzzle image or pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules include filling gaps (0's) between same-color blocks if the gap is 1-3 cells wide (max_gap=3), effectively extending the color block.
 * For different colors, gaps can be filled with 1's only if both colors are odd-numbered (e.g., 3 and 5, but not 2 and 3), and the gap is 1-3 wide; this seems to allow bridging between compatible (odd) colors.
 * Supports (1's) can connect to existing 1's by filling up to 3 consecutive 0's forward or backward from a color block (>1), but only if it reaches another 1.
 * Stray 1's (isolated groups of 1's) must be removed if not adjacent to a valid support color (defined as {2,3,4,5}); note that higher numbers like 9 are treated as colors but not as supports for validating 1's, which may lead to incomplete structures.
 * Processing is row-by-row and sequential (fill same, then different, then connect forward/backward, then remove strays), which can create cascading effects but risks over-filling or missing vertical alignments if rows aren't considered interdependently.
 * Subtle elements: Gaps are only filled if bounded by the same color on both sides for same-color fills; different-color fills require odd parity and skip even colors; connections to 1's are directional (forward/backward separately) and limited to max_zeros=3, potentially missing longer chains; the grid may have vertical continuity (e.g., colors stacking like in a nonogram or blob puzzle), so row-wise processing might ignore column-wise support.
 * Easy-to-miss: Colors like 9 (odd but not in supports) can initiate fills but can't validate adjacent 1's, leading to removals; all-zero rows remain empty unless connected; the program assumes 10-column fixed width and doesn't handle edge cases like gaps at row ends.
 * Considerations across attempts: No extraction of multi-row objects (e.g., vertical blobs or connected components across rows/columns), which might be needed for global structure; no validation against a "key" or expected pattern; functions don't account for color-specific rules (e.g., 9 might be a special "high" color not bridgeable); potential over-removal of 1's if supports are narrowly defined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new types or tools introduced; the existing row-processing functions (fill_same_color_gaps, fill_different_color_gaps, connect_support_to_ones, connect_support_to_ones_backward, remove_stray_ones) are helpful for linear gap filling and cleanup but are row-only and lack vertical integration. For future, a function to extract vertical objects (e.g., connected components) would help:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

class VerticalBlob:
    def __init__(self):
        self.color = 0
        self.positions: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []  # (row, col) spans
        self.gap_sizes = []

def extract_vertical_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[VerticalBlob]:
    blobs = []
    visited = [[False] * 10 for _ in range(10)]
    for col in range(10):
        for row in range(10):
            if g[row][col] > 0 and not visited[row][col]:
                blob = VerticalBlob()
                blob.color = g[row][col]
                # BFS or DFS to collect connected same-color cells vertically/horizontally
                stack = [(row, col)]
                while stack:
                    r, c = stack.pop()
                    if visited[r][c]:
                        continue
                    visited[r][c] = True
                    blob.positions.append((r, c))
                    # Add neighbors (up, down, left, right) if same color
                    for dr, dc in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < 10 and 0 <= nc < 10 and g[nr][nc] == blob.color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                if len(blob.positions) > 1:  # Only multi-cell blobs
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt correctly handled training examples 1-3, successfully filling gaps, connecting supports, and removing strays to match expected outputs, demonstrating understanding of row-wise gap filling for same/different colors and basic support validation.
 * Missed handling of non-support colors like 9, which initiates fills but can't anchor 1's, leading to potential removals in remove_stray_ones.
 * Connect_support_to_ones and connect_support_to_ones_backward worked for short gaps in training but may not chain multiple connections or handle vertical influences.
 * Fill_different_color_gaps is helpful but overly restrictive (only odd-odd pairs), which might miss even-odd bridges if rules allow them.
 * Remove_stray_ones is essential for cleanup but broken for colors outside {2,3,4,5} (e.g., 9), causing valid 1's near 9's to be erroneously removed.
 * No previous attempts shown beyond this one; however, the program lacks global considerations like vertical connectivity, which could explain training success (simple row patterns) but test failure (stacked colors like 9's over 3's/5's).
 * Fill_same_color_gaps is correct and relevant, handling intra-color extensions well.
 * The sequential order (same -> different -> connect -> remove) is helpful but may propagate errors if earlier fills create invalid strays.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows minimal filling (e.g., first row remains all 0's, indicating no connections initiated), with 9's in upper rows barely extended and lower rows having isolated 3's, 5's, and 1's that don't form coherent vertical structures.
 * Expected output likely involves more 1's bridging the 9's downward to the 3's and 5's (e.g., filling gaps in columns 0-2 for 9-to-3, or column 9 for 5's), and possibly extending 5's horizontally/vertically, but the generated output leaves large zero areas (e.g., rows 1-2 have trailing 0's, row 4 has unfilled 0's before 9's).
 * The 1's in lower rows (e.g., row 4: positions 7-8; row 5: position 8) appear as partial supports but are likely strays near 5's, and without proper anchoring (since 9 isn't a support), they may have been added then not removed correctly, differing from expectation of full vertical chains.
 * Upper 9's (rows 1-4) should probably connect via 1's to lower 3's/5's given odd parity (9 and 3/5 are odd), but output shows no such bridging, leaving disconnected blobs—unknown why fill_different_color_gaps didn't trigger, possibly due to gap sizes >3 vertically or row-only processing.
 * Bottom row has 3's extended left but abrupt shift to 5's with 1's at end, which doesn't match a clean structure; expected more uniform filling or removal of the trailing 1 if unsupported.
 * Overall, the output is too sparse and disconnected compared to what puzzle rules suggest (coherent colored regions with supports), indicating the program fails on multi-row, high-color (9) cases.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10

**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle on a 10x10 board where cells contain 0 (empty), 1 (neutral filler/support), or numbers 2-9 representing colored blocks. The objective is to infer and place 1's to fill small gaps between supported colored blocks (based on vertical adjacency from above/below rows), connect supported blocks to existing 1's over limited empty spaces, and remove unsupported or stray 1's, following rules for same-color continuity, odd-color bridging, and support validation to create stable structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Colored blocks (2-9) act as primary supports; 1's are secondary fillers that must be adjacent to supports {2,3,4,5} or justified by rules to avoid being "stray."
 * Support for a block requires at least one cell directly above or below in the same column matching the block's color (vertical stacking or adjacency).
 * Gap filling is limited to 1-3 consecutive 0's; larger gaps cannot be filled.
 * Same-color gaps: Fill with 1's only if both flanking blocks of the same color are supported.
 * Different-color gaps: Fill with 1's only if both flanking blocks are odd-numbered colors (e.g., 3 and 5, but not 3 and 4), and both are supported; even-odd or even-even pairs do not bridge.
 * Connection rules: Supported blocks can extend 1's forward/backward over up to 3 0's if they connect to an existing 1.
 * Stray 1's: Isolated runs of 1's (not adjacent left/right to a support color like 2-5) must be removed to 0.
 * Process rows independently but check vertical supports across the full grid; apply fills in sequence (same-gap, different-gap, connect-forward, connect-backward, remove-strays) per row to avoid over-filling.
 * Subtlety: Functions must skip/advance indices correctly after blocks/gaps to avoid infinite loops or missing segments; 1's do not count as supports for further colored block validation.
 * Subtlety: Odd-color bridging only applies if colors differ and both are odd; same-color takes precedence if applicable.
 * Edge cases: Blocks at row edges (r=0 or r=9) have limited vertical support options; single-cell blocks or gaps of size 1 need same validation.
 * No diagonal or horizontal support; only vertical for block support, horizontal adjacency for stray removal.
 * Colors like 9 (odd) can bridge with other odds (e.g., 3,5,9), but the code's supports set {2,3,4,5} excludes higher colors like 9, which may limit stray removal or connections.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core rules for gap filling, connections, and stray removal are correctly implemented for those cases.
 * What worked: Sequential application of fill_same_color_gaps, fill_different_color_gaps, connect_support_to_ones_forward/backward, and remove_stray_ones per row correctly inferred 1's in training grids without over- or under-filling.
 * What didn't work: Unclear without correct test output, but potential issues include limited supports set {2,3,4,5} excluding higher colors like 9, which appear in test (may leave 1's adjacent to 9 as "stray" incorrectly); backward/forward connections may not chain multiple times if applied only once per row.
 * Index advancement in gap-filling loops works well to skip processed segments, avoiding re-processing.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt demonstrates understanding of vertical support and horizontal gap rules; however, odd-color bridging may miss if colors like 9 aren't treated as full supports.
 * Function is_block_supported is essential and correct for vertical validation.
 * Functions like fill_same_color_gaps and fill_different_color_gaps are helpful and capture key subtleties (gap size, support per block).
 * connect_support_to_ones_forward/backward are useful for extending to existing 1's but may need iteration if new 1's enable further connections.
 * remove_stray_ones is critical for cleanup but limited by hardcoded supports {2,3,4,5}; if puzzle allows 9 as support, this is broken for test cases with 9.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows progressive filling downward: row 0 all 0's (no changes); row 1 starts with [9,9,...]; row 3 has [0,0,9,9,9,0,0,0,0,5]; row 4 fills [0,0,0,0,9,9,9,1,1,5] (likely connecting 9's to existing 1's or bridging to 5); row 5 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,5] (gap in 5's not filled, possibly unsupported or >3 zeros? but only 1 zero); row 7 [3,3,0,0,0,0,5,5,1,5] (large gap between 3's and 5's unfilled, correct if even gap size or unsupported); row 8 [3,3,3,1,1,5,5,5,1,5] (1's filled in gaps, possibly different-odd bridge 3-5 and connection); row 9 [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,1,5] (more 1's connecting 3's to 5's).
 * The output makes partial sense: It fills small gaps near supported 9's/5's/3's (e.g., 1's in row 4 cols 7-8, row 8 cols 3-4 and 8) and leaves larger/unsupported gaps empty (e.g., row 7 cols 2-5), consistent with rules. However, it does not look fully correct—e.g., row 5 has a single 0 between two 5's (cols 7 and 9), which should fill with 1 if both 5's are supported (check vertical: row 4 col7=1? no, row4 col9=5, row6 col9=5, but need per-block support); the 1 in row 9 col8 seems connected but may be stray if not adjacent to 2-5 (next to 5). Also, no fillings in early rows despite potential vertical stacks (e.g., 9's in rows 1-4). Differences from expected: Expected more bridging for odd colors 3/5/9 across small gaps (e.g., fill row 7 gap partially? but 4 zeros >3, so correct not to); unknown why row 5 gap unfilled (possibly unsupported 5's). Overall, it demonstrates rule application but may miss chained fills or expanded supports for 9.

[2025-10-02 03:05:24] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on consistent patterns observed across all three train examples (no assumptions about the test input, as consistency must hold for every provided puzzle), the following are the only obvious, consistent interconnections between components and properties. These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case, without forcing explanations for the nature of the transformation (which remains unknown and unattempted here). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated properties like holes=0, which never change or interact; pixel counts of non-blue blocks, which are static but not causally linked to changes) are excluded. Only interactions present in *all* train inputs/outputs are included.

#### Components Involved in Interactions
- **Fixed Blocks (Non-Blue Colored Blocks)**: These include Green, Red, Orange, Light Blue, and Yellow blocks. They form a static "environment" that does not change.
  - Properties: Color, bbox (position and size), pixels.
  - Behavior: Always unchanged from input to output (exact same bbox coordinates, pixel counts, and color in every example).
- **Transformable Blocks (Blue Blocks)**: These are the only blocks that change configuration.
  - Properties: Color (always remains Blue), bbox (position and size), pixels (individual counts change, but aggregate interacts with fixed blocks), number of instances (can vary).
  - Behavior: Always transform in every example, with total pixels conserved, but individual shapes/positions/number altered.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections that occur in *every* train example. No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color changes, hole-related effects, or irrelevant static properties) are consistently observed.

1. **Position of Fixed Blocks → Position and Shape (bbox) of Blue Blocks**:
   - The bbox coordinates (x/y ranges) of non-blue fixed blocks consistently affect the resulting bbox coordinates of blue blocks in the output.
   - Effect: Blue blocks are repositioned or reshaped (e.g., extended, shortened, split, or merged) relative to the fixed blocks' positions. This is evident in all examples where output blue bboxes align adjacent to, overlap with, or span across fixed blocks' bboxes (e.g., new blue segments appear near fixed block edges or within their x/y ranges).
   - Consistency: Present in every train pair; no transformation occurs without fixed blocks influencing blue placement. (Unknown: Exact rule of influence, e.g., adjacency vs. overlap.)

2. **Aggregate Pixels of Blue Blocks ↔ Fixed Blocks (Conservation Amid Transformation)**:
   - The total pixel count across all blue blocks in the input equals the total in the output, while interacting with the static environment of fixed blocks.
   - Effect: Individual blue pixel counts redistribute (e.g., via splitting or merging), but the sum remains invariant, suggesting the fixed blocks constrain or guide this redistribution without altering the total "mass."
   - Consistency: Exact total pixel conservation for blues in every example (e.g., 20→20, 25→25, 3→3), with no such conservation applied to non-blues (which don't change anyway).

3. **Number of Blue Blocks ↔ Position of Fixed Blocks (Splitting/Merging)**:
   - The number of blue block instances can change (1→2, 2→1, or 1→2), driven by interaction with fixed blocks' positions.
   - Effect: Blues split or merge into multiple/single instances, with new instances positioned relative to fixed blocks (e.g., small blues appear at specific x/y coordinates tied to fixed bboxes).
   - Consistency: Number changes in every example, always resulting in blue reconfiguration influenced by fixed positions; no change in non-blue numbers.

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded for Lack of Consistency)
- No consistent color changes or interactions (e.g., blue never becomes non-blue; non-blues never gain/lose color).
- No hole-related interactions (holes=0 universally, with no effect on anything).
- No isolated pixel changes for fixed blocks (static, no causal link).
- No self-interactions among fixed blocks (they don't affect each other).
- No consistent effects from blue-to-blue without fixed block involvement (transformations always occur in context of fixed positions).

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections; all transformations of blue blocks relative to fixed blocks remain unexplained beyond the above effects.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:08:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on consistent patterns observed across all three train examples (no assumptions about the test input, as consistency must hold for every provided puzzle), the following are the only obvious, consistent interconnections between components and properties. These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case, without forcing explanations for the nature of the transformation (which remains unknown and unattempted here). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., isolated properties like holes=0, which never change or interact; pixel counts of non-blue blocks, which are static but not causally linked to changes) are excluded. Only interactions present in *all* train inputs/outputs are included.

#### Components Involved in Interactions
- **Fixed Blocks (Non-Blue Colored Blocks)**: These include Green, Red, Orange, Light Blue, and Yellow blocks. They form a static "environment" that does not change.
  - Properties: Color, bbox (position and size), pixels.
  - Behavior: Always unchanged from input to output (exact same bbox coordinates, pixel counts, and color in every example).
- **Transformable Blocks (Blue Blocks)**: These are the only blocks that change configuration.
  - Properties: Color (always remains Blue), bbox (position and size), pixels (individual counts change, but aggregate interacts with fixed blocks), number of instances (can vary).
  - Behavior: Always transform in every example, with total pixels conserved, but individual shapes/positions/number altered.

#### Consistent Interactions and Effects
These are the only connections that occur in *every* train example. No other interactions (e.g., color-to-color changes, hole-related effects, or irrelevant static properties) are consistently observed.

1. **Position of Fixed Blocks → Position and Shape (bbox) of Blue Blocks**:
   - The bbox coordinates (x/y ranges) of non-blue fixed blocks consistently affect the resulting bbox coordinates of blue blocks in the output.
   - Effect: Blue blocks are repositioned or reshaped (e.g., extended, shortened, split, or merged) relative to the fixed blocks' positions. This is evident in all examples where output blue bboxes align adjacent to, overlap with, or span across fixed blocks' bboxes (e.g., new blue segments appear near fixed block edges or within their x/y ranges).
   - Consistency: Present in every train pair; no transformation occurs without fixed blocks influencing blue placement. (Unknown: Exact rule of influence, e.g., adjacency vs. overlap.)

2. **Aggregate Pixels of Blue Blocks ↔ Fixed Blocks (Conservation Amid Transformation)**:
   - The total pixel count across all blue blocks in the input equals the total in the output, while interacting with the static environment of fixed blocks.
   - Effect: Individual blue pixel counts redistribute (e.g., via splitting or merging), but the sum remains invariant, suggesting the fixed blocks constrain or guide this redistribution without altering the total "mass."
   - Consistency: Exact total pixel conservation for blues in every example (e.g., 20→20, 25→25, 3→3), with no such conservation applied to non-blues (which don't change anyway).

3. **Number of Blue Blocks ↔ Position of Fixed Blocks (Splitting/Merging)**:
   - The number of blue block instances can change (1→2, 2→1, or 1→2), driven by interaction with fixed blocks' positions.
   - Effect: Blues split or merge into multiple/single instances, with new instances positioned relative to fixed blocks (e.g., small blues appear at specific x/y coordinates tied to fixed bboxes).
   - Consistency: Number changes in every example, always resulting in blue reconfiguration influenced by fixed positions; no change in non-blue numbers.

#### Non-Interactions (Explicitly Excluded for Lack of Consistency)
- No consistent color changes or interactions (e.g., blue never becomes non-blue; non-blues never gain/lose color).
- No hole-related interactions (holes=0 universally, with no effect on anything).
- No isolated pixel changes for fixed blocks (static, no causal link).
- No self-interactions among fixed blocks (they don't affect each other).
- No consistent effects from blue-to-blue without fixed block involvement (transformations always occur in context of fixed positions).

These are the only obvious, consistent interconnections; all transformations of blue blocks relative to fixed blocks remain unexplained beyond the above effects.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:27:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a 10x10 grid puzzle involving colored cells (values >1) and empty cells (0), with temporary blue fillers (1) already present or to be added. The goal is to identify connected components of each color, fill specific horizontal gaps with 1's under connectivity rules, and then remove an equal number of the topmost original 1's to simulate some kind of "balancing" or "falling" mechanic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components for each color C (>1) are built using union-find on orthogonal (up/down/left/right) adjacency of cells exactly equal to C; diagonals do not count, and 0's or 1's do not connect them.
 * Horizontal gap filling occurs only in rows, starting from a cell with C>1, scanning right for consecutive 0's until the next non-0 (m), and filling the gap (positions c+1 to k=m-1) with 1's only if: the gap size is 1, or the left endpoint and right endpoint (or vertical below the right end) are both C and in the same component.
 * Do not fill gaps between different colors (e.g., between 2 and 4), even if the below-the-end cell is the left's color C and same component—this over-fills and is a key mistake, as seen in training example 3 where a gap between 2 and 4 was incorrectly filled despite vertical connection via below.
 * Filling adds to num_added (only counts new 1's placed in 0's); original 1's are not altered during filling.
 * After filling, sort all original 1's positions (from input g) by row then column (top-left first), and set the first num_added of them to 0 in the output—this simulates removing "excess" or "top" blues, but only affects original 1's, not newly filled ones.
 * Subtlety: The loop in fill_gaps skips to m after processing a C-start, so it handles consecutive C's without filling (no gap), but may miss nested gaps if not careful; also, vertical checks are only at the right end of the gap (g[r+1][k] == C), not the whole gap or left.
 * 1's in input are treated as blockers (not 0's, so gaps stop at them) and are candidates for later removal, but their presence may indicate pre-filled gaps or separate elements.
 * No vertical filling in this mechanic—only horizontal gaps are considered, but components include vertical connections for the "same component" check.
 * Edge cases: Single-cell gaps (size=1) always fill if endpoint conditions met; large gaps (e.g., size>1) require same-component verification; no filling if no gap (k <= c); components dict only includes positions with exact C.
 * Overall, the puzzle seems to "complete" color lines horizontally while preserving structure, then "drop" or remove top extras to avoid over-filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

class UF:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.parent = list(range(n))

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        px = self.find(x)
        py = self.find(y)
        if px != py:
            self.parent[px] = py
```
This Union-Find class is essential for efficiently tracking connected components of each color.

```python
def build_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, Dict[Tuple[int, int], int]]:
    """
    Builds connected components for each color C > 1 using UF.
    Returns dict[C] = dict[(r,c): root] for positions with C.
    Connects only orthogonal adjacent cells == C.
    """
    components = {}
    all_fixed = {val for row in g for val in row if val > 1}
    for C in all_fixed:
        uf = UF(100)  # 10x10 flattened
        for r in range(10):
            for c in range(10):
                if g[r][c] == C:
                    pos = r * 10 + c
                    # Check up, down, left, right for same C
                    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                        if 0 <= nr < 10 and 0 <= nc < 10 and g[nr][nc] == C:
                            uf.union(pos, nr * 10 + nc)
        comp_dict = {}
        for r in range(10):
            for c in range(10):
                if g[r][c] == C:
                    comp_dict[(r, c)] = uf.find(r * 10 + c)
        components[C] = comp_dict
    return components
```
This function correctly extracts components per color, useful for verifying connectivity before filling.

```python
def get_original_blues(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """
    Extract and sort original 1 positions by row, then col for top-to-bottom removal.
    """
    blues = [(r, c) for r in range(10) for c in range(10) if g[r][c] == 1]
    return sorted(blues, key=lambda p: (p[0], p[1]))
```
Helpful for the removal step; sorts top-left first.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating the core structure (component building with UF, horizontal gap detection in rows, conditional filling based on size/component, and top-original-1 removal) works for cases without problematic cross-color gaps or complex vertical connections.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated extra 1's at row7 col1 and col2 (output: [2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, ...] vs. expected [2, 0, 0, 4, 1, 4, ...]), likely because the code filled a horizontal gap of 0's starting after a 2 (left C=2), ending before a 4 (different color), using the elif condition where below the gap end (row8 col2=2) was C=2 and same component (connected via row9 2's)—this over-filled between different colors, which should not happen; num_added=2 led to removing 2 top original 1's elsewhere, but the unwanted fills persisted since removal only hits original 1's.
 * The fill_gaps function's elif below check is helpful for some vertical-connect cases but broken for cross-color horizontal gaps (triggers wrongly when right bound != C); it correctly skips non-gaps and handles consecutive C's.
 * build_components is accurate and essential, as it captures multi-row connections (e.g., via row9 linking separate 2's in row8).
 * remove_top_blues works as intended (sorts original 1's and zeros the top num_added), but unhelpful if num_added includes invalid fills, as it doesn't touch new 1's—leading to persistent extras in train3.
 * The main loop in fill_gaps correctly advances c=m to skip after gaps/C's, avoiding double-processing, but misses that filling should require both ends to be C for horizontal (pure vertical connect at right end only applies if right is also C, or perhaps remove the elif entirely).
 * No vertical filling attempted, which seems correct—no evidence of needing it.
 * Overall, partial understanding: core horizontal filling and removal demonstrated (passes 2/3 trains), but subtlety of avoiding cross-color fills missed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is identical to the input grid, with no new 1's added (num_added=0) and no removals, which makes sense and appears correct: no qualifying horizontal 0-gaps exist for same colors (e.g., 9's are consecutive in rows; 5's have 1's or no 0's between; 3's gaps in row6/7/8 end at different colors like 5 without below-end matching C=3 in a way that triggers, and right bounds !=C so no fill).
 * Existing 1's (e.g., row2 col3=1, row5 col8=1, row7 col8=1, row8 col8=1, row9 col8=1) are preserved as blockers/non-0's, correctly not treated as gaps.
 * No obvious errors like over-filling (e.g., no cross-color triggers as in train3, since below checks fail: row7 gap after 3's ends at 5!=3, below row8 col5=5!=3; similar for others), so it aligns with rules—output looks correct, but confirm if puzzle expects any vertical or other fills (none indicated).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 03:27:42] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 03:29:21] Response:
- **Non-Blue components (e.g., Green, Red, Orange, Light Blue, Yellow) and their properties**: These components consistently remain static across all train examples, with no changes to color, bbox, or pixels from input to output. They do not interact with or affect any other components.
- **Blue components and total pixels**: The aggregate pixel count for all Blue components is conserved between input and output in every train example (e.g., Train 1: 20 → 20; Train 2: 25 → 25; Train 3: 3 → 3). Individual Blue bboxes may change, merge, split, or generate new Blues, indicating internal interaction among Blues, but the specific transformation mechanism (e.g., how positions or other properties influence splitting/merging) is unknown and not consistently explainable.
- **Holes property**: Consistently 0 for all components across inputs and outputs, with no interactions or changes observed.
- **Color consistency**: Existing non-Blue components retain their color; new or transformed components are always Blue, suggesting color as a static identifier for non-interacting elements versus the interactive Blue group. No color changes or transfers occur.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:29:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:

        count += sum(1 for cell in row if cell == 1)
    return count

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 03:50:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 10x10 grids with numbered cells representing colors or objects (e.g., 0=empty, 1=blue, 3=red, 5=green, 9=yellow, 2=purple?), where the goal appears to be repositioning all blue cells (1s) within their connected component—defined as adjacent 0s and 1s via 4-directional connectivity—by clearing existing 1s and placing exactly as many 1s as originally present into specific positions of that component, sorted in a particular order to match an expected "compacted" or rule-based layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The connected component must include all empty (0) cells adjacent to any blue (1) cells in the component, treating 0s and 1s as traversable; however, other numbers (e.g., 2,3,5,9) act as barriers, blocking connectivity.
 * There may be only one primary blue component per grid, but the search must start from a specific blue (e.g., top-left most) to ensure the correct region is captured; if multiple disconnected blue groups exist, the code assumes a single component containing all blues, which could fail if not all blues are reachable via 0s.
 * Repositioning: Clear all original 1s first, then place exactly n 1s (where n=total blues) into the first n positions of the sorted component list; sorting order is critical—current attempt uses key=(-row, -col), prioritizing top rows (assuming row 0=top) then rightmost columns within rows, but this may need adjustment (e.g., to bottom-up, left-to-right) based on mismatches.
 * Subtlety: If the component size is smaller than n, the code does nothing (pass), but this is likely unhandled correctly; grids may have blues "floating" in larger empty areas, and placement must preserve non-blue elements (e.g., 2,3,5,9 stay fixed).
 * Other colors (2,3,5,9) are static and not affected; the puzzle focuses solely on blues, but connectivity ignores them as walls.
 * Edge cases: Blues touching grid edges or other objects; ensure BFS visits all reachable 0s/1s without leaking into other areas; count_blues must accurately tally only 1s across the whole grid.
 * Potential multiple components: If blues are in separate regions (not connected via 0s), the code only processes one, leading to under-placement; all training examples seem to have one component, but test may differ.
 * Visually, expected outputs show blues "shifted" toward certain directions (e.g., rightward or downward in train1), suggesting sorting like ascending row then ascending col (top-left compaction) or reverse.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid without mutation; essential for safe experimentation.)

```python
def count_blues(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for row in g:
        count += sum(1 for cell in row if cell == 1)
    return count
```
(Accurately counts total blues; correct and reusable, as it works in all examples.)

```python
def find_blue_component(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    visited = [[False for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]
    component = []
    queue = deque()
    found = False
    for r in range(10):
        for c in range(10):
            if g[r][c] == 1 and not visited[r][c]:
                queue.append((r, c))
                visited[r][c] = True
                found = True
                component.append((r, c))
                break
        if found:
            break
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        cr, cc = queue.popleft()
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = cr + dr, cc + dc
            if 0 <= nr < 10 and 0 <= nc < 10 and not visited[nr][nc] and (g[nr][nc] == 0 or g[nr][nc] == 1):
                visited[nr][nc] = True
                queue.append((nr, nc))
                component.append((nr, nc))
    return component
```
(BFS to extract the connected component starting from top-left blue, including adjacent 0s; helpful for isolating the region, but currently only handles one component and starts from first found blue—may need expansion to union all blue components if disconnected.)

The main program function integrates these but has flawed sorting/placement logic.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Incorrect—generated output placed 1s in bottom-left positions (e.g., row7 cols0-3 all 1s, row9 cols0-1 as 1s) and omitted 1s in upper-middle (e.g., rows2-5 col8-9 empty instead of 1s), while expected shifts 1s rightward (e.g., row7 cols0-3 as 0s, rows2-5 col8-9 as 1s, row9 col0 as 0); difference likely due to sorting prioritizing wrong direction (current top-right bias mismatches expected top-right but bottom-left compaction).
 * Training example 2: Correct—placement matched expected, suggesting single component with compatible sorting.
 * Training example 3: Correct—similar to train2, worked for that grid's structure.
 * Overall: Code correctly counts n blues and clears originals, but component extraction assumes one connected region (works for train2/3 but fails train1, possibly due to partial connectivity or starting point); sorting key=(-row, -col) succeeds sometimes but fails train1 by compacting to top-right instead of the needed pattern (e.g., preserving rightward shift in upper rows).
 * If len(component) < n, code passes (does nothing), but this is untested and likely broken—should perhaps error or fill available.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the sorting in main program is flawed/not general (don't reuse directly; adjust to (row, col) for top-left or (row, -col) for top-right).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 1s primarily in bottom rows (e.g., row7 col8=1; row8 cols3,4,8=1; row9 col8=1; total ~5 ones), within a region of 3s and 5s, while upper rows have 9s intact and no 1s; this does not look correct, as it seems to compact 1s bottom-right without shifting them into the upper 9-region or leftward—expected likely involves moving 1s into the connected empty/1 areas near the 9s (e.g., rows1-5 have 9s and 0s, possibly part of component), filling top-left of that component instead of bottom; differences include no 1s in row1-6 despite 0s there, and over-concentration in row8-9, suggesting sorting still wrong for this multi-object layout (9s as barriers?); mentally, rules imply blues should flood into the large empty area above the 5s/3s, compacting top-to-bottom left-to-right, but generated ignores that.
