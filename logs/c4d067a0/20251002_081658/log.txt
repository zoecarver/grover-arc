=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:16:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:28:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents a multi-tiered structure (like a tower or building) with colored square bars of uniform height H arranged horizontally across signal columns, where "signal rows" indicate the color assignments for each tier level (k), and the goal is to detect an existing partial tier, infer missing tier positions and colors, and fill in the background-only areas of those bars without overwriting existing content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is always the dominant color (e.g., 8 in examples 1-2, 1 in example 3, 3 in test), typically filling most of the grid; signals and bars use distinct colors ≠ bg.
 * Signal rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-based) that contain non-bg signals in specific columns (1,3,5 initially, but extensible); these rows encode tier colors for levels k=1 to T via positions in signal columns.
 * Signal columns start as [1,3] (or [1,3,5] if signals present), but can extend rightward in steps (e.g., +5 for N=2, or H+1 otherwise) to match the number of bars N in an existing tier; colors in signal rows at these columns define the palette for that tier.
 * Existing tiers are contiguous blocks of H identical rows with vertical square bars (width=height=H, non-bg color) separated by bg; detection requires finding such a block with at least one bar, then using its bar starts, colors, and position to anchor computations.
 * Tier positions (starts) are computed relative to the existing tier's level k: above uses upward steps (alternating small_step=H+1 and large_step=H+2, but reversed for prev_k), below uses downward steps similarly; for N=2 (two bars), fixed delta=5; gaps between tiers must fit within grid bounds without overlap.
 * Horizontal bar extension: If existing tier has M < N bars, extend rightward from the last bar_start by step_col (5 for N=2, H+1 otherwise) to reach N positions; fill each bar as a HxH square only on bg cells, using the color from signal row for that k and bar j.
 * Subtleties: Tier height H must match bar width exactly for detection; multiple identical rows count toward height; if no existing tier, do nothing; signals may be sparse (None if bg), skipping fills for missing colors; for N>2, signal cols include 5 only if signals present; tier numbering k starts at 1 (bottom-up? but code assumes signal_rows[0] is k=1); in example 3, bg=1 but signals use 2,3,4; test has wider grid (27 cols) with more complex signals/bars.
 * Edge cases: T=0 (no signals, unchanged grid); out-of-bounds tiers skipped; partial signals (e.g., only left bars signaled); existing tier may not be at k=1; bars don't overlap signals or existing content; in test, multiple tier groups (e.g., rows 5-8 partial fill with 1's, rows 10-13 with 4/2, rows 16-19 empty?, rows 21-24 with 8? but incomplete).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core issues in tier positioning, color assignment, or extension logic.
 * Train 1: Detected existing tier at rows 1-3 (H=3? but signals suggest H=1? wait, code detects H from contiguous rows) with 4's, but failed to fill lower tier at rows 6-8 with 1's (three rows of 1's in cols 8-10 and 13-15) and upper at 11-13; generated left signals/bars untouched but no new fills; expected has full 3-row bars of 1's in those positions, suggesting missed computation of tier_starts for k=2,3 with steps.
 * Train 1: Also no extension to third bar position (cols ~18-20?); existing has two bars of 4's (cols 8-10,13-15), but signals include col 5? with no fill.
 * Train 2: Detected partial fills (e.g., row 4 has 1's at 1,3; row 5 has 2's at 10-11,14-15 but incomplete), but missed full tiers: expected has rows 7-8 with 1's at 10-11,14-15; rows 10-11 with 1's + 3's at 16-17; rows 13-14 with 1's + 3's; generated has sparse 2's/1's/3's but no contiguous 2-row (H=2?) bars, and extra 3 at row5 col5; suggests wrong H detection (maybe H=1 or 2), incorrect k assignment, or bad step deltas (used 5 for N=2 but perhaps not).
 * Train 2: Signal rows detected as [1,3,7,9?] but code stops at first empty, missing lower signals; generated has no fills below row6, but expected extends to row14.
 * Train 3: Bg=1, signals in odd rows with 2,3,4 at cols1,3,5; detected some bars (e.g., row15-16 with 2's at11-12 +3's at16-17? but generated has them, wait no—generated has row15-16: 2's at11-12,1's? wait, output shows row15:1's bg with 2,2 at11-12,3,3 at16-17 but messed up positions; expected has row10-11:2's at11-12,3's at16-17; row15-16:3's at11-12,3's at16-17? wait, expected row15-16:3's at11-12 +3's at16-17, but generated has wrong colors/placements (e.g., row15 has 2's and 3's but also 1's bg); lower row20-21 expected 3's+4's but generated empty; upper row5-6 partial but no full tiers filled; suggests H=2 detection failed, or steps wrong (alternating H+1=3,H+2=4 but grid has gaps of 3-4 rows).
 * Train 3: Generated filled row6 with 4 at col3 (from signal?), but expected no; extra fills in row15-16 with wrong colors (2 instead of 3 for left bar).
 * Overall: find_existing_k always defaults to 1 (only checks signal_rows[kk] col0 == existing_colors[0]), ignoring multi-color matching; compute_tier_starts has placeholder step_row=5 if N==2 else 0 (broken for N>2); get_signal_cols fixed to [1,3] +5 if signals, but doesn't extend further for N>3; get_global_bar_starts extends only if M<N but uses fixed steps, may not match signal positions; get_tier_colors assumes signal_cols match N but skips None; no handling for multiple existing tiers or non-bottom existing; fill uses w=H but only if square.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it includes partial/incomplete fills that don't match expected patterns from trainings (e.g., rows 5-8 have irregular 1's at cols13-16 +19-22 +23-26? but sparse and not full HxH bars; rows 10-13 have 4's at13-16 +2's at18-21 +23-26 full 4 rows, suggesting H=4 detected; rows 16-19 empty but expected perhaps 1's+4's at13-16+18-21+23-26; rows 21-24 have 8's at13-16 but only 4 rows? and no right bars; extra 8 at row7 col1, and row5-8 partial 1's not contiguous/full).
 * Test has wider grid (27 cols), signals in cols1,3,5,6? (row1:1 at1,3,5; row3:4 at1,3 +2 at5; row5:1 at1,3 +4 at3? wait row5:1 at1,3,4 at3? output row5:1,4 at1,3; but signals extend?); generated filled some but missed upper/lower tiers (e.g., no fills around row20+ for potential 8's from signal? row21 has 8 at1 but not bar); bars not extended to 4 positions (only 3?); positions misaligned (e.g., bars start at col13? not matching signals at1,3,5); overall, looks like partial detection (H=4 from rows10-13?) but wrong k=1 assumption, bad steps (gaps not alternating 5/6), and overfill (e.g., row7 col1=8 ≠3 bg).

[2025-10-02 08:28:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 08:39:38] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]

def get_levels(n: int) -> List[int]:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:41:37] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color and sparse non-background patterns in "upper levels" (specific odd-numbered rows), where the goal is to identify a "seed" block structure from a uniform repeating pattern in the lower half of the grid and replicate that block structure at offset positions corresponding to other upper levels, using colors derived from those levels, but only if the target area is empty (background only).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all placements must respect this and not overwrite existing non-background cells.
 * Upper levels are computed as odd rows starting from 1 (e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to roughly n/6 levels); non-background columns in these levels define "upper_cols", and their colors are extracted per level.
 * Seed block is the tallest (maximum height h) uniform horizontal pattern (set of columns with non-bg) found in the lower half (starting from row n//2), where uniformity means the exact same column set repeats vertically for h rows.
 * Lower groups are consecutive runs of columns in the seed pattern (e.g., [0,1,2] or [4,5]), treated as "blocks" to fill with a single color each.
 * Seed matching: Find the upper level k whose colors (from upper_cols) best match the colors in the seed's blocks (B blocks, mapped to S upper_cols, with special skipping for B=2 S=3: first block to col 0, second to col 2).
 * Replication: For each other level j != k, compute position s_j = seed_start + (j - k) * 5; if s_j is within bounds, the area is fully background, and h fits, fill the block groups with colors from upper_colors[j], using the same mapping.
 * Subtlety: Interval is fixed at 5 rows between placements; placements can go above or below seed (positive/negative delta), but only if empty; no overwriting existing content.
 * Special case handling for mismatched B and S (e.g., B=2 S=3 skips middle column); blocks must be uniformly colored in seed for matching.
 * Easy to miss: Seed search starts from n//2 downwards? No, code searches r_start from n//2 to n-1, extending down only; patterns are horizontal sets, not shapes; if no seed or no match, return original grid unchanged.
 * Grid size n x n (square); rows/cols 0-indexed; ensure bounds checks (c < n, rr < n).
 * Unhelpful: Flat counter for bg is fine, but over-relying on fixed interval=5 without verifying per-example; seed height computation breaks if pattern skips rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing patterns and checking emptiness.)

```python
def find_seed_block(g: List[List[int]], n: int, bg: int) -> tuple:
    max_h = 0
    best_start = -1
    best_pat = set()
    for r_start in range(n // 2, n):
        pat = {c for c in range(n) if g[r_start][c] != bg}
        if not pat:
            continue
        h = 1
        r = r_start + 1
        while r < n:
            pat_r = {c for c in range(n) if g[r][c] != bg}
            if pat_r == pat:
                h += 1
                r += 1
            else:
                break
        if h > max_h:
            max_h = h
            best_start = r_start
            best_pat = pat
    return best_start, max_h, best_pat
```
(This finds the tallest uniform repeating column pattern in the lower half, key for identifying the block structure to replicate; useful but limited to downward extension only.)

```python
def get_lower_groups(pat_set: set, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not pat_set:
        return []
    cl = sorted(pat_set)
    groups = []
    if not cl:
        return groups
    curr_start = cl[0]
    prev = cl[0]
    for i in range(1, len(cl)):
        if cl[i] == prev + 1:
            prev = cl[i]
        else:
            group = list(range(curr_start, prev + 1))
            if all(0 <= c < n for c in group):
                groups.append(group)
            curr_start = cl[i]
            prev = cl[i]
    group = list(range(curr_start, prev + 1))
    if all(0 <= c < n for c in group):
        groups.append(group)
    return groups
```
(This groups consecutive columns into fillable blocks; helpful for defining what to color uniformly, but assumes contiguous runs only.)

```python
def is_position_empty(g: List[List[int]], s_j: int, h: int, n: int, lower_pos: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    all_pos = [c for pos in lower_pos for c in pos if 0 <= c < n]
    for rr in range(s_j, s_j + h):
        if rr >= n:
            return False
        for c in all_pos:
            if g[rr][c] != bg:
                return False
    return True
```
(This checks if the target replication area is fully background; critical to avoid overwriting, but flattens all block positions—works if blocks don't overlap.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated kept original upper patterns (4's in rows 1-3) and seed 1's in row 5, but failed to replicate the 1's block (3-high, columns 1,3? but expected shows wider blocks like cols 8-10 and 13-15 with 1's) at offset positions (e.g., rows 11-13); instead, rows 6-22 are mostly empty except original, missing the expected 1's blocks in rows 6-8 and 11-13—likely due to wrong level count (only 3 levels:1,3,5), wrong seed detection (didn't find/capture the wider block structure), or failed emptiness/match for lower placements; special B=2 S=3 mapping not applied correctly, leading to no fills below row 5.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated preserved original patterns (2's in row1/4-5, 1's/3's scattered), added nothing new except possibly misplaced 2's, but expected adds 1's blocks in rows 7-9 (cols 10-12,16-18? wait, cols10,12? but expected shows cols10-11,16-17 with 1's, and 3's in cols16-17 rows10-11,14-15); missed replicating the seed (likely the 2's block in rows4-5, cols10-12? 10,12? no, expected 10,11? wait) with offsets, placing 1's/3's incorrectly or not at all—problems with seed start (found but h=1 or mismatch), interval=5 not aligning (e.g., expected placements at rows7-9= +3? not 5), or color mapping wrong (used upper colors but skipped wrong indices); also, lower 3's in cols16-17 not filled properly.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): Successfully detected seed, matched to an upper level, and replicated blocks at correct offsets with matching colors, filling empty areas without overwrites—demonstrates core logic works for cases with simple B/S alignment and sufficient space/levels.
 * Overall: Fixed interval=5 works for train3 but fails train1/2 (expected offsets seem ~5-6 but with more levels needed: code's L=(n-1)//6 limits to 3-4 levels for n=23/27, but expected has placements up to row23, implying more levels like every odd row or different computation); seed finder good for uniform horizontal but misses if pattern has gaps or isn't tallest; matching logic with special B=2 S=3 helps some cases but caused skips in train1; emptiness check prevented some overwrites but blocked valid fills; get_upper_cols/colors useful for extracting patterns but assumes levels only up to 5-7, missing higher ones.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_levels((n-1)//6) undercounts levels (e.g., for n=23, only [1,3,5] but expected uses up to row21?); find_k_seed's uniform check assumes all blocks uniform in seed, but if seed has mixed colors it fails entirely (though examples seem uniform); set_level fills per block but doesn't handle non-contiguous groups well if pat_set has gaps (get_lower_groups assumes contiguous only, breaking spaced patterns like cols1,3).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially preserves original patterns (e.g., scattered 1's/4's/2's in upper rows 1,3,5,6; 8 in row7; 1's block in row8 cols13-17,19-22? but listed as 13-16,19-22 with 1's separated by 3's? wait, [3,3,...,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,...] so two 4-wide 1's blocks separated) and adds replications: 4's/2's blocks (4-wide each, separated) in rows10-13 cols13-16/19-22; 1's same in row18; 8's block in row23 cols13-16 (but 8 is bg? wait, bg=3, 8 is non-bg, placed as [8,8,8,8,3,...] but expected likely shouldn't place bg-colored blocks).
 * Does not look fully correct: Placements seem to replicate a wide block structure (two 4-col groups separated by bg), using upper colors (e.g., row8 uses 1's matching some upper? but uppers have 1/4/2 scattered, not blocks; row10-13 uses 4/2 matching level? but h=4? original seed h unknown), but offsets are +2 (row8 to10), then repeat, not consistent *5; row18 (+8 from10?) and row23 (+5 from18) irregular; row7 has lone 8 at col1, row6 has 1/4/1, but no replication there—suggests seed found around row6-7 but matching failed for some j, or levels miscomputed (n=27, L=4 [1,3,5,7], but placements go to row23 implying more levels needed); also, row9/14-17/19-22 empty where expected might fill based on higher "levels" (e.g., if levels every odd row, missing odds like 9,11,...21); overfilled row23 with non-bg 8's where space might not be empty or match wrong; core issue: doesn't fully replicate across all possible offsets, leaving gaps (e.g., no block around row 0-3 or 14-17), and block widths (4+4) match a possible seed but colors (1 in row8,4/2 in10-13,1 in18,8 in23) don't consistently derive from sequential upper levels—looks like partial matching but wrong level selection or interval.

[2025-10-02 08:41:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents a multi-tiered structure (like a tower or building) with colored square bars of uniform height H arranged horizontally across signal columns, where "signal rows" indicate the color assignments for each tier level (k), and the goal is to detect an existing partial tier, infer missing tier positions and colors, and fill in the background-only areas of those bars without overwriting existing content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is always the dominant color (e.g., 8 in examples 1-2, 1 in example 3, 3 in test), typically filling most of the grid; signals and bars use distinct colors ≠ bg.
 * Signal rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-based) that contain non-bg signals in specific columns (1,3,5 initially, but extensible); these rows encode tier colors for levels k=1 to T via positions in signal columns.
 * Signal columns start as [1,3] (or [1,3,5] if signals present), but can extend rightward in steps (e.g., +5 for N=2, or H+1 otherwise) to match the number of bars N in an existing tier; colors in signal rows at these columns define the palette for that tier.
 * Existing tiers are contiguous blocks of H identical rows with vertical square bars (width=height=H, non-bg color) separated by bg; detection requires finding such a block with at least one bar, then using its bar starts, colors, and position to anchor computations.
 * Tier positions (starts) are computed relative to the existing tier's level k: above uses upward steps (alternating small_step=H+1 and large_step=H+2, but reversed for prev_k), below uses downward steps similarly; for N=2 (two bars), fixed delta=5; gaps between tiers must fit within grid bounds without overlap.
 * Horizontal bar extension: If existing tier has M < N bars, extend rightward from the last bar_start by step_col (5 for N=2, H+1 otherwise) to reach N positions; fill each bar as a HxH square only on bg cells, using the color from signal row for that k and bar j.
 * Subtleties: Tier height H must match bar width exactly for detection; multiple identical rows count toward height; if no existing tier, do nothing; signals may be sparse (None if bg), skipping fills for missing colors; for N>2, signal cols include 5 only if signals present; tier numbering k starts at 1 (bottom-up? but code assumes signal_rows[0] is k=1); in example 3, bg=1 but signals use 2,3,4; test has wider grid (27 cols) with more complex signals/bars.
 * Edge cases: T=0 (no signals, unchanged grid); out-of-bounds tiers skipped; partial signals (e.g., only left bars signaled); existing tier may not be at k=1; bars don't overlap signals or existing content; in test, multiple tier groups (e.g., rows 5-8 partial fill with 1's, rows 10-13 with 4/2, rows 16-19 empty?, rows 21-24 with 8? but incomplete).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core issues in tier positioning, color assignment, or extension logic.
 * Train 1: Detected existing tier at rows 1-3 (H=3? but signals suggest H=1? wait, code detects H from contiguous rows) with 4's, but failed to fill lower tier at rows 6-8 with 1's (three rows of 1's in cols 8-10 and 13-15) and upper at 11-13; generated left signals/bars untouched but no new fills; expected has full 3-row bars of 1's in those positions, suggesting missed computation of tier_starts for k=2,3 with steps.
 * Train 1: Also no extension to third bar position (cols ~18-20?); existing has two bars of 4's (cols 8-10,13-15), but signals include col 5? with no fill.
 * Train 2: Detected partial fills (e.g., row 4 has 1's at 1,3; row 5 has 2's at 10-11,14-15 but incomplete), but missed full tiers: expected has rows 7-8 with 1's at 10-11,14-15; rows 10-11 with 1's + 3's at 16-17; rows 13-14 with 1's + 3's; generated has sparse 2's/1's/3's but no contiguous 2-row (H=2?) bars, and extra 3 at row5 col5; suggests wrong H detection (maybe H=1 or 2), incorrect k assignment, or bad step deltas (used 5 for N=2 but perhaps not).
 * Train 2: Signal rows detected as [1,3,7,9?] but code stops at first empty, missing lower signals; generated has no fills below row6, but expected extends to row14.
 * Train 3: Bg=1, signals in odd rows with 2,3,4 at cols1,3,5; detected some bars (e.g., row15-16 with 2's at11-12 +3's at16-17? but generated has them, wait no—generated has row15-16: 2's at11-12,1's? wait, output shows row15:1's bg with 2,2 at11-12,3,3 at16-17 but messed up positions; expected has row10-11:2's at11-12,3's at16-17; row15-16:3's at11-12,3's at16-17? wait, expected row15-16:3's at11-12 +3's at16-17, but generated has wrong colors/placements (e.g., row15 has 2's and 3's but also 1's bg); lower row20-21 expected 3's+4's but generated empty; upper row5-6 partial but no full tiers filled; suggests H=2 detection failed, or steps wrong (alternating H+1=3,H+2=4 but grid has gaps of 3-4 rows).
 * Train 3: Generated filled row6 with 4 at col3 (from signal?), but expected no; extra fills in row15-16 with wrong colors (2 instead of 3 for left bar).
 * Overall: find_existing_k always defaults to 1 (only checks signal_rows[kk] col0 == existing_colors[0]), ignoring multi-color matching; compute_tier_starts has placeholder step_row=5 if N==2 else 0 (broken for N>2); get_signal_cols fixed to [1,3] +5 if signals, but doesn't extend further for N>3; get_global_bar_starts extends only if M<N but uses fixed steps, may not match signal positions; get_tier_colors assumes signal_cols match N but skips None; no handling for multiple existing tiers or non-bottom existing; fill uses w=H but only if square.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it includes partial/incomplete fills that don't match expected patterns from trainings (e.g., rows 5-8 have irregular 1's at cols13-16 +19-22 +23-26? but sparse and not full HxH bars; rows 10-13 have 4's at13-16 +2's at18-21 +23-26 full 4 rows, suggesting H=4 detected; rows 16-19 empty but expected perhaps 1's+4's at13-16+18-21+23-26; rows 21-24 have 8's at13-16 but only 4 rows? and no right bars; extra 8 at row7 col1, and row5-8 partial 1's not contiguous/full).
 * Test has wider grid (27 cols), signals in cols1,3,5,6? (row1:1 at1,3,5; row3:4 at1,3 +2 at5; row5:1 at1,3 +4 at3? wait row5:1 at1,3,4 at3? output row5:1,4 at1,3; but signals extend?); generated filled some but missed upper/lower tiers (e.g., no fills around row20+ for potential 8's from signal? row21 has 8 at1 but not bar); bars not extended to 4 positions (only 3?); positions misaligned (e.g., bars start at col13? not matching signals at1,3,5); overall, looks like partial detection (H=4 from rows10-13?) but wrong k=1 assumption, bad steps (gaps not alternating 5/6), and overfill (e.g., row7 col1=8 ≠3 bg).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color and sparse non-background patterns in "upper levels" (specific odd-numbered rows), where the goal is to identify a "seed" block structure from a uniform repeating pattern in the lower half of the grid and replicate that block structure at offset positions corresponding to other upper levels, using colors derived from those levels, but only if the target area is empty (background only).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all placements must respect this and not overwrite existing non-background cells.
 * Upper levels are computed as odd rows starting from 1 (e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to roughly n/6 levels); non-background columns in these levels define "upper_cols", and their colors are extracted per level.
 * Seed block is the tallest (maximum height h) uniform horizontal pattern (set of columns with non-bg) found in the lower half (starting from row n//2), where uniformity means the exact same column set repeats vertically for h rows.
 * Lower groups are consecutive runs of columns in the seed pattern (e.g., [0,1,2] or [4,5]), treated as "blocks" to fill with a single color each.
 * Seed matching: Find the upper level k whose colors (from upper_cols) best match the colors in the seed's blocks (B blocks, mapped to S upper_cols, with special skipping for B=2 S=3: first block to col 0, second to col 2).
 * Replication: For each other level j != k, compute position s_j = seed_start + (j - k) * 5; if s_j is within bounds, the area is fully background, and h fits, fill the block groups with colors from upper_colors[j], using the same mapping.
 * Subtlety: Interval is fixed at 5 rows between placements; placements can go above or below seed (positive/negative delta), but only if empty; no overwriting existing content.
 * Special case handling for mismatched B and S (e.g., B=2 S=3 skips middle column); blocks must be uniformly colored in seed for matching.
 * Easy to miss: Seed search starts from n//2 downwards? No, code searches r_start from n//2 to n-1, extending down only; patterns are horizontal sets, not shapes; if no seed or no match, return original grid unchanged.
 * Grid size n x n (square); rows/cols 0-indexed; ensure bounds checks (c < n, rr < n).
 * Unhelpful: Flat counter for bg is fine, but over-relying on fixed interval=5 without verifying per-example; seed height computation breaks if pattern skips rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing patterns and checking emptiness.)

```python
def find_seed_block(g: List[List[int]], n: int, bg: int) -> tuple:
    max_h = 0
    best_start = -1
    best_pat = set()
    for r_start in range(n // 2, n):
        pat = {c for c in range(n) if g[r_start][c] != bg}
        if not pat:
            continue
        h = 1
        r = r_start + 1
        while r < n:
            pat_r = {c for c in range(n) if g[r][c] != bg}
            if pat_r == pat:
                h += 1
                r += 1
            else:
                break
        if h > max_h:
            max_h = h
            best_start = r_start
            best_pat = pat
    return best_start, max_h, best_pat
```
(This finds the tallest uniform repeating column pattern in the lower half, key for identifying the block structure to replicate; useful but limited to downward extension only.)

```python
def get_lower_groups(pat_set: set, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not pat_set:
        return []
    cl = sorted(pat_set)
    groups = []
    if not cl:
        return groups
    curr_start = cl[0]
    prev = cl[0]
    for i in range(1, len(cl)):
        if cl[i] == prev + 1:
            prev = cl[i]
        else:
            group = list(range(curr_start, prev + 1))
            if all(0 <= c < n for c in group):
                groups.append(group)
            curr_start = cl[i]
            prev = cl[i]
    group = list(range(curr_start, prev + 1))
    if all(0 <= c < n for c in group):
        groups.append(group)
    return groups
```
(This groups consecutive columns into fillable blocks; helpful for defining what to color uniformly, but assumes contiguous runs only.)

```python
def is_position_empty(g: List[List[int]], s_j: int, h: int, n: int, lower_pos: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    all_pos = [c for pos in lower_pos for c in pos if 0 <= c < n]
    for rr in range(s_j, s_j + h):
        if rr >= n:
            return False
        for c in all_pos:
            if g[rr][c] != bg:
                return False
    return True
```
(This checks if the target replication area is fully background; critical to avoid overwriting, but flattens all block positions—works if blocks don't overlap.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated kept original upper patterns (4's in rows 1-3) and seed 1's in row 5, but failed to replicate the 1's block (3-high, columns 1,3? but expected shows wider blocks like cols 8-10 and 13-15 with 1's) at offset positions (e.g., rows 11-13); instead, rows 6-22 are mostly empty except original, missing the expected 1's blocks in rows 6-8 and 11-13—likely due to wrong level count (only 3 levels:1,3,5), wrong seed detection (didn't find/capture the wider block structure), or failed emptiness/match for lower placements; special B=2 S=3 mapping not applied correctly, leading to no fills below row 5.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated preserved original patterns (2's in row1/4-5, 1's/3's scattered), added nothing new except possibly misplaced 2's, but expected adds 1's blocks in rows 7-9 (cols 10-12,16-18? wait, cols10,12? but expected shows cols10-11,16-17 with 1's, and 3's in cols16-17 rows10-11,14-15); missed replicating the seed (likely the 2's block in rows4-5, cols10-12? 10,12? no, expected 10,11? wait) with offsets, placing 1's/3's incorrectly or not at all—problems with seed start (found but h=1 or mismatch), interval=5 not aligning (e.g., expected placements at rows7-9= +3? not 5), or color mapping wrong (used upper colors but skipped wrong indices); also, lower 3's in cols16-17 not filled properly.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): Successfully detected seed, matched to an upper level, and replicated blocks at correct offsets with matching colors, filling empty areas without overwrites—demonstrates core logic works for cases with simple B/S alignment and sufficient space/levels.
 * Overall: Fixed interval=5 works for train3 but fails train1/2 (expected offsets seem ~5-6 but with more levels needed: code's L=(n-1)//6 limits to 3-4 levels for n=23/27, but expected has placements up to row23, implying more levels like every odd row or different computation); seed finder good for uniform horizontal but misses if pattern has gaps or isn't tallest; matching logic with special B=2 S=3 helps some cases but caused skips in train1; emptiness check prevented some overwrites but blocked valid fills; get_upper_cols/colors useful for extracting patterns but assumes levels only up to 5-7, missing higher ones.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_levels((n-1)//6) undercounts levels (e.g., for n=23, only [1,3,5] but expected uses up to row21?); find_k_seed's uniform check assumes all blocks uniform in seed, but if seed has mixed colors it fails entirely (though examples seem uniform); set_level fills per block but doesn't handle non-contiguous groups well if pat_set has gaps (get_lower_groups assumes contiguous only, breaking spaced patterns like cols1,3).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially preserves original patterns (e.g., scattered 1's/4's/2's in upper rows 1,3,5,6; 8 in row7; 1's block in row8 cols13-17,19-22? but listed as 13-16,19-22 with 1's separated by 3's? wait, [3,3,...,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,...] so two 4-wide 1's blocks separated) and adds replications: 4's/2's blocks (4-wide each, separated) in rows10-13 cols13-16/19-22; 1's same in row18; 8's block in row23 cols13-16 (but 8 is bg? wait, bg=3, 8 is non-bg, placed as [8,8,8,8,3,...] but expected likely shouldn't place bg-colored blocks).
 * Does not look fully correct: Placements seem to replicate a wide block structure (two 4-col groups separated by bg), using upper colors (e.g., row8 uses 1's matching some upper? but uppers have 1/4/2 scattered, not blocks; row10-13 uses 4/2 matching level? but h=4? original seed h unknown), but offsets are +2 (row8 to10), then repeat, not consistent *5; row18 (+8 from10?) and row23 (+5 from18) irregular; row7 has lone 8 at col1, row6 has 1/4/1, but no replication there—suggests seed found around row6-7 but matching failed for some j, or levels miscomputed (n=27, L=4 [1,3,5,7], but placements go to row23 implying more levels needed); also, row9/14-17/19-22 empty where expected might fill based on higher "levels" (e.g., if levels every odd row, missing odds like 9,11,...21); overfilled row23 with non-bg 8's where space might not be empty or match wrong; core issue: doesn't fully replicate across all possible offsets, leaving gaps (e.g., no block around row 0-3 or 14-17), and block widths (4+4) match a possible seed but colors (1 in row8,4/2 in10-13,1 in18,8 in23) don't consistently derive from sequential upper levels—looks like partial matching but wrong level selection or interval.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:54:58] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a square grid with a background color and sparse "signal" patterns (colored cells in specific positions, often in odd-indexed rows) that represent incomplete horizontal bars or tiers of uniform-width colored segments. The goal is to detect an existing complete tier, infer its structure (bar positions, widths, colors, spacing), match it to signals, and propagate filling of missing bars both within that tier and to new tiers above/below based on signal lists, while respecting grid boundaries and only filling background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells, never existing non-background ones.
 * Signals are non-background cells in odd rows (1-based? code uses 0-based range(1, rows, 2)), at odd columns; they represent the colors of bars in tiers, but positions are relative and need alignment to the detected tier's bar starts.
 * Tiers are horizontal bands of repeated rows with uniform-width bars (all bars in a tier have the same width, separated by consistent background gaps); detect the first such existing tier with at least one bar to use as a template for structure (starts, spacing=step_col, width=bar_w).
 * Existing tier's height (h) may not equal the inferred tier height (tier_h = bar_w); code sets tier_h = bar_w, but this might be wrong if tiers have different heights.
 * Match the existing tier's bar colors to a subsequence in a signal list to identify k_existing (the signal level it corresponds to); if no match, do nothing.
 * For the matched level (k_existing), extend missing bars to the right if the signal has more colors than detected bars (M).
 * If the existing tier reaches the bottom (start_r + h -1 == n-1), check and fill a single-row tier above it only if the positions are background; but don't propagate further upward unless signals indicate more levels.
 * Propagate new tiers below: start from existing tier, step down by step_col (adjusted for first step if h != tier_h), but break if out of bounds; assign starts to signals below k_existing.
 * Propagate new tiers above: step up by step_col (with possible adjust_first=1 if reaches_bottom), but code has issues like current_start = start_r and subtracting, potentially overlapping or misaligning.
 * For new tiers, generate local bar starts by extending the existing bar_starts pattern with step_col if signal has more colors; fill each bar vertically for height=tier_h (not h) with the signal's colors.
 * Subtle: Signals may have varying numbers of colors (N_j), so tiers can have different numbers of bars; but all bars in a tier must use the same width and spacing from the template.
 * Grid is square (n x n), but bars don't span full width; ignore even rows/columns except for tier detection.
 * Potential overfilling: Code fills vertically for tier_h but uses h for existing; also, in train1, it incorrectly placed 4's in lower rows based on mismatched propagation.
 * Edge cases: No signals (T=0) or no existing tier returns original; M=0 or no match does nothing; assumes step_col from first two bars if M>=2, else bar_w +1 (may be wrong if single bar).
 * Only fill if positions are background; code has can_fill check for top but not generally for new tiers, risking overwrites.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all fills and signal detection.)

```python
def get_signal_list(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[int], List[int]]]:
    signal_list = []
    for r in range(1, rows, 2):
        sig_cols = [c for c in range(1, cols, 2) if grid[r][c] != bg]
        if sig_cols:
            colors = [grid[r][c] for c in sig_cols]
            signal_list.append((r, colors, sig_cols))
    return signal_list
```
(This extracts signals from odd rows and odd columns, capturing colors and positions; useful for identifying tier levels, but note sig_cols may not align directly to bar starts—relative matching needed.)

```python
def detect_existing_tier(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, List[int], List[int], int, int]]:
    i = 0
    while i < rows:
        pattern = tuple(grid[i])
        j = i + 1
        while j < rows and tuple(grid[j]) == pattern:
            j += 1
        height = j - i
        if height < 1:
            i = j
            continue
        bars = []
        c = 0
        while c < cols:
            if pattern[c] == bg:
                c += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[c]
            start = c
            while c < cols and pattern[c] == color:
                c += 1
            width = c - start
            bars.append((start, width, color))
        if bars:
            widths = [b[1] for b in bars]
            if len(set(widths)) == 1:
                bar_w = widths[0]
                bar_starts = [b[0] for b in bars]
                bar_colors = [b[2] for b in bars]
                M = len(bars)
                return height, i, bar_starts, bar_colors, M, bar_w
        i = j
    return None
```
(This detects the first repeated-row tier with uniform bar widths, extracting structure; core to templating, but assumes first such tier is the reference—may need to choose the most complete or matching one.)

```python
def fill_if_background(grid: List[List[int]], r_start: int, c_start: int, h: int, w: int, color: int, bg: int, rows: int, cols: int):
    for dr in range(h):
        r = r_start + dr
        if not (0 <= r < rows):
            continue
        for dc in range(w):
            c = c_start + dc
            if 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] == bg:
                grid[r][c] = color
```
(This safely fills rectangular bars only on background; essential to avoid overwriting signals or existing parts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating the program partially understands tier detection and signal extraction but mishandles propagation, height assumptions, and alignment.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 4,4,4 bars in rows 5-7 (0-based indices 5-7, positions 18-20) and row 2 (index 2, positions 8-10), which shouldn't be there; expected has only 1's in row 5 positions 1,3 and blanks elsewhere in lower signals, plus a single-row 1's tier in rows 6-8 but shifted; code over-propagated from k_existing (likely the 4's tier in rows 1-3) downward without matching heights or stopping at signals.
 * Train 1 also incorrectly filled row 10-12 with 1's (positions 8-10,13-15) but expected has them in rows 11-13 and 15-17? Wait, grids are 23x23? Mismatch in lower tiers; unknown why it placed 4's in row 5 instead of leaving blank or filling 1's correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated missing the 1's bars in row 7 (index 7, expected positions 10-11,13-14), 3's in row 10 (index 10, positions 16-17), and full propagation to rows 14-15 with 3's; instead placed 2's incorrectly in row 5 and 1's in row 7 partially; code likely miscalculated starts_dict for above/below, using wrong step_col or tier_h=bar_w (here bar_w=1? but signals have wider).
 * Train 2 also has extra 2's in row 5 positions 10-11,14-15, but expected has them only in row 4; downward fill for 1's tier didn't extend colors correctly, and no 3's added in upper tiers.
 * Train 3: Generated misplaced 3,3 and 4,4 in row 20 (index 20, positions 11-12,16-17) but expected has 2,2 and 3,3 in row 10; also no fills in rows 7-8 or 15-16 where expected has blanks or partial; code detected wrong existing tier (perhaps the single 3/4 signals as bars) and propagated with wrong step_col, filling bottom instead of mid-grid.
 * Train 3 has all rows as single-height except detected, but expected has multi-row blanks and specific placements; function detect_existing_tier may return None or wrong h if no repeated rows, leading to no fills.
 * Overall, matching k_existing works sometimes (e.g., detects 4's in train1), but propagation misaligns starts (e.g., step_col wrong if gaps vary), uses tier_h=bar_w incorrectly (tiers seem height=1 or 3 in examples), and overfills without checking bounds/can_fill for new tiers.
 * fill_if_background is helpful and correct (no overwrites seen), but get_signal_list assumes odd rows/cols—may miss if signals in even.
 * detect_existing_tier is mostly helpful but skips if no uniform widths or repeated rows; in train3 (bg=1, sparse), it may not detect any tier, doing nothing.
 * The main program logic for starts_dict has bugs: below uses adj = max(0, tier_h - h) which is 0 if tier_h=bar_w=h, but examples suggest variable heights; above adjust_first=1 only if reaches_bottom, but train1 reaches bottom yet didn't fill top correctly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the k_existing matching loop assumes exact subsequence match—may fail if signals have extra/missing; step_col fallback to bar_w+1 if M<2 is arbitrary and wrong if single bar.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills and misaligns bars, e.g., row 9 (0-based index 9) has 4,4,2 but original has only sparse 4,2 signals in row 3/5/9, suggesting wrong propagation from detected tier (likely rows 9-12 with 4's and 2's as existing, bar_w=1 or 4?).
 * Extra wide 4,4,4,4 (positions 13-16) and 2,2,2,2 (18-21) in rows 10-13, but expected likely narrower bars aligned to signals (e.g., odd cols like 1,3,5,13?,21?); code extended local_starts incorrectly for N_j > M.
 * Row 7 has 8 (non-bg?) at col1, but original row7 is all bg except perhaps signals—no 8's in input, so possible overwrite bug; lower half (rows 14+) all bg, but if propagating up from bottom signals, should fill partial tiers like in train2/3.
 * No fills in upper signals (rows 1,3,5) beyond original, but expected should extend missing bars (e.g., row1 has 1 at col1,3,5—fill vertical?); propagation below seems to have skipped or misstepped, leaving rows 0-8 mostly original + extras.
 * Test has wider grid (27x27?), more bars (M>4?), varying colors (1,2,4,8); code's step_col from bar_starts[1]-bar_starts[0] may fail if irregular spacing; looks like it detected a tier around row9-12 but used wrong tier_h (filled h=4? for rows10-13), and didn't match k_existing properly (signals in odd rows 1,3,5,9?).

[2025-10-02 08:54:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a square grid with a background color and sparse "signal" patterns (colored cells in specific positions, often in odd-indexed rows) that represent incomplete horizontal bars or tiers of uniform-width colored segments. The goal is to detect an existing complete tier, infer its structure (bar positions, widths, colors, spacing), match it to signals, and propagate filling of missing bars both within that tier and to new tiers above/below based on signal lists, while respecting grid boundaries and only filling background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the grid; all fills must only overwrite background cells, never existing non-background ones.
 * Signals are non-background cells in odd rows (1-based? code uses 0-based range(1, rows, 2)), at odd columns; they represent the colors of bars in tiers, but positions are relative and need alignment to the detected tier's bar starts.
 * Tiers are horizontal bands of repeated rows with uniform-width bars (all bars in a tier have the same width, separated by consistent background gaps); detect the first such existing tier with at least one bar to use as a template for structure (starts, spacing=step_col, width=bar_w).
 * Existing tier's height (h) may not equal the inferred tier height (tier_h = bar_w); code sets tier_h = bar_w, but this might be wrong if tiers have different heights.
 * Match the existing tier's bar colors to a subsequence in a signal list to identify k_existing (the signal level it corresponds to); if no match, do nothing.
 * For the matched level (k_existing), extend missing bars to the right if the signal has more colors than detected bars (M).
 * If the existing tier reaches the bottom (start_r + h -1 == n-1), check and fill a single-row tier above it only if the positions are background; but don't propagate further upward unless signals indicate more levels.
 * Propagate new tiers below: start from existing tier, step down by step_col (adjusted for first step if h != tier_h), but break if out of bounds; assign starts to signals below k_existing.
 * Propagate new tiers above: step up by step_col (with possible adjust_first=1 if reaches_bottom), but code has issues like current_start = start_r and subtracting, potentially overlapping or misaligning.
 * For new tiers, generate local bar starts by extending the existing bar_starts pattern with step_col if signal has more colors; fill each bar vertically for height=tier_h (not h) with the signal's colors.
 * Subtle: Signals may have varying numbers of colors (N_j), so tiers can have different numbers of bars; but all bars in a tier must use the same width and spacing from the template.
 * Grid is square (n x n), but bars don't span full width; ignore even rows/columns except for tier detection.
 * Potential overfilling: Code fills vertically for tier_h but uses h for existing; also, in train1, it incorrectly placed 4's in lower rows based on mismatched propagation.
 * Edge cases: No signals (T=0) or no existing tier returns original; M=0 or no match does nothing; assumes step_col from first two bars if M>=2, else bar_w +1 (may be wrong if single bar).
 * Only fill if positions are background; code has can_fill check for top but not generally for new tiers, risking overwrites.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all fills and signal detection.)

```python
def get_signal_list(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[int], List[int]]]:
    signal_list = []
    for r in range(1, rows, 2):
        sig_cols = [c for c in range(1, cols, 2) if grid[r][c] != bg]
        if sig_cols:
            colors = [grid[r][c] for c in sig_cols]
            signal_list.append((r, colors, sig_cols))
    return signal_list
```
(This extracts signals from odd rows and odd columns, capturing colors and positions; useful for identifying tier levels, but note sig_cols may not align directly to bar starts—relative matching needed.)

```python
def detect_existing_tier(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, List[int], List[int], int, int]]:
    i = 0
    while i < rows:
        pattern = tuple(grid[i])
        j = i + 1
        while j < rows and tuple(grid[j]) == pattern:
            j += 1
        height = j - i
        if height < 1:
            i = j
            continue
        bars = []
        c = 0
        while c < cols:
            if pattern[c] == bg:
                c += 1
                continue
            color = pattern[c]
            start = c
            while c < cols and pattern[c] == color:
                c += 1
            width = c - start
            bars.append((start, width, color))
        if bars:
            widths = [b[1] for b in bars]
            if len(set(widths)) == 1:
                bar_w = widths[0]
                bar_starts = [b[0] for b in bars]
                bar_colors = [b[2] for b in bars]
                M = len(bars)
                return height, i, bar_starts, bar_colors, M, bar_w
        i = j
    return None
```
(This detects the first repeated-row tier with uniform bar widths, extracting structure; core to templating, but assumes first such tier is the reference—may need to choose the most complete or matching one.)

```python
def fill_if_background(grid: List[List[int]], r_start: int, c_start: int, h: int, w: int, color: int, bg: int, rows: int, cols: int):
    for dr in range(h):
        r = r_start + dr
        if not (0 <= r < rows):
            continue
        for dc in range(w):
            c = c_start + dc
            if 0 <= c < cols and grid[r][c] == bg:
                grid[r][c] = color
```
(This safely fills rectangular bars only on background; essential to avoid overwriting signals or existing parts.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating the program partially understands tier detection and signal extraction but mishandles propagation, height assumptions, and alignment.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 4,4,4 bars in rows 5-7 (0-based indices 5-7, positions 18-20) and row 2 (index 2, positions 8-10), which shouldn't be there; expected has only 1's in row 5 positions 1,3 and blanks elsewhere in lower signals, plus a single-row 1's tier in rows 6-8 but shifted; code over-propagated from k_existing (likely the 4's tier in rows 1-3) downward without matching heights or stopping at signals.
 * Train 1 also incorrectly filled row 10-12 with 1's (positions 8-10,13-15) but expected has them in rows 11-13 and 15-17? Wait, grids are 23x23? Mismatch in lower tiers; unknown why it placed 4's in row 5 instead of leaving blank or filling 1's correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated missing the 1's bars in row 7 (index 7, expected positions 10-11,13-14), 3's in row 10 (index 10, positions 16-17), and full propagation to rows 14-15 with 3's; instead placed 2's incorrectly in row 5 and 1's in row 7 partially; code likely miscalculated starts_dict for above/below, using wrong step_col or tier_h=bar_w (here bar_w=1? but signals have wider).
 * Train 2 also has extra 2's in row 5 positions 10-11,14-15, but expected has them only in row 4; downward fill for 1's tier didn't extend colors correctly, and no 3's added in upper tiers.
 * Train 3: Generated misplaced 3,3 and 4,4 in row 20 (index 20, positions 11-12,16-17) but expected has 2,2 and 3,3 in row 10; also no fills in rows 7-8 or 15-16 where expected has blanks or partial; code detected wrong existing tier (perhaps the single 3/4 signals as bars) and propagated with wrong step_col, filling bottom instead of mid-grid.
 * Train 3 has all rows as single-height except detected, but expected has multi-row blanks and specific placements; function detect_existing_tier may return None or wrong h if no repeated rows, leading to no fills.
 * Overall, matching k_existing works sometimes (e.g., detects 4's in train1), but propagation misaligns starts (e.g., step_col wrong if gaps vary), uses tier_h=bar_w incorrectly (tiers seem height=1 or 3 in examples), and overfills without checking bounds/can_fill for new tiers.
 * fill_if_background is helpful and correct (no overwrites seen), but get_signal_list assumes odd rows/cols—may miss if signals in even.
 * detect_existing_tier is mostly helpful but skips if no uniform widths or repeated rows; in train3 (bg=1, sparse), it may not detect any tier, doing nothing.

 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the k_existing matching loop assumes exact subsequence match—may fail if signals have extra/missing; step_col fallback to bar_w+1 if M<2 is arbitrary and wrong if single bar.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills and misaligns bars, e.g., row 9 (0-based index 9) has 4,4,2 but original has only sparse 4,2 signals in row 3/5/9, suggesting wrong propagation from detected tier (likely rows 9-12 with 4's and 2's as existing, bar_w=1 or 4?).
 * Extra wide 4,4,4,4 (positions 13-16) and 2,2,2,2 (18-21) in rows 10-13, but expected likely narrower bars aligned to signals (e.g., odd cols like 1,3,5,13?,21?); code extended local_starts incorrectly for N_j > M.
 * Row 7 has 8 (non-bg?) at col1, but original row7 is all bg except perhaps signals—no 8's in input, so possible overwrite bug; lower half (rows 14+) all bg, but if propagating up from bottom signals, should fill partial tiers like in train2/3.
 * No fills in upper signals (rows 1,3,5) beyond original, but expected should extend missing bars (e.g., row1 has 1 at col1,3,5—fill vertical?); propagation below seems to have skipped or misstepped, leaving rows 0-8 mostly original + extras.
 * Test has wider grid (27x27?), more bars (M>4?), varying colors (1,2,4,8); code's step_col from bar_starts[1]-bar_starts[0] may fail if irregular spacing; looks like it detected a tier around row9-12 but used wrong tier_h (filled h=4? for rows10-13), and didn't match k_existing properly (signals in odd rows 1,3,5,9?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid that represents a multi-tiered structure (like a tower or building) with colored square bars of uniform height H arranged horizontally across signal columns, where "signal rows" indicate the color assignments for each tier level (k), and the goal is to detect an existing partial tier, infer missing tier positions and colors, and fill in the background-only areas of those bars without overwriting existing content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is always the dominant color (e.g., 8 in examples 1-2, 1 in example 3, 3 in test), typically filling most of the grid; signals and bars use distinct colors ≠ bg.
 * Signal rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-based) that contain non-bg signals in specific columns (1,3,5 initially, but extensible); these rows encode tier colors for levels k=1 to T via positions in signal columns.
 * Signal columns start as [1,3] (or [1,3,5] if signals present), but can extend rightward in steps (e.g., +5 for N=2, or H+1 otherwise) to match the number of bars N in an existing tier; colors in signal rows at these columns define the palette for that tier.
 * Existing tiers are contiguous blocks of H identical rows with vertical square bars (width=height=H, non-bg color) separated by bg; detection requires finding such a block with at least one bar, then using its bar starts, colors, and position to anchor computations.
 * Tier positions (starts) are computed relative to the existing tier's level k: above uses upward steps (alternating small_step=H+1 and large_step=H+2, but reversed for prev_k), below uses downward steps similarly; for N=2 (two bars), fixed delta=5; gaps between tiers must fit within grid bounds without overlap.
 * Horizontal bar extension: If existing tier has M < N bars, extend rightward from the last bar_start by step_col (5 for N=2, H+1 otherwise) to reach N positions; fill each bar as a HxH square only on bg cells, using the color from signal row for that k and bar j.
 * Subtleties: Tier height H must match bar width exactly for detection; multiple identical rows count toward height; if no existing tier, do nothing; signals may be sparse (None if bg), skipping fills for missing colors; for N>2, signal cols include 5 only if signals present; tier numbering k starts at 1 (bottom-up? but code assumes signal_rows[0] is k=1); in example 3, bg=1 but signals use 2,3,4; test has wider grid (27 cols) with more complex signals/bars.
 * Edge cases: T=0 (no signals, unchanged grid); out-of-bounds tiers skipped; partial signals (e.g., only left bars signaled); existing tier may not be at k=1; bars don't overlap signals or existing content; in test, multiple tier groups (e.g., rows 5-8 partial fill with 1's, rows 10-13 with 4/2, rows 16-19 empty?, rows 21-24 with 8? but incomplete).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core issues in tier positioning, color assignment, or extension logic.
 * Train 1: Detected existing tier at rows 1-3 (H=3? but signals suggest H=1? wait, code detects H from contiguous rows) with 4's, but failed to fill lower tier at rows 6-8 with 1's (three rows of 1's in cols 8-10 and 13-15) and upper at 11-13; generated left signals/bars untouched but no new fills; expected has full 3-row bars of 1's in those positions, suggesting missed computation of tier_starts for k=2,3 with steps.
 * Train 1: Also no extension to third bar position (cols ~18-20?); existing has two bars of 4's (cols 8-10,13-15), but signals include col 5? with no fill.
 * Train 2: Detected partial fills (e.g., row 4 has 1's at 1,3; row 5 has 2's at 10-11,14-15 but incomplete), but missed full tiers: expected has rows 7-8 with 1's at 10-11,14-15; rows 10-11 with 1's + 3's at 16-17; rows 13-14 with 1's + 3's; generated has sparse 2's/1's/3's but no contiguous 2-row (H=2?) bars, and extra 3 at row5 col5; suggests wrong H detection (maybe H=1 or 2), incorrect k assignment, or bad step deltas (used 5 for N=2 but perhaps not).
 * Train 2: Signal rows detected as [1,3,7,9?] but code stops at first empty, missing lower signals; generated has no fills below row6, but expected extends to row14.
 * Train 3: Bg=1, signals in odd rows with 2,3,4 at cols1,3,5; detected some bars (e.g., row15-16 with 2's at11-12 +3's at16-17? but generated has them, wait no—generated has row15-16: 2's at11-12,1's? wait, output shows row15:1's bg with 2,2 at11-12,3,3 at16-17 but messed up positions; expected has row10-11:2's at11-12,3's at16-17; row15-16:3's at11-12,3's at16-17? wait, expected row15-16:3's at11-12 +3's at16-17, but generated has wrong colors/placements (e.g., row15 has 2's and 3's but also 1's bg); lower row20-21 expected 3's+4's but generated empty; upper row5-6 partial but no full tiers filled; suggests H=2 detection failed, or steps wrong (alternating H+1=3,H+2=4 but grid has gaps of 3-4 rows).
 * Train 3: Generated filled row6 with 4 at col3 (from signal?), but expected no; extra fills in row15-16 with wrong colors (2 instead of 3 for left bar).
 * Overall: find_existing_k always defaults to 1 (only checks signal_rows[kk] col0 == existing_colors[0]), ignoring multi-color matching; compute_tier_starts has placeholder step_row=5 if N==2 else 0 (broken for N>2); get_signal_cols fixed to [1,3] +5 if signals, but doesn't extend further for N>3; get_global_bar_starts extends only if M<N but uses fixed steps, may not match signal positions; get_tier_colors assumes signal_cols match N but skips None; no handling for multiple existing tiers or non-bottom existing; fill uses w=H but only if square.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it includes partial/incomplete fills that don't match expected patterns from trainings (e.g., rows 5-8 have irregular 1's at cols13-16 +19-22 +23-26? but sparse and not full HxH bars; rows 10-13 have 4's at13-16 +2's at18-21 +23-26 full 4 rows, suggesting H=4 detected; rows 16-19 empty but expected perhaps 1's+4's at13-16+18-21+23-26; rows 21-24 have 8's at13-16 but only 4 rows? and no right bars; extra 8 at row7 col1, and row5-8 partial 1's not contiguous/full).
 * Test has wider grid (27 cols), signals in cols1,3,5,6? (row1:1 at1,3,5; row3:4 at1,3 +2 at5; row5:1 at1,3 +4 at3? wait row5:1 at1,3,4 at3? output row5:1,4 at1,3; but signals extend?); generated filled some but missed upper/lower tiers (e.g., no fills around row20+ for potential 8's from signal? row21 has 8 at1 but not bar); bars not extended to 4 positions (only 3?); positions misaligned (e.g., bars start at col13? not matching signals at1,3,5); overall, looks like partial detection (H=4 from rows10-13?) but wrong k=1 assumption, bad steps (gaps not alternating 5/6), and overfill (e.g., row7 col1=8 ≠3 bg).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color and sparse non-background patterns in "upper levels" (specific odd-numbered rows), where the goal is to identify a "seed" block structure from a uniform repeating pattern in the lower half of the grid and replicate that block structure at offset positions corresponding to other upper levels, using colors derived from those levels, but only if the target area is empty (background only).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the flattened grid; all placements must respect this and not overwrite existing non-background cells.
 * Upper levels are computed as odd rows starting from 1 (e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to roughly n/6 levels); non-background columns in these levels define "upper_cols", and their colors are extracted per level.
 * Seed block is the tallest (maximum height h) uniform horizontal pattern (set of columns with non-bg) found in the lower half (starting from row n//2), where uniformity means the exact same column set repeats vertically for h rows.
 * Lower groups are consecutive runs of columns in the seed pattern (e.g., [0,1,2] or [4,5]), treated as "blocks" to fill with a single color each.
 * Seed matching: Find the upper level k whose colors (from upper_cols) best match the colors in the seed's blocks (B blocks, mapped to S upper_cols, with special skipping for B=2 S=3: first block to col 0, second to col 2).
 * Replication: For each other level j != k, compute position s_j = seed_start + (j - k) * 5; if s_j is within bounds, the area is fully background, and h fits, fill the block groups with colors from upper_colors[j], using the same mapping.
 * Subtlety: Interval is fixed at 5 rows between placements; placements can go above or below seed (positive/negative delta), but only if empty; no overwriting existing content.
 * Special case handling for mismatched B and S (e.g., B=2 S=3 skips middle column); blocks must be uniformly colored in seed for matching.
 * Easy to miss: Seed search starts from n//2 downwards? No, code searches r_start from n//2 to n-1, extending down only; patterns are horizontal sets, not shapes; if no seed or no match, return original grid unchanged.
 * Grid size n x n (square); rows/cols 0-indexed; ensure bounds checks (c < n, rr < n).
 * Unhelpful: Flat counter for bg is fine, but over-relying on fixed interval=5 without verifying per-example; seed height computation breaks if pattern skips rows.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for distinguishing patterns and checking emptiness.)

```python
def find_seed_block(g: List[List[int]], n: int, bg: int) -> tuple:
    max_h = 0
    best_start = -1
    best_pat = set()
    for r_start in range(n // 2, n):
        pat = {c for c in range(n) if g[r_start][c] != bg}
        if not pat:
            continue
        h = 1
        r = r_start + 1
        while r < n:
            pat_r = {c for c in range(n) if g[r][c] != bg}
            if pat_r == pat:
                h += 1
                r += 1
            else:
                break
        if h > max_h:
            max_h = h
            best_start = r_start
            best_pat = pat
    return best_start, max_h, best_pat
```
(This finds the tallest uniform repeating column pattern in the lower half, key for identifying the block structure to replicate; useful but limited to downward extension only.)

```python
def get_lower_groups(pat_set: set, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not pat_set:
        return []
    cl = sorted(pat_set)
    groups = []
    if not cl:
        return groups
    curr_start = cl[0]
    prev = cl[0]
    for i in range(1, len(cl)):
        if cl[i] == prev + 1:
            prev = cl[i]
        else:
            group = list(range(curr_start, prev + 1))
            if all(0 <= c < n for c in group):
                groups.append(group)
            curr_start = cl[i]
            prev = cl[i]
    group = list(range(curr_start, prev + 1))
    if all(0 <= c < n for c in group):
        groups.append(group)
    return groups
```
(This groups consecutive columns into fillable blocks; helpful for defining what to color uniformly, but assumes contiguous runs only.)

```python
def is_position_empty(g: List[List[int]], s_j: int, h: int, n: int, lower_pos: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> bool:
    all_pos = [c for pos in lower_pos for c in pos if 0 <= c < n]
    for rr in range(s_j, s_j + h):
        if rr >= n:
            return False
        for c in all_pos:
            if g[rr][c] != bg:
                return False
    return True
```
(This checks if the target replication area is fully background; critical to avoid overwriting, but flattens all block positions—works if blocks don't overlap.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 (INCORRECT): Generated kept original upper patterns (4's in rows 1-3) and seed 1's in row 5, but failed to replicate the 1's block (3-high, columns 1,3? but expected shows wider blocks like cols 8-10 and 13-15 with 1's) at offset positions (e.g., rows 11-13); instead, rows 6-22 are mostly empty except original, missing the expected 1's blocks in rows 6-8 and 11-13—likely due to wrong level count (only 3 levels:1,3,5), wrong seed detection (didn't find/capture the wider block structure), or failed emptiness/match for lower placements; special B=2 S=3 mapping not applied correctly, leading to no fills below row 5.
 * Training example 2 (INCORRECT): Generated preserved original patterns (2's in row1/4-5, 1's/3's scattered), added nothing new except possibly misplaced 2's, but expected adds 1's blocks in rows 7-9 (cols 10-12,16-18? wait, cols10,12? but expected shows cols10-11,16-17 with 1's, and 3's in cols16-17 rows10-11,14-15); missed replicating the seed (likely the 2's block in rows4-5, cols10-12? 10,12? no, expected 10,11? wait) with offsets, placing 1's/3's incorrectly or not at all—problems with seed start (found but h=1 or mismatch), interval=5 not aligning (e.g., expected placements at rows7-9= +3? not 5), or color mapping wrong (used upper colors but skipped wrong indices); also, lower 3's in cols16-17 not filled properly.
 * Training example 3 (CORRECT): Successfully detected seed, matched to an upper level, and replicated blocks at correct offsets with matching colors, filling empty areas without overwrites—demonstrates core logic works for cases with simple B/S alignment and sufficient space/levels.
 * Overall: Fixed interval=5 works for train3 but fails train1/2 (expected offsets seem ~5-6 but with more levels needed: code's L=(n-1)//6 limits to 3-4 levels for n=23/27, but expected has placements up to row23, implying more levels like every odd row or different computation); seed finder good for uniform horizontal but misses if pattern has gaps or isn't tallest; matching logic with special B=2 S=3 helps some cases but caused skips in train1; emptiness check prevented some overwrites but blocked valid fills; get_upper_cols/colors useful for extracting patterns but assumes levels only up to 5-7, missing higher ones.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_levels((n-1)//6) undercounts levels (e.g., for n=23, only [1,3,5] but expected uses up to row21?); find_k_seed's uniform check assumes all blocks uniform in seed, but if seed has mixed colors it fails entirely (though examples seem uniform); set_level fills per block but doesn't handle non-contiguous groups well if pat_set has gaps (get_lower_groups assumes contiguous only, breaking spaced patterns like cols1,3).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially preserves original patterns (e.g., scattered 1's/4's/2's in upper rows 1,3,5,6; 8 in row7; 1's block in row8 cols13-17,19-22? but listed as 13-16,19-22 with 1's separated by 3's? wait, [3,3,...,1,1,1,1,3,1,1,1,1,3,3,...] so two 4-wide 1's blocks separated) and adds replications: 4's/2's blocks (4-wide each, separated) in rows10-13 cols13-16/19-22; 1's same in row18; 8's block in row23 cols13-16 (but 8 is bg? wait, bg=3, 8 is non-bg, placed as [8,8,8,8,3,...] but expected likely shouldn't place bg-colored blocks).
 * Does not look fully correct: Placements seem to replicate a wide block structure (two 4-col groups separated by bg), using upper colors (e.g., row8 uses 1's matching some upper? but uppers have 1/4/2 scattered, not blocks; row10-13 uses 4/2 matching level? but h=4? original seed h unknown), but offsets are +2 (row8 to10), then repeat, not consistent *5; row18 (+8 from10?) and row23 (+5 from18) irregular; row7 has lone 8 at col1, row6 has 1/4/1, but no replication there—suggests seed found around row6-7 but matching failed for some j, or levels miscomputed (n=27, L=4 [1,3,5,7], but placements go to row23 implying more levels needed); also, row9/14-17/19-22 empty where expected might fill based on higher "levels" (e.g., if levels every odd row, missing odds like 9,11,...21); overfilled row23 with non-bg 8's where space might not be empty or match wrong; core issue: doesn't fully replicate across all possible offsets, leaving gaps (e.g., no block around row 0-3 or 14-17), and block widths (4+4) match a possible seed but colors (1 in row8,4/2 in10-13,1 in18,8 in23) don't consistently derive from sequential upper levels—looks like partial matching but wrong level selection or interval.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:02:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where the background color dominates, and the task is to detect and complete incomplete "tier" structures—square blocks of uniform color bars arranged in a repeating pattern vertically and extrapolated horizontally/vertically based on "signal colors" sampled from the grid's odd-indexed positions. The program identifies existing partial tiers, matches them to signal patterns, and fills in missing background areas to form complete squares without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color (e.g., 3), and all fillings must only replace background cells, never overwriting existing non-background cells to preserve the puzzle's integrity.
 * Signal colors are extracted from the centers (odd rows and columns, like (1,1), (1,3), etc.) of potential block positions, but only if they are non-background and horizontally bounded by background on both sides (indicating isolated signals).
 * Tiers are square blocks of height/width equal to a uniform bar width (min 2), consisting of horizontal bars of the same width, aligned vertically without gaps, and separated by background; the program checks for exact structural matches (positions and colors) across rows to confirm a tier.
 * Detection allows for partially visible tiers at the top edge (by checking if the missing upper part could be all background), but does not handle bottom-edge incompleteness or rotated/misaligned tiers.
 * Extrapolation uses the step size between bar starts (assuming regular spacing) and matches signal sequences to the existing tier's colors to position new tiers at offset rows/columns; it skips out-of-bounds placements.
 * Subtlety: Signal levels are grouped by odd rows, and matching requires exact subsequence alignment (sliding window over signals to find the existing tier's color sequence), which assumes signals are in order and no duplicates/mismatches in length.
 * Edge cases: Grids with no signals or no detectable tiers return unchanged; assumes square grid (n x n); bar extraction skips single-cell or narrow bars (<2 width); step calculation assumes at least two bars for accurate spacing, defaults to bar_w + 2 otherwise.
 * Potential misses: Does not handle vertical bars or non-horizontal structures; assumes all tiers in a "family" share the same height/step; no rotation or diagonal patterns; signal extraction might miss if centers are background or not isolated.
 * Considerations from code: Flat counter for background is robust; bar extraction uses run-length encoding for efficiency; tier height must exactly match width for a valid square; completion check for upper extension verifies only the bar columns are background above.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Robust for identifying dominant background color via frequency count.)

```python
def get_signal_colors(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    signal_colors = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        level = []
        for c in range(1, n, 2):
            if 0 <= c < n and grid[r][c] != bg:
                left_bg = (c <= 0 or grid[r][c - 1] == bg)
                right_bg = (c >= n - 1 or grid[r][c + 1] == bg)
                if left_bg and right_bg:
                    level.append(grid[r][c])
        if level:
            signal_colors.append(level)
    return signal_colors
```
(Helpful for extracting isolated non-background colors at odd indices as "signals" for pattern matching; bounds checking prevents index errors.)

```python
def extract_bars(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, n: int, bg: int, min_w: int = 2) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    row = grid[r]
    bars = []
    c = 0
    while c < n:
        if row[c] == bg:
            c += 1
            continue
        colr = row[c]
        start = c
        while c < n and row[c] == colr:
            c += 1
        w = c - start
        if w >= min_w:
            bars.append((start, w, colr))
    return bars
```
(Essential for run-length extraction of horizontal bars in a row, filtering by min width; returns start, width, color for structural comparison.)

```python
def detect_existing_tier(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, List[int], List[int], int, int]]:
    # (Full function body as in the program; scans rows for uniform-width repeating bars forming a square tier, allows upper extension if background.)
    pass  # Placeholder; the full logic checks vertical repetition, uniform widths, and potential completion above.
```
(Core detection function; identifies partial or complete square tiers by bar structure matching across rows; computes step from bar positions.)

```python
def fill_if_background(grid: List[List[int]], r_start: int, c_start: int, h: int, w: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    for dr in range(h):
        r = r_start + dr
        if not (0 <= r < n):
            continue
        for dc in range(w):
            c = c_start + dc
            if 0 <= c < n and grid[r][c] == bg:
                grid[r][c] = color
```
(Useful for safe filling: only overwrites background in a rectangular area, with bounds checking; preserves existing content.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single (last) submission analyzed; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating strong handling of basic tier detection, signal matching, and filling for simpler cases (e.g., single partial tier with clear signals and regular spacing).
 * Worked: Background detection via counter is reliable; bar extraction correctly identifies horizontal runs; tier detection finds uniform square structures and partial upper completions; signal extraction isolates centers properly; extrapolation fills based on step and offsets without overwriting.
 * Did not work (inferred from code limitations): May fail on tiers with irregular spacing (step miscalculation if <2 bars); assumes all signals in a level are for one tier family, potentially mismatching if multiple tier types; no handling for bottom-incomplete tiers or non-square heights; signal levels might skip empty rows, leading to offset errors in vertical positioning.
 * The `program` main function integrates everything well but returns unchanged grid if no tier or match found, which is safe but conservative.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant and build toward the core logic (extraction -> detection -> matching -> filling).
 * Training examples all correct, suggesting the core principles (signal-guided tier completion) are understood for standard cases, but test may reveal edge cases like larger n=27, multiple tier families, or offset signals.

**Test output:**
 * The test output appears to be a 27x27 grid (27 rows, each with 27 integers) with background 3 mostly intact, and targeted fillings: e.g., rows 1-2 and 3-4 show scattered 1's and 4's/2's in early columns (likely completing small tiers); rows 5-8 have a large block of 1's from columns ~8-24 with internal 3's (separators?); rows 9-12 fill 4's and 2's in blocks ~8-12 and ~13-17, ~18-22; rows 15-18 fill 1's and 4's in similar block patterns; rows 20-23 fill 8's in a single block ~8-12; rows 24-27 all background.
 * It makes sense as an extension of the program's logic: detects existing partial tiers (e.g., the 1's in row 5-8 suggest a detected tier of height ~4, extrapolated left/right based on signals); fills create square-like blocks with colors matching signals (1,4,2,8 appearing in patterns); no overwrites evident since existing non-3's are preserved (e.g., row 6 has pre-existing 1's).
 * However, it may not be fully correct: The fillings in rows 5-8 create a wide horizontal structure with vertical consistency, but the code's horizontal extrapolation (via step) might overfill or misalign if signals have varying lengths (e.g., row 5 signals seem longer with multiple 1 groups separated by 3's, potentially indicating multiple tiers not fully merged); row 7 has an 8 in column 1, which looks like an isolated fill not tied to a clear tier (possible bug in base_start calculation or j_offset); bottom rows 20-23 fill only a small 8-block, skipping potential extensions to the right (code skips if c_start out of bounds, but signals might imply more); overall, it demonstrates partial completion but could miss subtle multi-tier overlaps or vertical offsets, leading to incomplete puzzles—e.g., the scattered early-column fills (rows 1-4) look like small 1/4/2 singles, but expected might be unified squares; unknown if all signals are consumed, as some positions (e.g., row 15-18) mix 1's and 4's in adjacent blocks without clear separation.
