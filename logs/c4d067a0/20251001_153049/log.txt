=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:30:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:48:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, so basic seq extraction, single-group slot detection, stage matching, and single placement worked for simple case (likely m=1, clear match, no overlaps).
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated placed 1,1 blocks in rows 8/9, 12/13, 16/17 (with no second group), but expected has 1,1 in rows 7/8/9 (overlapping?), and 1,1 + 3,3 in rows 11/12; also empty where expected has placements (e.g., row 10 empty in generated vs. 1,1+3,3 in expected); differences: wrong vertical positions (step=h+2 misaligned?), missed second group fills (used channel 1 only?), stage match wrong (placed too many/early); slot parsing likely failed on multi-row or gap.
 * Train3: Incorrect—generated placed 2,2+3,3 in rows 12/13 (shifted down), 3,3+3,3 in 16/17 (same channel? overlapping colors), 3,3+4,4 in 20/21; expected has 2,2+3,3 in 10/11, 3,3+3,3 in 15/16, 3,3+4,4 in 20/21, with empties in 12-14/17-19; differences: placements shifted down by ~2 rows (wrong start_s or step), extra/wrong colors in second groups (e.g., 3,3 twice instead of matching seq), missed empties between; unknown why first placement offset, but likely step=h+2 too large or start_s wrong; get_existing_slot only first row caused uniform assumption fail.
 * Overall: Worked for seq/instructions (common to all), slot span detection (found h correctly), but failed on group parsing (single-row only, wrong w/gap for multi-group), stage matching (didn't try all channels or handle m>2), placement positioning (wrong shifts, overwrote empties), and filling (used fixed channels, no per-group seq); unhelpful: the placement loop assumes all groups after first use same second_j, but may need per-group channel; no bounds/overlap checks; for m=0, defaults but doesn't place anything useful.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct— it replicates blocks like 1x4 (cols13-16/18-21) in rows 4-7 (but input already has them in 4-6?, added in 7?), 4x4 + 2x4? in rows 10-13 (colors 4 and 2), 1x4 in rows 16-19, 4x4? (8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

[2025-10-01 15:48:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

(8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:57:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) provide color sequences for multiple "channels" (up to 3), and the goal is to place vertical stacks of colored blocks (shapes) into predefined slots on the right side (starting from column 7) according to the sequence order, while using an existing partial slot to determine which "stage" (sequence index) to skip or modify placement for, ensuring the output grid reflects completed placements without overwriting existing content or the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells; only fill background cells (bg) with new colors.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered rows (starting from row 1) that have non-background colors in left columns [1,3,5]; these rows encode a sequence of k steps, where each step pulls colors from the three channels (col1 for primary, col3 for secondary, col5 for tertiary if present).
 * The right-side "slot" starts at column 7 and consists of vertical groups of colored blocks (e.g., runs of the same color horizontally); detect the existing partial slot by finding the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7, then parse horizontal groups within the first such row (color, start_col, width) to understand the shape template (e.g., multiple adjacent blocks with gaps).
 * The "stage" is determined by matching the first group's color in the existing slot to the earliest sequence position in channel 0 (col1), then checking if the second group matches channel 1 (col3) or channel 2 (col5) to decide the "second_channel" (2 or 3); this stage index indicates which sequence step to skip placing entirely.
 * Placements shift subsequent steps up or down by a fixed "step" distance (2*h - 1, where h is slot height) relative to the skipped stage's position, starting from the existing slot's row; each placement mirrors the existing slot's group structure (positions, widths, gaps) but uses sequence colors for that step, and only if the color != bg.
 * Subtlety: If m (number of groups) >=2, place second (and possibly third) groups using the appropriate channel's color for that step; third group only if second_channel is 3 (using channel 2) and its color != bg, positioned after a gap equal to s_gap (space between first and second group in existing slot).
 * Easy to miss: Placements must check bounds (r < n, c < n) and skip if start_row out of bounds or color == bg; existing slot parsing assumes groups are contiguous runs of non-bg starting from col 7, skipping bg gaps; sequences may have different lengths per channel, so use min(len) or check i < len(channel).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or shape transformation—shapes are axis-aligned vertical stacks mirroring the existing slot's horizontal group layout; no overwriting of instructions or left-side content; k can be variable based on instruction rows, and unused steps (after stage skip) may fall outside grid and be ignored.
 * Considerations: Grids are square (n x n), n=23 in examples; colors are small integers (1-8); existing slot may have 1-3 groups, with symmetric widths for second/third; step calculation ensures even spacing between placements (e.g., every other row block).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the bg color, used consistently.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(This accurately detects odd rows with instruction data in left columns, essential for extracting sequence.)

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            if c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] != bg:
                sequence[j].append(g[r][c])
    return sequence
```
(This extracts per-channel color lists from instruction rows, handling variable non-bg presence; core for sequence logic.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - w if m > 1 else 1
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 0
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(This parses the existing slot's bounding box, height, and group structure (color, start, width) from the first row; crucial for template matching and placement, though assumes single-row parsing—may need vertical consistency check.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core sequence extraction, slot detection, and basic placement/shifting logic works for simple cases (likely m=1 or straightforward stage match without third group).
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places extra 3,3 blocks in row 7 (positions ~16-17) where expected has bg (8,8), and mismatches in rows 10-11/13-14 by placing 1,1 blocks without the expected 3,3 in secondary slot position; also row 8 has 1,1,8,1,1,8,3,3 but expected lacks the 3,3—suggests over-placement of third group or wrong second_channel selection (chose 3 instead of 2?), and step shifting misaligns later steps (e.g., rows 10-11 should have 3,3 but generated has 8,8 there initially, then wrong in lower).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places shapes too early/low (e.g., rows 14-15 have 2,2 and 3,3 but expected has them in rows 10-11; rows 17-18 have 3,3 twice but expected has only one pair per block; rows 20-21 have 3,3,4,4 correctly positioned but generated misses vertical repetition or shifts wrong; also row 3 has extra 3,3,1,1 etc. in right side where expected is all bg—indicates faulty stage detection (find_stage returns wrong i+1,2 leading to skip=1 instead of later) and placement ignores h=2 for some blocks.
 * find_stage function is partially helpful but broken: it matches first_color to channel0 but assumes second_color match decides channel 2 vs 3; fails when m>=2 and sequences have varying lengths or no exact i match, defaulting to (1,2) which skips early step incorrectly; doesn't handle m=0 or no match (always falls back).
 * Placement loop in program() is helpful for shifting (start_row = start_s + (i - (stage-1)) * step) but buggy: skips i+1==stage correctly, but for m>=2 places second group always from channel1, overriding second_channel; third group only if second_channel_index==1 (wrong logic—should be if second_channel==3); also places over non-bg sometimes (if g_out[r][c] != bg check is there but may not prevent all overlaps); step=2*h-1 works for spacing but assumes even h and no bound clipping.
 * get_existing_slot is essential but assumes groups from first row only—may miss if existing slot has vertical variations; s_gap calculation is correct for positioning third but third_w assumes == second_w (subtlety: examples show symmetric, but confirm).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the third group placement condition (second_channel_index==1 and sequence[2][i] != bg) is inverted/wrong—leads to spurious placements in train2 (extra 3's) and misses in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places unexpected blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 in col1? No, cols 13-16:1,1,1,1 then 3,1,1,1,1,3—seems like early partial placements or misdetected slot start, but expected likely has no placements there as instructions are in rows1,3,5? Wait, test input not fully shown but generated has them where bg should be).
 * Rows 10-13: Places 4,4,4,4 in cols13-16 and 2,2,2,2 in 18-21 correctly positioned but repeated 4 times vertically (h=4?), matching a possible slot template, but if stage skip is wrong, this may overwrite or shift incorrectly—expected probably shifts to avoid overlap with input's existing in rows3-6 (input has 1's there).
 * Rows 17-20: Places another set of 1,1,1,1 /1,1,1,1 /3? but input already has similar in rows3-6, suggesting duplication without skip, or wrong step calculation leading to overlap; looks like it filled bg but ignored stage (possibly detected stage=1, skipping first but placing rest without proper shift, causing pile-up).
 * Overall, test output has too many placements (4 blocks instead of 3-4 sequence steps?) and ignores input's existing partial in rows3-6 (overwrites with more 1's), violating no-overwrite rule; does not match expected pattern of shifted completions around the existing slot—likely due to faulty find_stage (mismatch on second group color=1? to channel1 or2) and third group logic adding extras; makes no sense as it clutters the grid without clear sequence adherence.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) provide color sequences for multiple "channels" (up to 3), and the goal is to place vertical stacks of colored blocks (shapes) into predefined slots on the right side (starting from column 7) according to the sequence order, while using an existing partial slot to determine which "stage" (sequence index) to skip or modify placement for, ensuring the output grid reflects completed placements without overwriting existing content or the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells; only fill background cells (bg) with new colors.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered rows (starting from row 1) that have non-background colors in left columns [1,3,5]; these rows encode a sequence of k steps, where each step pulls colors from the three channels (col1 for primary, col3 for secondary, col5 for tertiary if present).
 * The right-side "slot" starts at column 7 and consists of vertical groups of colored blocks (e.g., runs of the same color horizontally); detect the existing partial slot by finding the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7, then parse horizontal groups within the first such row (color, start_col, width) to understand the shape template (e.g., multiple adjacent blocks with gaps).
 * The "stage" is determined by matching the first group's color in the existing slot to the earliest sequence position in channel 0 (col1), then checking if the second group matches channel 1 (col3) or channel 2 (col5) to decide the "second_channel" (2 or 3); this stage index indicates which sequence step to skip placing entirely.
 * Placements shift subsequent steps up or down by a fixed "step" distance (2*h - 1, where h is slot height) relative to the skipped stage's position, starting from the existing slot's row; each placement mirrors the existing slot's group structure (positions, widths, gaps) but uses sequence colors for that step, and only if the color != bg.
 * Subtlety: If m (number of groups) >=2, place second (and possibly third) groups using the appropriate channel's color for that step; third group only if second_channel is 3 (using channel 2) and its color != bg, positioned after a gap equal to s_gap (space between first and second group in existing slot).
 * Easy to miss: Placements must check bounds (r < n, c < n) and skip if start_row out of bounds or color == bg; existing slot parsing assumes groups are contiguous runs of non-bg starting from col 7, skipping bg gaps; sequences may have different lengths per channel, so use min(len) or check i < len(channel).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or shape transformation—shapes are axis-aligned vertical stacks mirroring the existing slot's horizontal group layout; no overwriting of instructions or left-side content; k can be variable based on instruction rows, and unused steps (after stage skip) may fall outside grid and be ignored.
 * Considerations: Grids are square (n x n), n=23 in examples; colors are small integers (1-8); existing slot may have 1-3 groups, with symmetric widths for second/third; step calculation ensures even spacing between placements (e.g., every other row block).

(This parses the existing slot's bounding box, height, and group structure (color, start, width) from the first row; crucial for template matching and placement, though assumes single-row parsing—may need vertical consistency check.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core sequence extraction, slot detection, and basic placement/shifting logic works for simple cases (likely m=1 or straightforward stage match without third group).
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places extra 3,3 blocks in row 7 (positions ~16-17) where expected has bg (8,8), and mismatches in rows 10-11/13-14 by placing 1,1 blocks without the expected 3,3 in secondary slot position; also row 8 has 1,1,8,1,1,8,3,3 but expected lacks the 3,3—suggests over-placement of third group or wrong second_channel selection (chose 3 instead of 2?), and step shifting misaligns later steps (e.g., rows 10-11 should have 3,3 but generated has 8,8 there initially, then wrong in lower).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places shapes too early/low (e.g., rows 14-15 have 2,2 and 3,3 but expected has them in rows 10-11; rows 17-18 have 3,3 twice but expected has only one pair per block; rows 20-21 have 3,3,4,4 correctly positioned but generated misses vertical repetition or shifts wrong; also row 3 has extra 3,3,1,1 etc. in right side where expected is all bg—indicates faulty stage detection (find_stage returns wrong i+1,2 leading to skip=1 instead of later) and placement ignores h=2 for some blocks.
 * find_stage function is partially helpful but broken: it matches first_color to channel0 but assumes second_color match decides channel 2 vs 3; fails when m>=2 and sequences have varying lengths or no exact i match, defaulting to (1,2) which skips early step incorrectly; doesn't handle m=0 or no match (always falls back).
 * Placement loop in program() is helpful for shifting (start_row = start_s + (i - (stage-1)) * step) but buggy: skips i+1==stage correctly, but for m>=2 places second group always from channel1, overriding second_channel; third group only if second_channel_index==1 (wrong logic—should be if second_channel==3); also places over non-bg sometimes (if g_out[r][c] != bg check is there but may not prevent all overlaps); step=2*h-1 works for spacing but assumes even h and no bound clipping.
 * get_existing_slot is essential but assumes groups from first row only—may miss if existing slot has vertical variations; s_gap calculation is correct for positioning third but third_w assumes == second_w (subtlety: examples show symmetric, but confirm).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the third group placement condition (second_channel_index==1 and sequence[2][i] != bg) is inverted/wrong—leads to spurious placements in train2 (extra 3's) and misses in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places unexpected blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 in col1? No, cols 13-16:1,1,1,1 then 3,1,1,1,1,3—seems like early partial placements or misdetected slot start, but expected likely has no placements there as instructions are in rows1,3,5? Wait, test input not fully shown but generated has them where bg should be).
 * Rows 10-13: Places 4,4,4,4 in cols13-16 and 2,2,2,2 in 18-21 correctly positioned but repeated 4 times vertically (h=4?), matching a possible slot template, but if stage skip is wrong, this may overwrite or shift incorrectly—expected probably shifts to avoid overlap with input's existing in rows3-6 (input has 1's there).
 * Rows 17-20: Places another set of 1,1,1,1 /1,1,1,1 /3? but input already has similar in rows3-6, suggesting duplication without skip, or wrong step calculation leading to overlap; looks like it filled bg but ignored stage (possibly detected stage=1, skipping first but placing rest without proper shift, causing pile-up).
 * Overall, test output has too many placements (4 blocks instead of 3-4 sequence steps?) and ignores input's existing partial in rows3-6 (overwrites with more 1's), violating no-overwrite rule; does not match expected pattern of shifted completions around the existing slot—likely due to faulty find_stage (mismatch on second group color=1? to channel1 or2) and third group logic adding extras; makes no sense as it clutters the grid without clear sequence adherence.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, so basic seq extraction, single-group slot detection, stage matching, and single placement worked for simple case (likely m=1, clear match, no overlaps).
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated placed 1,1 blocks in rows 8/9, 12/13, 16/17 (with no second group), but expected has 1,1 in rows 7/8/9 (overlapping?), and 1,1 + 3,3 in rows 11/12; also empty where expected has placements (e.g., row 10 empty in generated vs. 1,1+3,3 in expected); differences: wrong vertical positions (step=h+2 misaligned?), missed second group fills (used channel 1 only?), stage match wrong (placed too many/early); slot parsing likely failed on multi-row or gap.
 * Train3: Incorrect—generated placed 2,2+3,3 in rows 12/13 (shifted down), 3,3+3,3 in 16/17 (same channel? overlapping colors), 3,3+4,4 in 20/21; expected has 2,2+3,3 in 10/11, 3,3+3,3 in 15/16, 3,3+4,4 in 20/21, with empties in 12-14/17-19; differences: placements shifted down by ~2 rows (wrong start_s or step), extra/wrong colors in second groups (e.g., 3,3 twice instead of matching seq), missed empties between; unknown why first placement offset, but likely step=h+2 too large or start_s wrong; get_existing_slot only first row caused uniform assumption fail.
 * Overall: Worked for seq/instructions (common to all), slot span detection (found h correctly), but failed on group parsing (single-row only, wrong w/gap for multi-group), stage matching (didn't try all channels or handle m>2), placement positioning (wrong shifts, overwrote empties), and filling (used fixed channels, no per-group seq); unhelpful: the placement loop assumes all groups after first use same second_j, but may need per-group channel; no bounds/overlap checks; for m=0, defaults but doesn't place anything useful.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct— it replicates blocks like 1x4 (cols13-16/18-21) in rows 4-7 (but input already has them in 4-6?, added in 7?), 4x4 + 2x4? in rows 10-13 (colors 4 and 2), 1x4 in rows 16-19, 4x4? (8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: name 'g' is not defined
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 16:02:01] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows on the left side (with colored indicators in specific columns) dictate the placement of multi-group colored shapes (rectangles or blocks) into a vertical slot area on the right side of the grid, starting from an existing "seed" placement and stacking additional placements above or below it while skipping one instruction row (the "stage") and accounting for gaps between groups. The goal is to fill the slot with shapes matching the instructions, using the background color to identify empty space, and ensuring placements don't overlap or exceed grid bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the dominant color (e.g., 1) in the top-left, used to detect non-empty cells and avoid overwriting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-indexed) that contain non-background colors in left columns (specifically columns 1, 3, 5), indicating colors for shape groups; these rows guide what colors to use for placements but are not part of the slot.
 * The slot is a vertical area starting from column 7 (0-indexed) to the right edge, where existing non-background groups (consecutive same-color runs) define the initial "seed" placement: track its starting row (start_s), height (h, spanning multiple rows if vertical), first group's start column (first_start), width (w, assumed uniform), gap between groups (s_gap, including any empty columns), and list of groups (each as (color, start_col, width)).
 * Placements stack vertically relative to the seed: for each instruction row (except the skipped "stage" one), compute a starting row by accumulating distances of (h + varying empty gaps, where gaps increase by 1 per level, e.g., s_gap + t for level t); placements go above if before skipped, below if after, but clip if out of bounds (return -1).
 * Stage detection: Match the seed's first group color to an instruction row's column 1 color; if multiple groups in seed, check where the second group's color appears in the instruction row (column 3 for "channel 2", column 5 for "channel 3") to identify the skipped instruction index (stage = i+1, skipped_i = stage-1).
 * For each non-skipped instruction: Use color from column 1 for the first group placement (at seed's first_start and w); if seed has >=2 groups, use secondary color (from column 3 or 5 based on channel) for second group (at its seed position); for a potential third group, infer its position after second + s_gap with width w, using the remaining column's color (the one not used for secondary).
 * Subtleties: Gaps between groups increase progressively (s_gap + t, where t is the level index); placements only overwrite background cells; if no seed (h=0 or m=0 groups), or no instructions, return the input grid unchanged; ensure column indices don't exceed n; the seed height h spans the min/max rows with right-side content; uniform width assumption for groups may not always hold but seems key here.
 * Easy-to-miss: compute_start must handle directions (above/below skipped_i) correctly with accumulating steps; third group placement is conditional (only if space allows and color != bg); channel logic swaps secondary/tertiary colors based on detection; output is a copy of input with only new placements added (no removal).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to pass 'n' or 'g' correctly to all functions to avoid scope errors; positioning is sensitive to 0-indexing and gap calculations (off-by-one common); placements must match exact seed geometry (positions, widths); if m<2, no second/third groups; validate against bounds strictly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding: correctly identifies background (1), instruction rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5 with colors in cols 1,3), seed slot (e.g., at rows 9-10 with groups of 2's and 3's starting col 11 width 2, gap inferred), stage (likely skipped first instruction, channel 2), and attempts placements with correct colors/groups (first group color from col1, second from col3, third inferred).
 * What worked: For train 3, it successfully placed shapes in the right area (cols 11-12 for first, 16-17 for second/third) with correct colors (e.g., 2's and 3's for second instruction, 3's and 3's for third? but mismatched, 3's and 4's for fourth); detected multiple groups and handled third placement; no overwriting of non-bg.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors in train 1,2, and test due to 'g' not defined in compute_start (uses len(g) without parameter); for train 3, placements are INCORRECT due to off-by-one row positioning (e.g., second instruction's 2,2|3,3 placed at rows 9-10 instead of expected 10-11; third instruction's 3,3|3,3 at 14-15 instead of ? but expected at 15-16; fourth at 20-21 correct); possibly wrong skipping (placed something resembling first instruction's colors but skipped incorrectly?); third group for second instruction uses 3 but expected no third or different; uniform w assumption holds but gap calc may be off (s_gap + t increasing correctly? unknown if exact mismatch cause).
 * compute_start is helpful but broken (missing g parameter, and logic for above/below may have off-by-one in dist accumulation, e.g., starting from wrong t range or step calc); program function copies grid correctly and integrates pieces well.
 * No other attempts, but this demonstrates core puzzle grasp (stacking with skip/gaps) but fails on execution and precise positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output results in an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so it does not run at all and cannot produce a meaningful grid; this makes no sense for the puzzle, as it prevents any placement logic from executing.
 * Without a generated grid, it's impossible to verify correctness, but based on train 3 patterns, the test likely has a similar setup (instructions on left, seed on right) requiring the same stacking/skipping; the error indicates the code isn't robust (scope issue in compute_start), so it would fail to handle test-specific seed position, instruction count, or gap variations.
 * To handle test, must fix parameter passing (add g to compute_start) and debug positioning (e.g., verify t ranges in loops, ensure start_s aligns with seed min_r exactly, test gap progression like s_gap=2, then 3, etc.).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 16:02:11] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Colored square tiles**: Small squares in blue (🟦), yellow (🟨), red (🟥), and purple (🟪), arranged in irregular patterns within larger grids or sections, representing filled cells in a visual logic puzzle.
- **Background fields**: Expansive green (🟩) areas serving as empty space or canvas in the primary input grid; a contrasting purple/maroon (🟣) background in the secondary output-like section.
- **Grid structures**: Implied 3x3 or clustered arrangements of tiles (e.g., rows/columns of 2-3 tiles) in the input, transitioning to isolated pairs or singles in the output, suggesting a transformation or matching rule.
- **Empty spaces**: Blank or transparent gaps between tiles, emphasizing positioning and alignment across both input (scattered clusters) and output (central placements).

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are observations of consistent interactions or effects between elements across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). Only properties with clear, repeatable connections in every case are included. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are provided. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact color selection rules for new elements or precise y-position calculations) are noted as such. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small tile patterns that do not uniformly affect outputs, or one-off positions) are excluded.

#### 1. **Non-background tiles (small and large) ↔ Preservation in output**
   - **Interaction**: All input non-background tiles (1-pixel "small" tiles and >1-pixel "large" tiles) are directly copied to the output with no changes. This includes identical color, bounding box (bbox) coordinates, pixel count, and holes=0.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every train example. No tiles are removed, altered, or repositioned. Small tiles (pixels=1) maintain grid-like clustering at low y-values (e.g., y=1 to 7). Large tiles (pixels=4 or 9) retain their original positions.
   - **Affected properties**: Color, bbox (x and y), pixels, holes.

#### 2. **Input large tiles (pixels >1) ↔ New large tiles added in output (size inheritance)**
   - **Interaction**: Every output adds new large tiles (pixels >1, holes=0). The pixel count of each new tile exactly matches the pixel count of at least one existing large tile from the input (e.g., all new 9-pixel tiles match input 9-pixel tiles; all new 4-pixel tiles match input 4-pixel tiles).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every train example. Input 1 has 9-pixel larges → all 4 new tiles are 9 pixels. Input 2 has 4-pixel larges → all 8 new tiles are 4 pixels. Input 3 has 4-pixel larges → all 4 new tiles are 4 pixels.
   - **Affected properties**: Pixels (direct match). Bbox dimensions scale consistently with pixels (e.g., 9 pixels → width/height=3; 4 pixels → width/height=2), but exact x/y placement is unknown (y-positions increase relative to input larges, but delta varies: 3-5 units start-to-start, not uniform).
   - **Note**: Color of new tiles is always from colors present in input non-background tiles (e.g., Blue in input 1 → new Blues; Red/Green in input 3 → new Red/Green), but exact selection rule is unknown.

#### 3. **Input large tiles (x-bbox) ↔ New large tiles (partial position inheritance)**
   - **Interaction**: Many new large tiles in the output inherit the exact x-bbox range from input large tiles (e.g., input x=8-10 → new at x=8-10). This creates vertical alignment in x-direction. However, some outputs introduce new x-bbox ranges not present in input (e.g., input 2 adds x=16-17 column).
   - **Consistency**: Partial x-inheritance occurs in every train example (at least some new tiles match input x-ranges), but not all new tiles do so (e.g., extra columns in input 2). Y-bbox of new tiles is always higher than input large y-bbox (shifted "downward" in grid), with no overlap, but exact y-transformation is unknown.
   - **Affected properties**: Bbox x-range (inherited where applicable); bbox y (increased, unknown rule).

#### 4. **New large tiles added ↔ Background (holes and pixels adjustment)**
   - **Interaction**: The background (large bbox covering full grid, high pixels, holes >0) adjusts based on the new large tiles:
     - Holes increase exactly by the count of new large tiles added (e.g., +4 tiles → +4 holes; +8 tiles → +8 holes).
     - Pixels decrease exactly by the total pixel count of all new large tiles (e.g., 4×9=36 → -36 pixels; 8×4=32 → -32 pixels).
   - **Consistency**: Exact match in every train example. Input 1: +4 tiles, holes 8→12 (+4), pixels 505→469 (-36). Input 2: +8 tiles, holes 12→20 (+8), pixels 511→479 (-32). Input 3: +4 tiles, holes 8→12 (+4), pixels 515→499 (-16).
   - **Affected properties**: Background holes (additive count from new tiles), background pixels (subtractive sum from new tiles pixels). Background color and full bbox [0,0,N,N] remain unchanged.
   - **Note**: Background color varies by puzzle (Maroon in 1-2, Blue in 3) but is always preserved input-to-output. No other interactions (e.g., with small tiles) consistently affect it.

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No consistent interactions found**: Between small tiles and large tiles (e.g., no uniform effect of small tile colors/positions on new tile colors or counts). Between background and non-background tiles beyond the above (e.g., no position-based effects). Hole counts in non-background tiles (always 0, no change). Semantic shapes (e.g., silhouettes) cannot be assessed from data.
- **Unknowns explicitly called out**: Exact rules for new tile colors, y-bbox shifts, number of new tiles, or introduction of new x-ranges are not determinable from consistent patterns across all examples—variations exist (e.g., 4 vs. 8 new tiles; delta y=3 vs. 5).
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Isolated small tile arrangements (vary per input, no uniform output effect). Background in test input (Green) not analyzed, as focus is train consistency only.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:03:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) provide color sequences for multiple "channels" (up to 3), and the goal is to place vertical stacks of colored blocks (shapes) into predefined slots on the right side (starting from column 7) according to the sequence order, while using an existing partial slot to determine which "stage" (sequence index) to skip or modify placement for, ensuring the output grid reflects completed placements without overwriting existing content or the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells; only fill background cells (bg) with new colors.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered rows (starting from row 1) that have non-background colors in left columns [1,3,5]; these rows encode a sequence of k steps, where each step pulls colors from the three channels (col1 for primary, col3 for secondary, col5 for tertiary if present).
 * The right-side "slot" starts at column 7 and consists of vertical groups of colored blocks (e.g., runs of the same color horizontally); detect the existing partial slot by finding the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7, then parse horizontal groups within the first such row (color, start_col, width) to understand the shape template (e.g., multiple adjacent blocks with gaps).
 * The "stage" is determined by matching the first group's color in the existing slot to the earliest sequence position in channel 0 (col1), then checking if the second group matches channel 1 (col3) or channel 2 (col5) to decide the "second_channel" (2 or 3); this stage index indicates which sequence step to skip placing entirely.
 * Placements shift subsequent steps up or down by a fixed "step" distance (2*h - 1, where h is slot height) relative to the skipped stage's position, starting from the existing slot's row; each placement mirrors the existing slot's group structure (positions, widths, gaps) but uses sequence colors for that step, and only if the color != bg.
 * Subtlety: If m (number of groups) >=2, place second (and possibly third) groups using the appropriate channel's color for that step; third group only if second_channel is 3 (using channel 2) and its color != bg, positioned after a gap equal to s_gap (space between first and second group in existing slot).
 * Easy to miss: Placements must check bounds (r < n, c < n) and skip if start_row out of bounds or color == bg; existing slot parsing assumes groups are contiguous runs of non-bg starting from col 7, skipping bg gaps; sequences may have different lengths per channel, so use min(len) or check i < len(channel).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or shape transformation—shapes are axis-aligned vertical stacks mirroring the existing slot's horizontal group layout; no overwriting of instructions or left-side content; k can be variable based on instruction rows, and unused steps (after stage skip) may fall outside grid and be ignored.
 * Considerations: Grids are square (n x n), n=23 in examples; colors are small integers (1-8); existing slot may have 1-3 groups, with symmetric widths for second/third; step calculation ensures even spacing between placements (e.g., every other row block).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the bg color, used consistently.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(This accurately detects odd rows with instruction data in left columns, essential for extracting sequence.)

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            if c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] != bg:
                sequence[j].append(g[r][c])
    return sequence
```
(This extracts per-channel color lists from instruction rows, handling variable non-bg presence; core for sequence logic.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - w if m > 1 else 1
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 0
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(This parses the existing slot's bounding box, height, and group structure (color, start, width) from the first row; crucial for template matching and placement, though assumes single-row parsing—may need vertical consistency check.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core sequence extraction, slot detection, and basic placement/shifting logic works for simple cases (likely m=1 or straightforward stage match without third group).
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places extra 3,3 blocks in row 7 (positions ~16-17) where expected has bg (8,8), and mismatches in rows 10-11/13-14 by placing 1,1 blocks without the expected 3,3 in secondary slot position; also row 8 has 1,1,8,1,1,8,3,3 but expected lacks the 3,3—suggests over-placement of third group or wrong second_channel selection (chose 3 instead of 2?), and step shifting misaligns later steps (e.g., rows 10-11 should have 3,3 but generated has 8,8 there initially, then wrong in lower).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places shapes too early/low (e.g., rows 14-15 have 2,2 and 3,3 but expected has them in rows 10-11; rows 17-18 have 3,3 twice but expected has only one pair per block; rows 20-21 have 3,3,4,4 correctly positioned but generated misses vertical repetition or shifts wrong; also row 3 has extra 3,3,1,1 etc. in right side where expected is all bg—indicates faulty stage detection (find_stage returns wrong i+1,2 leading to skip=1 instead of later) and placement ignores h=2 for some blocks.
 * find_stage function is partially helpful but broken: it matches first_color to channel0 but assumes second_color match decides channel 2 vs 3; fails when m>=2 and sequences have varying lengths or no exact i match, defaulting to (1,2) which skips early step incorrectly; doesn't handle m=0 or no match (always falls back).
 * Placement loop in program() is helpful for shifting (start_row = start_s + (i - (stage-1)) * step) but buggy: skips i+1==stage correctly, but for m>=2 places second group always from channel1, overriding second_channel; third group only if second_channel_index==1 (wrong logic—should be if second_channel==3); also places over non-bg sometimes (if g_out[r][c] != bg check is there but may not prevent all overlaps); step=2*h-1 works for spacing but assumes even h and no bound clipping.
 * get_existing_slot is essential but assumes groups from first row only—may miss if existing slot has vertical variations; s_gap calculation is correct for positioning third but third_w assumes == second_w (subtlety: examples show symmetric, but confirm).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the third group placement condition (second_channel_index==1 and sequence[2][i] != bg) is inverted/wrong—leads to spurious placements in train2 (extra 3's) and misses in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places unexpected blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 in col1? No, cols 13-16:1,1,1,1 then 3,1,1,1,1,3—seems like early partial placements or misdetected slot start, but expected likely has no placements there as instructions are in rows1,3,5? Wait, test input not fully shown but generated has them where bg should be).
 * Rows 10-13: Places 4,4,4,4 in cols13-16 and 2,2,2,2 in 18-21 correctly positioned but repeated 4 times vertically (h=4?), matching a possible slot template, but if stage skip is wrong, this may overwrite or shift incorrectly—expected probably shifts to avoid overlap with input's existing in rows3-6 (input has 1's there).
 * Rows 17-20: Places another set of 1,1,1,1 /1,1,1,1 /3? but input already has similar in rows3-6, suggesting duplication without skip, or wrong step calculation leading to overlap; looks like it filled bg but ignored stage (possibly detected stage=1, skipping first but placing rest without proper shift, causing pile-up).
 * Overall, test output has too many placements (4 blocks instead of 3-4 sequence steps?) and ignores input's existing partial in rows3-6 (overwrites with more 1's), violating no-overwrite rule; does not match expected pattern of shifted completions around the existing slot—likely due to faulty find_stage (mismatch on second group color=1? to channel1 or2) and third group logic adding extras; makes no sense as it clutters the grid without clear sequence adherence.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, so basic seq extraction, single-group slot detection, stage matching, and single placement worked for simple case (likely m=1, clear match, no overlaps).
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated placed 1,1 blocks in rows 8/9, 12/13, 16/17 (with no second group), but expected has 1,1 in rows 7/8/9 (overlapping?), and 1,1 + 3,3 in rows 11/12; also empty where expected has placements (e.g., row 10 empty in generated vs. 1,1+3,3 in expected); differences: wrong vertical positions (step=h+2 misaligned?), missed second group fills (used channel 1 only?), stage match wrong (placed too many/early); slot parsing likely failed on multi-row or gap.
 * Train3: Incorrect—generated placed 2,2+3,3 in rows 12/13 (shifted down), 3,3+3,3 in 16/17 (same channel? overlapping colors), 3,3+4,4 in 20/21; expected has 2,2+3,3 in 10/11, 3,3+3,3 in 15/16, 3,3+4,4 in 20/21, with empties in 12-14/17-19; differences: placements shifted down by ~2 rows (wrong start_s or step), extra/wrong colors in second groups (e.g., 3,3 twice instead of matching seq), missed empties between; unknown why first placement offset, but likely step=h+2 too large or start_s wrong; get_existing_slot only first row caused uniform assumption fail.
 * Overall: Worked for seq/instructions (common to all), slot span detection (found h correctly), but failed on group parsing (single-row only, wrong w/gap for multi-group), stage matching (didn't try all channels or handle m>2), placement positioning (wrong shifts, overwrote empties), and filling (used fixed channels, no per-group seq); unhelpful: the placement loop assumes all groups after first use same second_j, but may need per-group channel; no bounds/overlap checks; for m=0, defaults but doesn't place anything useful.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct— it replicates blocks like 1x4 (cols13-16/18-21) in rows 4-7 (but input already has them in 4-6?, added in 7?), 4x4 + 2x4? in rows 10-13 (colors 4 and 2), 1x4 in rows 16-19, 4x4? (8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows on the left side (with colored indicators in specific columns) dictate the placement of multi-group colored shapes (rectangles or blocks) into a vertical slot area on the right side of the grid, starting from an existing "seed" placement and stacking additional placements above or below it while skipping one instruction row (the "stage") and accounting for gaps between groups. The goal is to fill the slot with shapes matching the instructions, using the background color to identify empty space, and ensuring placements don't overlap or exceed grid bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the dominant color (e.g., 1) in the top-left, used to detect non-empty cells and avoid overwriting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-indexed) that contain non-background colors in left columns (specifically columns 1, 3, 5), indicating colors for shape groups; these rows guide what colors to use for placements but are not part of the slot.
 * The slot is a vertical area starting from column 7 (0-indexed) to the right edge, where existing non-background groups (consecutive same-color runs) define the initial "seed" placement: track its starting row (start_s), height (h, spanning multiple rows if vertical), first group's start column (first_start), width (w, assumed uniform), gap between groups (s_gap, including any empty columns), and list of groups (each as (color, start_col, width)).
 * Placements stack vertically relative to the seed: for each instruction row (except the skipped "stage" one), compute a starting row by accumulating distances of (h + varying empty gaps, where gaps increase by 1 per level, e.g., s_gap + t for level t); placements go above if before skipped, below if after, but clip if out of bounds (return -1).
 * Stage detection: Match the seed's first group color to an instruction row's column 1 color; if multiple groups in seed, check where the second group's color appears in the instruction row (column 3 for "channel 2", column 5 for "channel 3") to identify the skipped instruction index (stage = i+1, skipped_i = stage-1).
 * For each non-skipped instruction: Use color from column 1 for the first group placement (at seed's first_start and w); if seed has >=2 groups, use secondary color (from column 3 or 5 based on channel) for second group (at its seed position); for a potential third group, infer its position after second + s_gap with width w, using the remaining column's color (the one not used for secondary).
 * Subtleties: Gaps between groups increase progressively (s_gap + t, where t is the level index); placements only overwrite background cells; if no seed (h=0 or m=0 groups), or no instructions, return the input grid unchanged; ensure column indices don't exceed n; the seed height h spans the min/max rows with right-side content; uniform width assumption for groups may not always hold but seems key here.
 * Easy-to-miss: compute_start must handle directions (above/below skipped_i) correctly with accumulating steps; third group placement is conditional (only if space allows and color != bg); channel logic swaps secondary/tertiary colors based on detection; output is a copy of input with only new placements added (no removal).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to pass 'n' or 'g' correctly to all functions to avoid scope errors; positioning is sensitive to 0-indexing and gap calculations (off-by-one common); placements must match exact seed geometry (positions, widths); if m<2, no second/third groups; validate against bounds strictly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding: correctly identifies background (1), instruction rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5 with colors in cols 1,3), seed slot (e.g., at rows 9-10 with groups of 2's and 3's starting col 11 width 2, gap inferred), stage (likely skipped first instruction, channel 2), and attempts placements with correct colors/groups (first group color from col1, second from col3, third inferred).
 * What worked: For train 3, it successfully placed shapes in the right area (cols 11-12 for first, 16-17 for second/third) with correct colors (e.g., 2's and 3's for second instruction, 3's and 3's for third? but mismatched, 3's and 4's for fourth); detected multiple groups and handled third placement; no overwriting of non-bg.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors in train 1,2, and test due to 'g' not defined in compute_start (uses len(g) without parameter); for train 3, placements are INCORRECT due to off-by-one row positioning (e.g., second instruction's 2,2|3,3 placed at rows 9-10 instead of expected 10-11; third instruction's 3,3|3,3 at 14-15 instead of ? but expected at 15-16; fourth at 20-21 correct); possibly wrong skipping (placed something resembling first instruction's colors but skipped incorrectly?); third group for second instruction uses 3 but expected no third or different; uniform w assumption holds but gap calc may be off (s_gap + t increasing correctly? unknown if exact mismatch cause).
 * compute_start is helpful but broken (missing g parameter, and logic for above/below may have off-by-one in dist accumulation, e.g., starting from wrong t range or step calc); program function copies grid correctly and integrates pieces well.
 * No other attempts, but this demonstrates core puzzle grasp (stacking with skip/gaps) but fails on execution and precise positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output results in an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so it does not run at all and cannot produce a meaningful grid; this makes no sense for the puzzle, as it prevents any placement logic from executing.
 * Without a generated grid, it's impossible to verify correctness, but based on train 3 patterns, the test likely has a similar setup (instructions on left, seed on right) requiring the same stacking/skipping; the error indicates the code isn't robust (scope issue in compute_start), so it would fail to handle test-specific seed position, instruction count, or gap variations.
 * To handle test, must fix parameter passing (add g to compute_start) and debug positioning (e.g., verify t ranges in loops, ensure start_s aligns with seed min_r exactly, test gap progression like s_gap=2, then 3, etc.).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are observations of consistent interactions or effects between elements across **all** train examples (inputs 1-3 and their outputs). Only properties with clear, repeatable connections in every case are included. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are provided. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact color selection rules for new elements or precise y-position calculations) are noted as such. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small tile patterns that do not uniformly affect outputs, or one-off positions) are excluded.

#### 1. **Non-background tiles (small and large) ↔ Preservation in output**
   - **Interaction**: All input non-background tiles (1-pixel "small" tiles and >1-pixel "large" tiles) are directly copied to the output with no changes. This includes identical color, bounding box (bbox) coordinates, pixel count, and holes=0.
   - **Consistency**: Occurs in every train example. No tiles are removed, altered, or repositioned. Small tiles (pixels=1) maintain grid-like clustering at low y-values (e.g., y=1 to 7). Large tiles (pixels=4 or 9) retain their original positions.
   - **Affected properties**: Color, bbox (x and y), pixels, holes.

#### 2. **Input large tiles (pixels >1) ↔ New large tiles added in output (size inheritance)**
   - **Interaction**: Every output adds new large tiles (pixels >1, holes=0). The pixel count of each new tile exactly matches the pixel count of at least one existing large tile from the input (e.g., all new 9-pixel tiles match input 9-pixel tiles; all new 4-pixel tiles match input 4-pixel tiles).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every train example. Input 1 has 9-pixel larges → all 4 new tiles are 9 pixels. Input 2 has 4-pixel larges → all 8 new tiles are 4 pixels. Input 3 has 4-pixel larges → all 4 new tiles are 4 pixels.
   - **Affected properties**: Pixels (direct match). Bbox dimensions scale consistently with pixels (e.g., 9 pixels → width/height=3; 4 pixels → width/height=2), but exact x/y placement is unknown (y-positions increase relative to input larges, but delta varies: 3-5 units start-to-start, not uniform).
   - **Note**: Color of new tiles is always from colors present in input non-background tiles (e.g., Blue in input 1 → new Blues; Red/Green in input 3 → new Red/Green), but exact selection rule is unknown.

#### 3. **Input large tiles (x-bbox) ↔ New large tiles (partial position inheritance)**
   - **Interaction**: Many new large tiles in the output inherit the exact x-bbox range from input large tiles (e.g., input x=8-10 → new at x=8-10). This creates vertical alignment in x-direction. However, some outputs introduce new x-bbox ranges not present in input (e.g., input 2 adds x=16-17 column).
   - **Consistency**: Partial x-inheritance occurs in every train example (at least some new tiles match input x-ranges), but not all new tiles do so (e.g., extra columns in input 2). Y-bbox of new tiles is always higher than input large y-bbox (shifted "downward" in grid), with no overlap, but exact y-transformation is unknown.
   - **Affected properties**: Bbox x-range (inherited where applicable); bbox y (increased, unknown rule).

#### 4. **New large tiles added ↔ Background (holes and pixels adjustment)**
   - **Interaction**: The background (large bbox covering full grid, high pixels, holes >0) adjusts based on the new large tiles:
     - Holes increase exactly by the count of new large tiles added (e.g., +4 tiles → +4 holes; +8 tiles → +8 holes).
     - Pixels decrease exactly by the total pixel count of all new large tiles (e.g., 4×9=36 → -36 pixels; 8×4=32 → -32 pixels).
   - **Consistency**: Exact match in every train example. Input 1: +4 tiles, holes 8→12 (+4), pixels 505→469 (-36). Input 2: +8 tiles, holes 12→20 (+8), pixels 511→479 (-32). Input 3: +4 tiles, holes 8→12 (+4), pixels 515→499 (-16).
   - **Affected properties**: Background holes (additive count from new tiles), background pixels (subtractive sum from new tiles pixels). Background color and full bbox [0,0,N,N] remain unchanged.
   - **Note**: Background color varies by puzzle (Maroon in 1-2, Blue in 3) but is always preserved input-to-output. No other interactions (e.g., with small tiles) consistently affect it.

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No consistent interactions found**: Between small tiles and large tiles (e.g., no uniform effect of small tile colors/positions on new tile colors or counts). Between background and non-background tiles beyond the above (e.g., no position-based effects). Hole counts in non-background tiles (always 0, no change). Semantic shapes (e.g., silhouettes) cannot be assessed from data.
- **Unknowns explicitly called out**: Exact rules for new tile colors, y-bbox shifts, number of new tiles, or introduction of new x-ranges are not determinable from consistent patterns across all examples—variations exist (e.g., 4 vs. 8 new tiles; delta y=3 vs. 5).
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Isolated small tile arrangements (vary per input, no uniform output effect). Background in test input (Green) not analyzed, as focus is train consistency only.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:13:06] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows (typically odd-numbered rows starting from row 1) provide color sequences in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) to guide the placement of colored block groups into an existing partial structure (slot) on the right side of the grid (starting from column 7). The goal is to extend or complete the structure by placing new groups according to the instructions, accounting for spacing, heights derived from existing widths, stages (which may skip instructions), and boundary conditions, while preserving the background and avoiding overwrites except in specific cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all placements must respect it by only overwriting background cells unless handling boundary sticking or clearing.
 * Instruction rows are identified as odd rows (1,3,5,...) with non-background colors in at least one of columns 1,3,5; each such row encodes a sequence of up to 3 colors for placement (first in col1, second/third in col3 or col5 based on stage/channel logic).
 * The right-side slot (columns 7+) may have an existing partial structure; detect its vertical extent (min_r to max_r), group consecutive same-color horizontal runs (color, start_col, width), and use the first group's width as the placement height (h_place = w), with step = w + gap between first and second group.
 * Stages determine which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1) and channel for second color (2 or 3, based on matching existing second group's color in instruction cols); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match.
 * Placement starts at an effective row (shifted up if partial and non-boundary, or handled specially if at bottom boundary); place full height h_place of blocks, but for boundary cases, place the skipped instruction at the top and clear sticking parts below to background.
 * Subtleties: If no existing groups (m=0), do nothing; placements skip out-of-bounds; third color placement assumes symmetric width w and position after second group + gap; partial structures shorter than h_place shift up by difference; bottom-boundary (max_r == n-1) requires special clearing of protruding parts after placing skipped instruction.
 * Handle cases with 0-3 groups in existing slot; for m=1, only place first color; for m>=2, place second/third based on channel; gaps (s_gap) are assumed constant or derived from first gap.
 * Grid size n x n, with n odd (e.g., 27); ensure placements don't exceed n; copy input grid to output and modify only as specified.
 * Easy to miss: Channel detection relies on matching existing colors exactly in instruction rows; if no match, defaults may lead to incorrect skipping; boundary clearing only for sticking parts in skipped placement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Background detection is reliable and essential.

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
Accurately identifies instruction rows based on non-bg in left columns; useful for extracting sequences.

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = any(g[r][c] != bg for c in range(7, n))
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h_existing = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    if h_existing == 0:
        return min_r, max_r, h_existing, 7, 0, 1, [], 0
    row = g[start_s]  # Assumes uniform across height; may need vertical aggregation if not
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 7
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - groups[0][2] if m > 1 else 1
    return min_r, max_r, h_existing, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
Extracts existing slot bounds, groups, widths, and gaps; core for determining placement params, but assumes horizontal uniformity from first row—may fail if structure varies vertically.

```python
def find_stage(g: List[List[int]], instr_rows: List[int], bg: int, n: int, groups: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], m: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if m == 0:
        return 1, 2
    first_color = groups[0][0]
    k = len(instr_rows)
    for i in range(k):
        r = instr_rows[i]
        col0 = g[r][1] if 1 < n else bg
        if col0 == bg or col0 != first_color:
            continue
        if m <= 1:
            return i + 1, 2
        second_color = groups[1][0]
        col1 = g[r][3] if 3 < n else bg
        if col1 != bg and col1 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 2
        col2 = g[r][5] if 5 < n else bg
        if col2 != bg and col2 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 3
    return 1, 2
```
Determines stage (instruction index+1 to skip) and channel (2 or 3 for second color) by matching existing colors to instruction row signals; key for sequencing, but defaults to 1,2 if no full match—may skip incorrectly if partial matches.

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
Basic placement utility; only overwrites bg, which is safe but may not handle merging with existing non-bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly placing groups according to instructions, respecting stages, shifts, and boundaries.
 * Worked well for cases with existing partial structures (m>=1), instruction matching, and skipping logic, as evidenced by training passes.
 * get_existing_slot assumes structure is horizontally uniform from the top row of the slot, which worked in training but could miss vertical variations.
 * find_stage correctly defaults and matches channels, enabling proper second/third color placements in training.
 * Boundary handling (partial_non_boundary shift, partial_boundary clearing) was effective for training cases where structures touched the bottom.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_background, get_instruction_rows, get_existing_slot, find_stage, place_group) are relevant and contributed to training success, though get_existing_slot's row sampling may need enhancement for non-uniform vertical structures.
 * Sequence extraction in main program (pulling colors from left_cols per instr_row) is solid and directly used for placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows placements in multiple blocks: rows 5-8 have scattered 1's and a 4 in left/mid, plus a right-side structure of 1's in cols 13-16 and 18-21,23-26 (but incomplete/partial); rows 10-13 have 4's in cols 13-16 and 2's in 18-21; rows 15-18 have 1's in cols 13-16,18-21,23-26 but 4's in 23-26; rows 20-23 have 8's in cols 13-16.
 * Additional left-side elements: row1 has 1's in cols1,3,5; row3 has 4's in1,3 and 2 in5; row7 has 8 in1; row15-18 have 1's in left but 4's in right-end.
 * The output makes partial sense as an extension of an existing slot (assuming input had some base in cols13+), with heights of 4 (matching possible w=4 from groups like 1's/4's/2's/8's), steps around 4+gap, and placements skipping based on stage/channel (e.g., 8's placed separately, possibly skipped instruction).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: scattered left-side placements (e.g., row5:1,4,1; row6-9:1's in right but not fully grouped; row7:8 in left) suggest possible overwrites or incorrect instruction parsing, as instructions should only affect right slot—left should remain as input signals. Right structures have inconsistent gaps (e.g., col17 and22 are 3/bg between groups, but third placements in rows15-18 shift to 4's in col23+ without clear second group match). Bottom placements (rows20-23:8's) may indicate boundary sticking without proper clearing, leaving partial overlaps. Overall, while structured, the output has anomalies in positioning and left-side artifacts, differing from expected clean right-only extensions with uniform group heights/gaps; unknown if due to input specifics or code assumptions (e.g., vertical non-uniformity in slot detection).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 16:13:14] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically across **all three train input-output pairs** (no forcing of unclear links, no high-level interpretations, no irrelevant or inconsistent elements like isolated positions or unique colors). Unknown or non-repeating transformations (e.g., exact rules for new shape placement, sizing, or color assignment) are noted as such rather than explained. Only components with mutual effects (e.g., one affecting another's properties) are included. Irrelevant elements (e.g., empty spaces, non-interacting single instances) are excluded.

1. **Upper-left small 1-pixel shapes ↔ Preservation across transformation**:
   - Small foreground shapes (1 pixel, holes=0, bbox span=1 unit) located at low y-coordinates (y=1 to 7) and low x-coordinates (x=1 to 5) in the input remain identical in position, color, size (pixels=1), and holes=0 in the output.
   - Interaction: These shapes do not change or interact with new elements; their static presence consistently defines a fixed "input pattern" that coexists with (but does not alter) added elements below.
   - Consistent in every example: No modifications to these specific shapes.

2. **Foreground components (all shapes) ↔ Background "holes" property**:
   - The background's "holes" value equals the total number of foreground components (counting each connected shape—small or large—as 1, regardless of size or color).
   - Interaction: Adding new foreground components directly increases the background's holes by exactly the number of new components added (e.g., +4 holes for 4 new shapes). Existing components contribute unchanged to the count.
   - Consistent in every example: Inputs have holes matching initial component count; outputs reflect exact increment from new additions. No exceptions.

3. **All foreground shapes (pixels) ↔ Background "pixels" property**:
   - The background's "pixels" value = fixed canvas area minus total pixels of all foreground shapes (canvas=23x23=529 pixels for all train examples).
   - Interaction: Adding new foreground shapes subtracts their total pixels from the background's pixels (e.g., adding shapes with 36 pixels reduces background by 36). Existing foreground pixels remain subtracted unchanged.
   - Consistent in every example: Exact arithmetic match in inputs and outputs; no overlaps or anomalies.

4. **Existing larger foreground shapes (lower-right) ↔ New larger foreground shapes (position and columns)**:
   - Larger foreground shapes (>1 pixel, holes=0) in the input, located at higher y-coordinates (y≥4) and mid-to-high x (x≥10), influence new shapes by sharing the same x-column ranges (bbox x-start and x-end).
   - Interaction: New shapes are placed at higher y-positions (below existing ones, no y-overlap) but reuse the exact x-bbox columns of input larger shapes (e.g., input x=8-10 leads to new x=8-10). This creates vertical alignment without horizontal shift.
   - Consistent in every example: All new shapes align in x with input largers; y increases consistently downward. (Exact y-spacing or row increments unknown/inconsistent, e.g., gaps vary.)

5. **Input foreground colors ↔ New foreground shape colors**:
   - Colors of all input foreground shapes (small and large) determine the color set for new shapes.
   - Interaction: New shapes are assigned colors exclusively from the input's existing foreground colors (no new colors introduced). Existing larger shapes retain their color.
   - Consistent in every example: New shapes use only input colors (e.g., input has Yellow/Blue → new are Blue; input has Red/Blue/Green → new are Blue/Green). Background color does not propagate to new shapes.

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent interaction found for: Shape sizes (pixels/bbox dimensions) between input and new shapes (e.g., 9px in example 1 vs. 4px in examples 2-3; unknown transformation). Hole counts in individual shapes (all=0, no effect). Exact y-position rules for new shapes (gaps vary, unknown). Semantic meanings (e.g., no forced "grid" or "sequence" links without consistent evidence). Background color changes (none occur; remains fixed).
- These connections are purely observational from component properties (position, color, pixels, holes) and their mutual effects; no puzzle-solving attempted. Test input not analyzed for connections, per instructions.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:14:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) provide color sequences for multiple "channels" (up to 3), and the goal is to place vertical stacks of colored blocks (shapes) into predefined slots on the right side (starting from column 7) according to the sequence order, while using an existing partial slot to determine which "stage" (sequence index) to skip or modify placement for, ensuring the output grid reflects completed placements without overwriting existing content or the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells; only fill background cells (bg) with new colors.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered rows (starting from row 1) that have non-background colors in left columns [1,3,5]; these rows encode a sequence of k steps, where each step pulls colors from the three channels (col1 for primary, col3 for secondary, col5 for tertiary if present).
 * The right-side "slot" starts at column 7 and consists of vertical groups of colored blocks (e.g., runs of the same color horizontally); detect the existing partial slot by finding the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7, then parse horizontal groups within the first such row (color, start_col, width) to understand the shape template (e.g., multiple adjacent blocks with gaps).
 * The "stage" is determined by matching the first group's color in the existing slot to the earliest sequence position in channel 0 (col1), then checking if the second group matches channel 1 (col3) or channel 2 (col5) to decide the "second_channel" (2 or 3); this stage index indicates which sequence step to skip placing entirely.
 * Placements shift subsequent steps up or down by a fixed "step" distance (2*h - 1, where h is slot height) relative to the skipped stage's position, starting from the existing slot's row; each placement mirrors the existing slot's group structure (positions, widths, gaps) but uses sequence colors for that step, and only if the color != bg.
 * Subtlety: If m (number of groups) >=2, place second (and possibly third) groups using the appropriate channel's color for that step; third group only if second_channel is 3 (using channel 2) and its color != bg, positioned after a gap equal to s_gap (space between first and second group in existing slot).
 * Easy to miss: Placements must check bounds (r < n, c < n) and skip if start_row out of bounds or color == bg; existing slot parsing assumes groups are contiguous runs of non-bg starting from col 7, skipping bg gaps; sequences may have different lengths per channel, so use min(len) or check i < len(channel).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or shape transformation—shapes are axis-aligned vertical stacks mirroring the existing slot's horizontal group layout; no overwriting of instructions or left-side content; k can be variable based on instruction rows, and unused steps (after stage skip) may fall outside grid and be ignored.
 * Considerations: Grids are square (n x n), n=23 in examples; colors are small integers (1-8); existing slot may have 1-3 groups, with symmetric widths for second/third; step calculation ensures even spacing between placements (e.g., every other row block).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the bg color, used consistently.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(This accurately detects odd rows with instruction data in left columns, essential for extracting sequence.)

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            if c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] != bg:
                sequence[j].append(g[r][c])
    return sequence
```
(This extracts per-channel color lists from instruction rows, handling variable non-bg presence; core for sequence logic.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - w if m > 1 else 1
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 0
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(This parses the existing slot's bounding box, height, and group structure (color, start, width) from the first row; crucial for template matching and placement, though assumes single-row parsing—may need vertical consistency check.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core sequence extraction, slot detection, and basic placement/shifting logic works for simple cases (likely m=1 or straightforward stage match without third group).
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places extra 3,3 blocks in row 7 (positions ~16-17) where expected has bg (8,8), and mismatches in rows 10-11/13-14 by placing 1,1 blocks without the expected 3,3 in secondary slot position; also row 8 has 1,1,8,1,1,8,3,3 but expected lacks the 3,3—suggests over-placement of third group or wrong second_channel selection (chose 3 instead of 2?), and step shifting misaligns later steps (e.g., rows 10-11 should have 3,3 but generated has 8,8 there initially, then wrong in lower).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places shapes too early/low (e.g., rows 14-15 have 2,2 and 3,3 but expected has them in rows 10-11; rows 17-18 have 3,3 twice but expected has only one pair per block; rows 20-21 have 3,3,4,4 correctly positioned but generated misses vertical repetition or shifts wrong; also row 3 has extra 3,3,1,1 etc. in right side where expected is all bg—indicates faulty stage detection (find_stage returns wrong i+1,2 leading to skip=1 instead of later) and placement ignores h=2 for some blocks.
 * find_stage function is partially helpful but broken: it matches first_color to channel0 but assumes second_color match decides channel 2 vs 3; fails when m>=2 and sequences have varying lengths or no exact i match, defaulting to (1,2) which skips early step incorrectly; doesn't handle m=0 or no match (always falls back).
 * Placement loop in program() is helpful for shifting (start_row = start_s + (i - (stage-1)) * step) but buggy: skips i+1==stage correctly, but for m>=2 places second group always from channel1, overriding second_channel; third group only if second_channel_index==1 (wrong logic—should be if second_channel==3); also places over non-bg sometimes (if g_out[r][c] != bg check is there but may not prevent all overlaps); step=2*h-1 works for spacing but assumes even h and no bound clipping.
 * get_existing_slot is essential but assumes groups from first row only—may miss if existing slot has vertical variations; s_gap calculation is correct for positioning third but third_w assumes == second_w (subtlety: examples show symmetric, but confirm).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the third group placement condition (second_channel_index==1 and sequence[2][i] != bg) is inverted/wrong—leads to spurious placements in train2 (extra 3's) and misses in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places unexpected blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 in col1? No, cols 13-16:1,1,1,1 then 3,1,1,1,1,3—seems like early partial placements or misdetected slot start, but expected likely has no placements there as instructions are in rows1,3,5? Wait, test input not fully shown but generated has them where bg should be).
 * Rows 10-13: Places 4,4,4,4 in cols13-16 and 2,2,2,2 in 18-21 correctly positioned but repeated 4 times vertically (h=4?), matching a possible slot template, but if stage skip is wrong, this may overwrite or shift incorrectly—expected probably shifts to avoid overlap with input's existing in rows3-6 (input has 1's there).
 * Rows 17-20: Places another set of 1,1,1,1 /1,1,1,1 /3? but input already has similar in rows3-6, suggesting duplication without skip, or wrong step calculation leading to overlap; looks like it filled bg but ignored stage (possibly detected stage=1, skipping first but placing rest without proper shift, causing pile-up).
 * Overall, test output has too many placements (4 blocks instead of 3-4 sequence steps?) and ignores input's existing partial in rows3-6 (overwrites with more 1's), violating no-overwrite rule; does not match expected pattern of shifted completions around the existing slot—likely due to faulty find_stage (mismatch on second group color=1? to channel1 or2) and third group logic adding extras; makes no sense as it clutters the grid without clear sequence adherence.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

    return 1, 2  # Helpful for matching stage via seq[0] first color, trying channel 2 then 3 for second; but brittle on repeats or short seq; defaults poorly; essential but needs seq len checks.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, so basic seq extraction, single-group slot detection, stage matching, and single placement worked for simple case (likely m=1, clear match, no overlaps).
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated placed 1,1 blocks in rows 8/9, 12/13, 16/17 (with no second group), but expected has 1,1 in rows 7/8/9 (overlapping?), and 1,1 + 3,3 in rows 11/12; also empty where expected has placements (e.g., row 10 empty in generated vs. 1,1+3,3 in expected); differences: wrong vertical positions (step=h+2 misaligned?), missed second group fills (used channel 1 only?), stage match wrong (placed too many/early); slot parsing likely failed on multi-row or gap.
 * Train3: Incorrect—generated placed 2,2+3,3 in rows 12/13 (shifted down), 3,3+3,3 in 16/17 (same channel? overlapping colors), 3,3+4,4 in 20/21; expected has 2,2+3,3 in 10/11, 3,3+3,3 in 15/16, 3,3+4,4 in 20/21, with empties in 12-14/17-19; differences: placements shifted down by ~2 rows (wrong start_s or step), extra/wrong colors in second groups (e.g., 3,3 twice instead of matching seq), missed empties between; unknown why first placement offset, but likely step=h+2 too large or start_s wrong; get_existing_slot only first row caused uniform assumption fail.
 * Overall: Worked for seq/instructions (common to all), slot span detection (found h correctly), but failed on group parsing (single-row only, wrong w/gap for multi-group), stage matching (didn't try all channels or handle m>2), placement positioning (wrong shifts, overwrote empties), and filling (used fixed channels, no per-group seq); unhelpful: the placement loop assumes all groups after first use same second_j, but may need per-group channel; no bounds/overlap checks; for m=0, defaults but doesn't place anything useful.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct— it replicates blocks like 1x4 (cols13-16/18-21) in rows 4-7 (but input already has them in 4-6?, added in 7?), 4x4 + 2x4? in rows 10-13 (colors 4 and 2), 1x4 in rows 16-19, 4x4? (8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows on the left side (with colored indicators in specific columns) dictate the placement of multi-group colored shapes (rectangles or blocks) into a vertical slot area on the right side of the grid, starting from an existing "seed" placement and stacking additional placements above or below it while skipping one instruction row (the "stage") and accounting for gaps between groups. The goal is to fill the slot with shapes matching the instructions, using the background color to identify empty space, and ensuring placements don't overlap or exceed grid bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the dominant color (e.g., 1) in the top-left, used to detect non-empty cells and avoid overwriting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-indexed) that contain non-background colors in left columns (specifically columns 1, 3, 5), indicating colors for shape groups; these rows guide what colors to use for placements but are not part of the slot.
 * The slot is a vertical area starting from column 7 (0-indexed) to the right edge, where existing non-background groups (consecutive same-color runs) define the initial "seed" placement: track its starting row (start_s), height (h, spanning multiple rows if vertical), first group's start column (first_start), width (w, assumed uniform), gap between groups (s_gap, including any empty columns), and list of groups (each as (color, start_col, width)).
 * Placements stack vertically relative to the seed: for each instruction row (except the skipped "stage" one), compute a starting row by accumulating distances of (h + varying empty gaps, where gaps increase by 1 per level, e.g., s_gap + t for level t); placements go above if before skipped, below if after, but clip if out of bounds (return -1).
 * Stage detection: Match the seed's first group color to an instruction row's column 1 color; if multiple groups in seed, check where the second group's color appears in the instruction row (column 3 for "channel 2", column 5 for "channel 3") to identify the skipped instruction index (stage = i+1, skipped_i = stage-1).
 * For each non-skipped instruction: Use color from column 1 for the first group placement (at seed's first_start and w); if seed has >=2 groups, use secondary color (from column 3 or 5 based on channel) for second group (at its seed position); for a potential third group, infer its position after second + s_gap with width w, using the remaining column's color (the one not used for secondary).
 * Subtleties: Gaps between groups increase progressively (s_gap + t, where t is the level index); placements only overwrite background cells; if no seed (h=0 or m=0 groups), or no instructions, return the input grid unchanged; ensure column indices don't exceed n; the seed height h spans the min/max rows with right-side content; uniform width assumption for groups may not always hold but seems key here.
 * Easy-to-miss: compute_start must handle directions (above/below skipped_i) correctly with accumulating steps; third group placement is conditional (only if space allows and color != bg); channel logic swaps secondary/tertiary colors based on detection; output is a copy of input with only new placements added (no removal).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to pass 'n' or 'g' correctly to all functions to avoid scope errors; positioning is sensitive to 0-indexing and gap calculations (off-by-one common); placements must match exact seed geometry (positions, widths); if m<2, no second/third groups; validate against bounds strictly.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding: correctly identifies background (1), instruction rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5 with colors in cols 1,3), seed slot (e.g., at rows 9-10 with groups of 2's and 3's starting col 11 width 2, gap inferred), stage (likely skipped first instruction, channel 2), and attempts placements with correct colors/groups (first group color from col1, second from col3, third inferred).
 * What worked: For train 3, it successfully placed shapes in the right area (cols 11-12 for first, 16-17 for second/third) with correct colors (e.g., 2's and 3's for second instruction, 3's and 3's for third? but mismatched, 3's and 4's for fourth); detected multiple groups and handled third placement; no overwriting of non-bg.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors in train 1,2, and test due to 'g' not defined in compute_start (uses len(g) without parameter); for train 3, placements are INCORRECT due to off-by-one row positioning (e.g., second instruction's 2,2|3,3 placed at rows 9-10 instead of expected 10-11; third instruction's 3,3|3,3 at 14-15 instead of ? but expected at 15-16; fourth at 20-21 correct); possibly wrong skipping (placed something resembling first instruction's colors but skipped incorrectly?); third group for second instruction uses 3 but expected no third or different; uniform w assumption holds but gap calc may be off (s_gap + t increasing correctly? unknown if exact mismatch cause).
 * compute_start is helpful but broken (missing g parameter, and logic for above/below may have off-by-one in dist accumulation, e.g., starting from wrong t range or step calc); program function copies grid correctly and integrates pieces well.
 * No other attempts, but this demonstrates core puzzle grasp (stacking with skip/gaps) but fails on execution and precise positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output results in an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so it does not run at all and cannot produce a meaningful grid; this makes no sense for the puzzle, as it prevents any placement logic from executing.
 * Without a generated grid, it's impossible to verify correctness, but based on train 3 patterns, the test likely has a similar setup (instructions on left, seed on right) requiring the same stacking/skipping; the error indicates the code isn't robust (scope issue in compute_start), so it would fail to handle test-specific seed position, instruction count, or gap variations.
 * To handle test, must fix parameter passing (add g to compute_start) and debug positioning (e.g., verify t ranges in loops, ensure start_s aligns with seed min_r exactly, test gap progression like s_gap=2, then 3, etc.).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows (typically odd-numbered rows starting from row 1) provide color sequences in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) to guide the placement of colored block groups into an existing partial structure (slot) on the right side of the grid (starting from column 7). The goal is to extend or complete the structure by placing new groups according to the instructions, accounting for spacing, heights derived from existing widths, stages (which may skip instructions), and boundary conditions, while preserving the background and avoiding overwrites except in specific cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all placements must respect it by only overwriting background cells unless handling boundary sticking or clearing.
 * Instruction rows are identified as odd rows (1,3,5,...) with non-background colors in at least one of columns 1,3,5; each such row encodes a sequence of up to 3 colors for placement (first in col1, second/third in col3 or col5 based on stage/channel logic).
 * The right-side slot (columns 7+) may have an existing partial structure; detect its vertical extent (min_r to max_r), group consecutive same-color horizontal runs (color, start_col, width), and use the first group's width as the placement height (h_place = w), with step = w + gap between first and second group.
 * Stages determine which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1) and channel for second color (2 or 3, based on matching existing second group's color in instruction cols); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match.
 * Placement starts at an effective row (shifted up if partial and non-boundary, or handled specially if at bottom boundary); place full height h_place of blocks, but for boundary cases, place the skipped instruction at the top and clear sticking parts below to background.
 * Subtleties: If no existing groups (m=0), do nothing; placements skip out-of-bounds; third color placement assumes symmetric width w and position after second group + gap; partial structures shorter than h_place shift up by difference; bottom-boundary (max_r == n-1) requires special clearing of protruding parts after placing skipped instruction.
 * Handle cases with 0-3 groups in existing slot; for m=1, only place first color; for m>=2, place second/third based on channel; gaps (s_gap) are assumed constant or derived from first gap.
 * Grid size n x n, with n odd (e.g., 27); ensure placements don't exceed n; copy input grid to output and modify only as specified.
 * Easy to miss: Channel detection relies on matching existing colors exactly in instruction rows; if no match, defaults may lead to incorrect skipping; boundary clearing only for sticking parts in skipped placement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Background detection is reliable and essential.

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
Accurately identifies instruction rows based on non-bg in left columns; useful for extracting sequences.

    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 7
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - groups[0][2] if m > 1 else 1
    return min_r, max_r, h_existing, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
Extracts existing slot bounds, groups, widths, and gaps; core for determining placement params, but assumes horizontal uniformity from first row—may fail if structure varies vertically.

    for i in range(k):
        r = instr_rows[i]
        col0 = g[r][1] if 1 < n else bg
        if col0 == bg or col0 != first_color:
            continue
        if m <= 1:
            return i + 1, 2
        second_color = groups[1][0]
        col1 = g[r][3] if 3 < n else bg
        if col1 != bg and col1 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 2
        col2 = g[r][5] if 5 < n else bg
        if col2 != bg and col2 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 3
    return 1, 2
```
Determines stage (instruction index+1 to skip) and channel (2 or 3 for second color) by matching existing colors to instruction row signals; key for sequencing, but defaults to 1,2 if no full match—may skip incorrectly if partial matches.

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
Basic placement utility; only overwrites bg, which is safe but may not handle merging with existing non-bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly placing groups according to instructions, respecting stages, shifts, and boundaries.
 * Worked well for cases with existing partial structures (m>=1), instruction matching, and skipping logic, as evidenced by training passes.
 * get_existing_slot assumes structure is horizontally uniform from the top row of the slot, which worked in training but could miss vertical variations.
 * find_stage correctly defaults and matches channels, enabling proper second/third color placements in training.
 * Boundary handling (partial_non_boundary shift, partial_boundary clearing) was effective for training cases where structures touched the bottom.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_background, get_instruction_rows, get_existing_slot, find_stage, place_group) are relevant and contributed to training success, though get_existing_slot's row sampling may need enhancement for non-uniform vertical structures.
 * Sequence extraction in main program (pulling colors from left_cols per instr_row) is solid and directly used for placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows placements in multiple blocks: rows 5-8 have scattered 1's and a 4 in left/mid, plus a right-side structure of 1's in cols 13-16 and 18-21,23-26 (but incomplete/partial); rows 10-13 have 4's in cols 13-16 and 2's in 18-21; rows 15-18 have 1's in cols 13-16,18-21,23-26 but 4's in 23-26; rows 20-23 have 8's in cols 13-16.
 * Additional left-side elements: row1 has 1's in cols1,3,5; row3 has 4's in1,3 and 2 in5; row7 has 8 in1; row15-18 have 1's in left but 4's in right-end.
 * The output makes partial sense as an extension of an existing slot (assuming input had some base in cols13+), with heights of 4 (matching possible w=4 from groups like 1's/4's/2's/8's), steps around 4+gap, and placements skipping based on stage/channel (e.g., 8's placed separately, possibly skipped instruction).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: scattered left-side placements (e.g., row5:1,4,1; row6-9:1's in right but not fully grouped; row7:8 in left) suggest possible overwrites or incorrect instruction parsing, as instructions should only affect right slot—left should remain as input signals. Right structures have inconsistent gaps (e.g., col17 and22 are 3/bg between groups, but third placements in rows15-18 shift to 4's in col23+ without clear second group match). Bottom placements (rows20-23:8's) may indicate boundary sticking without proper clearing, leaving partial overlaps. Overall, while structured, the output has anomalies in positioning and left-side artifacts, differing from expected clean right-only extensions with uniform group heights/gaps; unknown if due to input specifics or code assumptions (e.g., vertical non-uniformity in slot detection).

### Identified Consistent Interconnections and Interactions

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear identically across **all three train input-output pairs** (no forcing of unclear links, no high-level interpretations, no irrelevant or inconsistent elements like isolated positions or unique colors). Unknown or non-repeating transformations (e.g., exact rules for new shape placement, sizing, or color assignment) are noted as such rather than explained. Only components with mutual effects (e.g., one affecting another's properties) are included. Irrelevant elements (e.g., empty spaces, non-interacting single instances) are excluded.

1. **Upper-left small 1-pixel shapes ↔ Preservation across transformation**:
   - Small foreground shapes (1 pixel, holes=0, bbox span=1 unit) located at low y-coordinates (y=1 to 7) and low x-coordinates (x=1 to 5) in the input remain identical in position, color, size (pixels=1), and holes=0 in the output.
   - Interaction: These shapes do not change or interact with new elements; their static presence consistently defines a fixed "input pattern" that coexists with (but does not alter) added elements below.
   - Consistent in every example: No modifications to these specific shapes.

2. **Foreground components (all shapes) ↔ Background "holes" property**:
   - The background's "holes" value equals the total number of foreground components (counting each connected shape—small or large—as 1, regardless of size or color).
   - Interaction: Adding new foreground components directly increases the background's holes by exactly the number of new components added (e.g., +4 holes for 4 new shapes). Existing components contribute unchanged to the count.
   - Consistent in every example: Inputs have holes matching initial component count; outputs reflect exact increment from new additions. No exceptions.

3. **All foreground shapes (pixels) ↔ Background "pixels" property**:
   - The background's "pixels" value = fixed canvas area minus total pixels of all foreground shapes (canvas=23x23=529 pixels for all train examples).
   - Interaction: Adding new foreground shapes subtracts their total pixels from the background's pixels (e.g., adding shapes with 36 pixels reduces background by 36). Existing foreground pixels remain subtracted unchanged.
   - Consistent in every example: Exact arithmetic match in inputs and outputs; no overlaps or anomalies.

4. **Existing larger foreground shapes (lower-right) ↔ New larger foreground shapes (position and columns)**:
   - Larger foreground shapes (>1 pixel, holes=0) in the input, located at higher y-coordinates (y≥4) and mid-to-high x (x≥10), influence new shapes by sharing the same x-column ranges (bbox x-start and x-end).
   - Interaction: New shapes are placed at higher y-positions (below existing ones, no y-overlap) but reuse the exact x-bbox columns of input larger shapes (e.g., input x=8-10 leads to new x=8-10). This creates vertical alignment without horizontal shift.
   - Consistent in every example: All new shapes align in x with input largers; y increases consistently downward. (Exact y-spacing or row increments unknown/inconsistent, e.g., gaps vary.)

5. **Input foreground colors ↔ New foreground shape colors**:
   - Colors of all input foreground shapes (small and large) determine the color set for new shapes.
   - Interaction: New shapes are assigned colors exclusively from the input's existing foreground colors (no new colors introduced). Existing larger shapes retain their color.
   - Consistent in every example: New shapes use only input colors (e.g., input has Yellow/Blue → new are Blue; input has Red/Blue/Green → new are Blue/Green). Background color does not propagate to new shapes.

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent interaction found for: Shape sizes (pixels/bbox dimensions) between input and new shapes (e.g., 9px in example 1 vs. 4px in examples 2-3; unknown transformation). Hole counts in individual shapes (all=0, no effect). Exact y-position rules for new shapes (gaps vary, unknown). Semantic meanings (e.g., no forced "grid" or "sequence" links without consistent evidence). Background color changes (none occur; remains fixed).
- These connections are purely observational from component properties (position, color, pixels, holes) and their mutual effects; no puzzle-solving attempted. Test input not analyzed for connections, per instructions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:22:47] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (specific columns like 1,3,5 in odd rows) encodes multi-channel color sequences as instructions, which must be decoded and placed as stacked horizontal colored blocks (bars or groups) on the right side starting from column 7, matching and extending an existing partial structure while following spacing, skipping, and ordering rules to build a larger pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is determined from top-left cell; all placements only overwrite bg cells to avoid corrupting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1) that have non-bg cells in left columns [1,3,5]; sequences are extracted per channel (3 channels total) from these rows.
 * Existing slot on right (from col 7) defines initial structure: height h, first group start column first_start, width w, gap s_gap between groups, and list of groups (color, start_col, width); if no slot, do nothing.
 * "Stage" detection (skipped_i, second_channel) matches the first existing group's color to the first channel of some instruction i, then checks second group's color in channel 1 or 2 to decide ordering (second_channel=2 means place channel1 then channel2; =3 means place channel2 then channel1 if needed).
 * Placements stack vertically from start_s row, with base step = h + s_gap per instruction; skip one instruction (skipped_i) and don't shift its position; add +1 extra space (in vertical step) for the first instruction with 3 non-bg colors (first_three).
 * When placing for an instruction i: place channel0 always first at first_start with width w; for channels 1 and 2, use second_channel ordering, and if m>=2 (existing groups), use their positions/widths for the second placement, else use last_c + s_gap and width w; only place non-bg colors.
 * Vertical positions via compute_start_row must handle cases where i < skipped_i (negative shift) or i > skipped_i (positive cumulation), and incorporate the special +1 for first_three without double-counting or misaligning.
 * Edge cases: empty instructions (k=0), no slot (h=0 or m=0), out-of-bounds start_r + h > n (skip placement), instructions with 1-3 colors (m_list counts non-bg per i), gaps of 1 if no second group.
 * Subtle: compute_start_row's is_special lambda checks jj+1 == first_three (off-by-one?); cumulation must be precise to avoid row shifts; second_channel affects only the order of channels 1 and 2, not channel 0.
 * All placements are horizontal rectangles of uniform color, height h (copied from existing), but only up to n rows; no vertical stretching or rotation.
 * Puzzle goal: extend the right-side structure to match a "correct" stacked sequence without overlaps or misalignments, preserving left instructions and bg.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]  # Simple, reliable for bg detection; used correctly in all attempts.
```

        has_non_bg = any(g[r][c] != bg for c in left_cols if c < n)
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows  # Essential for extracting valid odd rows with instructions; works well.
```

```python

    # Finds min/max rows with non-bg in cols 7+, computes h, then parses first such row for groups (color, start_c, width)
    # Returns start_s (min_r), h, first_start (groups[0].start if exists), w (groups[0].width), s_gap (gap to next or 1), groups, m (len(groups))
    # Helpful for analyzing right-side structure, but assumes groups are in first row of slot and uniform height; works if slot is rectangular.
    # Note: i increments correctly for runs of same color, skips bg singles.
```

```python
def find_stage(sequence: List[List[int]], groups: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], m: int, k: int, bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if m == 0:
        return 0, 2
    first_color = groups[0][0]
    for i in range(k):
        if sequence[0][i] == first_color:
            if m <= 1:
                return i, 2
            second_color = groups[1][0]
            if sequence[1][i] == second_color:
                return i, 2  # Channel 1 matches second group -> standard order
            if sequence[2][i] == second_color:
                return i, 3  # Channel 2 matches -> swapped order
    return 0, 2  # Default if no match
    # Key for skipping/matching; subtle: only checks channels 1/2 for second_color, assumes channel0 always matches first.
```

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color  # Safe overwrite only on bg; essential to avoid corruption.
```

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- compute_start_row: Buggy in handling first_three special +1, leading to row shifts (e.g., cum not adjusting correctly for i around skipped_i or first_three); off-by-one in is_special (jj+1 == first_three?); doesn't handle negative shifts well if i < skipped_i.
- place_for_i: Logic for second_channel=3 swaps channels 1 and 2 but has redundant/conditional placement (placed_second flag), which may cause misordering if m<2; doesn't align widths/positions correctly when falling back to s_gap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 correct: Full sequence extraction, matching, and placement worked, including standard spacing and 2-channel ordering; no special 3-color case triggered.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places the final 1's+3's block starting at row 11 (with duplicates at 11-12, then 14-15), but expected starts it at row 10 (10-11, then 13-14); this is a vertical shift down by 1 row, likely due to compute_start_row misapplying the +1 special space for first_three (possibly not adding it or adding extra, causing cumulation error around skipped_i).
 * Training 2 also shows duplicate rows (e.g., generated rows 11=12, 14=15), suggesting place_for_i overwrites the same rows multiple times without vertical progression; expected has clean pairs without overlap.
 * Training 3 correct: Handled a case with swapped ordering (second_channel=3?) and possibly 3-color instruction, but without shift issues; indicates core matching and placement logic is solid except for spacing subtleties.
 * Missed precise cumulation in compute_start_row for cases where first_three is after skipped_i, leading to all subsequent positions offset.
 * find_stage works but defaults to (0,2) if no match, which may not skip correctly in edge cases.
 * get_existing_slot assumes uniform h across groups and parses only start_s row, which is fine if slot is solid but misses if groups have varying heights.
 * place_for_i's handling of m>=2 reuses exact group positions for second color, but for third always uses s_gap fallback; this worked in train1/3 but may not in cases with m=1.
 * Overall, sequence extraction and bg/slot detection are reliable; problem is in vertical positioning and channel ordering for multi-group placements.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this iteration shows partial understanding: passes simple cases but fails on special spacing/skipping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks at: rows 5-8 (mixed 1's and 4's/1's, irregular widths like four 1's with gaps); rows 10-13 (4's then 2's, four-wide each with gap); rows 15-18 (1's then 4's, similar); rows 20-23 (8's, four-wide, no second group); this follows the code's logic but looks over-dense/irregular compared to expected stacked uniform bars.
 * It does not look correct: Existing slot seems to be in rows 5-8 with 1's (possibly groups of color1 width4? but code placed extras); placements reuse h=4 but start_r computations likely misalign (e.g., rows 6-9 would be expected for second stack, but code puts at 10-13, suggesting same shift bug as train2); 8's at bottom have no gap/ordering, and row7 has stray 8 in col1? (may be input preservation).
 * Missing uniform widths/gaps (e.g., test input has potential w=4, s_gap=1, but placements have 1's in cols13-16,19-22,25-28? overlapping n=27); extra 1's in row5/6 suggest place_for_i placed channel1/2 without checking existing.
 * Does not account for test's larger n=27 and potential first_three (e.g., row5 has 3 colors? 1,4,1 but irregular); output has duplicates (rows6=7,10=11=12=13?,15=16=17=18?,20=21=22=23), indicating vertical cumulation failed entirely, stacking everything at wrong starts.
 * To fix for test: Debug compute_start_row to correctly add +1 only once for first_three in the cum loop, handle i < skipped_i without inverting steps, and ensure place_for_i skips if colr == bg or start_r out-of-bounds; verify slot parsing for test's potential multi-group in rows5-8 (1's at col13-16?).

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 16:24:18] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of **only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **every** train input/output pair (train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in the same way in **all** examples. I have excluded anything irrelevant (e.g., isolated elements like empty space or backgrounds without changes), inconsistent (e.g., variable spacings in y-positions, variable block sizes, or non-universal column matches), or speculative (e.g., no forced explanations of color mappings, position transformations, or hole semantics beyond direct effects). If a potential interaction (e.g., exact color or position rules) cannot be tied to a consistent, observable effect across all examples without solving, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Background Component (Large Encompassing Element with holes > 0) ↔ New Multi-Pixel Components (Added Blocks with holes = 0, pixels > 1)**
   - **Description**: The background is the large component (bbox spanning the full canvas, e.g., [0,0,22,22]; high pixel count; holes > 0; color varies but consistent within each example, e.g., Maroon in trains 1/2, Blue in train 3). New multi-pixel components (rectangular solid blocks, e.g., 2x2 or 3x3; various colors; added only in outputs) are overlaid onto the background.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - Each new multi-pixel component reduces the background's pixel count by exactly the new component's pixel count (e.g., adding a 9-pixel block reduces background by 9; adding an 4-pixel block reduces by 4).
     - Each new multi-pixel component increases the background's hole count by exactly 1, regardless of the new component's size, color, or position.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every example. Total pixel reduction = sum of all new components' pixels. Total hole increase = number of new components added (train 1: 4 new → +4 holes; train 2: 8 new → +8 holes; train 3: 4 new → +4 holes). No exceptions or variations.
   - **Affected Properties**: Background pixels (decreases), background holes (increases); new component's pixels (used to compute decrease, but new component itself unchanged post-addition).
   - **Unknowns**: Why +1 hole per addition (no consistent tie to shape properties like edges or silhouettes); no effect on new components' own properties.

#### 2. **Small 1-Pixel Components (Colored Dots at Low Coordinates) → No Observed Change or Interaction**
   - **Description**: These are isolated 1x1 components (pixels = 1; holes = 0; colors: Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, or Maroon; positioned at low x/y like [1,1], [3,3], [5,5], etc., forming grid-like patterns in the top-left area).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: None observed. These components remain identical in position, color, size, and pixels from input to output—no movement, transformation, or deletion.
   - **Consistency**: Present and unchanged in every example. They do not affect or get affected by other elements (e.g., no pixel/hole changes, no position shifts tied to backgrounds or blocks).
   - **Affected Properties**: None.
   - **Unknowns**: Potential indirect influence on new multi-pixel components' colors or positions (e.g., colors match small components' palette in all examples, but exact mapping unknown and not observably causal).

#### 3. **Input Multi-Pixel Components (Existing Larger Blocks with holes = 0, pixels > 1) → No Observed Change or Interaction**
   - **Description**: These are the pre-existing rectangular solid blocks in inputs (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3; colors: Yellow, Red, Green; positioned at mid-to-high x, variable y).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: None observed. These remain identical in position, color, size, pixels, and bbox from input to output—no movement, transformation, scaling, or deletion. They do not interact with new additions (e.g., no merging, color changes, or position effects).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input and unchanged in every output.
   - **Affected Properties**: None.
   - **Unknowns**: Potential role in determining x-positions of some new blocks (x-bbox overlap in all examples, but not universal—new columns appear in train 2 without matching inputs, so inconsistent).

No other interactions or connections are consistently observable across all examples (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects, no position-to-size transformations, no hole-to-shape effects beyond the background rule above). Elements like empty space or canvas edges show no interactions. The overall component list in outputs = (all input non-background components unchanged) + (new multi-pixel components) + (modified background).

[2025-10-01 16:24:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) provide color sequences for multiple "channels" (up to 3), and the goal is to place vertical stacks of colored blocks (shapes) into predefined slots on the right side (starting from column 7) according to the sequence order, while using an existing partial slot to determine which "stage" (sequence index) to skip or modify placement for, ensuring the output grid reflects completed placements without overwriting existing content or the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells; only fill background cells (bg) with new colors.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered rows (starting from row 1) that have non-background colors in left columns [1,3,5]; these rows encode a sequence of k steps, where each step pulls colors from the three channels (col1 for primary, col3 for secondary, col5 for tertiary if present).
 * The right-side "slot" starts at column 7 and consists of vertical groups of colored blocks (e.g., runs of the same color horizontally); detect the existing partial slot by finding the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7, then parse horizontal groups within the first such row (color, start_col, width) to understand the shape template (e.g., multiple adjacent blocks with gaps).
 * The "stage" is determined by matching the first group's color in the existing slot to the earliest sequence position in channel 0 (col1), then checking if the second group matches channel 1 (col3) or channel 2 (col5) to decide the "second_channel" (2 or 3); this stage index indicates which sequence step to skip placing entirely.
 * Placements shift subsequent steps up or down by a fixed "step" distance (2*h - 1, where h is slot height) relative to the skipped stage's position, starting from the existing slot's row; each placement mirrors the existing slot's group structure (positions, widths, gaps) but uses sequence colors for that step, and only if the color != bg.
 * Subtlety: If m (number of groups) >=2, place second (and possibly third) groups using the appropriate channel's color for that step; third group only if second_channel is 3 (using channel 2) and its color != bg, positioned after a gap equal to s_gap (space between first and second group in existing slot).
 * Easy to miss: Placements must check bounds (r < n, c < n) and skip if start_row out of bounds or color == bg; existing slot parsing assumes groups are contiguous runs of non-bg starting from col 7, skipping bg gaps; sequences may have different lengths per channel, so use min(len) or check i < len(channel).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or shape transformation—shapes are axis-aligned vertical stacks mirroring the existing slot's horizontal group layout; no overwriting of instructions or left-side content; k can be variable based on instruction rows, and unused steps (after stage skip) may fall outside grid and be ignored.
 * Considerations: Grids are square (n x n), n=23 in examples; colors are small integers (1-8); existing slot may have 1-3 groups, with symmetric widths for second/third; step calculation ensures even spacing between placements (e.g., every other row block).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the bg color, used consistently.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(This accurately detects odd rows with instruction data in left columns, essential for extracting sequence.)

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            if c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] != bg:
                sequence[j].append(g[r][c])
    return sequence
```
(This extracts per-channel color lists from instruction rows, handling variable non-bg presence; core for sequence logic.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - w if m > 1 else 1
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 0
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(This parses the existing slot's bounding box, height, and group structure (color, start, width) from the first row; crucial for template matching and placement, though assumes single-row parsing—may need vertical consistency check.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core sequence extraction, slot detection, and basic placement/shifting logic works for simple cases (likely m=1 or straightforward stage match without third group).
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places extra 3,3 blocks in row 7 (positions ~16-17) where expected has bg (8,8), and mismatches in rows 10-11/13-14 by placing 1,1 blocks without the expected 3,3 in secondary slot position; also row 8 has 1,1,8,1,1,8,3,3 but expected lacks the 3,3—suggests over-placement of third group or wrong second_channel selection (chose 3 instead of 2?), and step shifting misaligns later steps (e.g., rows 10-11 should have 3,3 but generated has 8,8 there initially, then wrong in lower).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places shapes too early/low (e.g., rows 14-15 have 2,2 and 3,3 but expected has them in rows 10-11; rows 17-18 have 3,3 twice but expected has only one pair per block; rows 20-21 have 3,3,4,4 correctly positioned but generated misses vertical repetition or shifts wrong; also row 3 has extra 3,3,1,1 etc. in right side where expected is all bg—indicates faulty stage detection (find_stage returns wrong i+1,2 leading to skip=1 instead of later) and placement ignores h=2 for some blocks.
 * find_stage function is partially helpful but broken: it matches first_color to channel0 but assumes second_color match decides channel 2 vs 3; fails when m>=2 and sequences have varying lengths or no exact i match, defaulting to (1,2) which skips early step incorrectly; doesn't handle m=0 or no match (always falls back).
 * Placement loop in program() is helpful for shifting (start_row = start_s + (i - (stage-1)) * step) but buggy: skips i+1==stage correctly, but for m>=2 places second group always from channel1, overriding second_channel; third group only if second_channel_index==1 (wrong logic—should be if second_channel==3); also places over non-bg sometimes (if g_out[r][c] != bg check is there but may not prevent all overlaps); step=2*h-1 works for spacing but assumes even h and no bound clipping.
 * get_existing_slot is essential but assumes groups from first row only—may miss if existing slot has vertical variations; s_gap calculation is correct for positioning third but third_w assumes == second_w (subtlety: examples show symmetric, but confirm).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the third group placement condition (second_channel_index==1 and sequence[2][i] != bg) is inverted/wrong—leads to spurious placements in train2 (extra 3's) and misses in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places unexpected blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 in col1? No, cols 13-16:1,1,1,1 then 3,1,1,1,1,3—seems like early partial placements or misdetected slot start, but expected likely has no placements there as instructions are in rows1,3,5? Wait, test input not fully shown but generated has them where bg should be).
 * Rows 10-13: Places 4,4,4,4 in cols13-16 and 2,2,2,2 in 18-21 correctly positioned but repeated 4 times vertically (h=4?), matching a possible slot template, but if stage skip is wrong, this may overwrite or shift incorrectly—expected probably shifts to avoid overlap with input's existing in rows3-6 (input has 1's there).
 * Rows 17-20: Places another set of 1,1,1,1 /1,1,1,1 /3? but input already has similar in rows3-6, suggesting duplication without skip, or wrong step calculation leading to overlap; looks like it filled bg but ignored stage (possibly detected stage=1, skipping first but placing rest without proper shift, causing pile-up).
 * Overall, test output has too many placements (4 blocks instead of 3-4 sequence steps?) and ignores input's existing partial in rows3-6 (overwrites with more 1's), violating no-overwrite rule; does not match expected pattern of shifted completions around the existing slot—likely due to faulty find_stage (mismatch on second group color=1? to channel1 or2) and third group logic adding extras; makes no sense as it clutters the grid without clear sequence adherence.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, so basic seq extraction, single-group slot detection, stage matching, and single placement worked for simple case (likely m=1, clear match, no overlaps).
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated placed 1,1 blocks in rows 8/9, 12/13, 16/17 (with no second group), but expected has 1,1 in rows 7/8/9 (overlapping?), and 1,1 + 3,3 in rows 11/12; also empty where expected has placements (e.g., row 10 empty in generated vs. 1,1+3,3 in expected); differences: wrong vertical positions (step=h+2 misaligned?), missed second group fills (used channel 1 only?), stage match wrong (placed too many/early); slot parsing likely failed on multi-row or gap.
 * Train3: Incorrect—generated placed 2,2+3,3 in rows 12/13 (shifted down), 3,3+3,3 in 16/17 (same channel? overlapping colors), 3,3+4,4 in 20/21; expected has 2,2+3,3 in 10/11, 3,3+3,3 in 15/16, 3,3+4,4 in 20/21, with empties in 12-14/17-19; differences: placements shifted down by ~2 rows (wrong start_s or step), extra/wrong colors in second groups (e.g., 3,3 twice instead of matching seq), missed empties between; unknown why first placement offset, but likely step=h+2 too large or start_s wrong; get_existing_slot only first row caused uniform assumption fail.
 * Overall: Worked for seq/instructions (common to all), slot span detection (found h correctly), but failed on group parsing (single-row only, wrong w/gap for multi-group), stage matching (didn't try all channels or handle m>2), placement positioning (wrong shifts, overwrote empties), and filling (used fixed channels, no per-group seq); unhelpful: the placement loop assumes all groups after first use same second_j, but may need per-group channel; no bounds/overlap checks; for m=0, defaults but doesn't place anything useful.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct— it replicates blocks like 1x4 (cols13-16/18-21) in rows 4-7 (but input already has them in 4-6?, added in 7?), 4x4 + 2x4? in rows 10-13 (colors 4 and 2), 1x4 in rows 16-19, 4x4? (8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows on the left side (with colored indicators in specific columns) dictate the placement of multi-group colored shapes (rectangles or blocks) into a vertical slot area on the right side of the grid, starting from an existing "seed" placement and stacking additional placements above or below it while skipping one instruction row (the "stage") and accounting for gaps between groups. The goal is to fill the slot with shapes matching the instructions, using the background color to identify empty space, and ensuring placements don't overlap or exceed grid bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the dominant color (e.g., 1) in the top-left, used to detect non-empty cells and avoid overwriting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-indexed) that contain non-background colors in left columns (specifically columns 1, 3, 5), indicating colors for shape groups; these rows guide what colors to use for placements but are not part of the slot.
 * The slot is a vertical area starting from column 7 (0-indexed) to the right edge, where existing non-background groups (consecutive same-color runs) define the initial "seed" placement: track its starting row (start_s), height (h, spanning multiple rows if vertical), first group's start column (first_start), width (w, assumed uniform), gap between groups (s_gap, including any empty columns), and list of groups (each as (color, start_col, width)).
 * Placements stack vertically relative to the seed: for each instruction row (except the skipped "stage" one), compute a starting row by accumulating distances of (h + varying empty gaps, where gaps increase by 1 per level, e.g., s_gap + t for level t); placements go above if before skipped, below if after, but clip if out of bounds (return -1).
 * Stage detection: Match the seed's first group color to an instruction row's column 1 color; if multiple groups in seed, check where the second group's color appears in the instruction row (column 3 for "channel 2", column 5 for "channel 3") to identify the skipped instruction index (stage = i+1, skipped_i = stage-1).
 * For each non-skipped instruction: Use color from column 1 for the first group placement (at seed's first_start and w); if seed has >=2 groups, use secondary color (from column 3 or 5 based on channel) for second group (at its seed position); for a potential third group, infer its position after second + s_gap with width w, using the remaining column's color (the one not used for secondary).
 * Subtleties: Gaps between groups increase progressively (s_gap + t, where t is the level index); placements only overwrite background cells; if no seed (h=0 or m=0 groups), or no instructions, return the input grid unchanged; ensure column indices don't exceed n; the seed height h spans the min/max rows with right-side content; uniform width assumption for groups may not always hold but seems key here.
 * Easy-to-miss: compute_start must handle directions (above/below skipped_i) correctly with accumulating steps; third group placement is conditional (only if space allows and color != bg); channel logic swaps secondary/tertiary colors based on detection; output is a copy of input with only new placements added (no removal).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to pass 'n' or 'g' correctly to all functions to avoid scope errors; positioning is sensitive to 0-indexing and gap calculations (off-by-one common); placements must match exact seed geometry (positions, widths); if m<2, no second/third groups; validate against bounds strictly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding: correctly identifies background (1), instruction rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5 with colors in cols 1,3), seed slot (e.g., at rows 9-10 with groups of 2's and 3's starting col 11 width 2, gap inferred), stage (likely skipped first instruction, channel 2), and attempts placements with correct colors/groups (first group color from col1, second from col3, third inferred).
 * What worked: For train 3, it successfully placed shapes in the right area (cols 11-12 for first, 16-17 for second/third) with correct colors (e.g., 2's and 3's for second instruction, 3's and 3's for third? but mismatched, 3's and 4's for fourth); detected multiple groups and handled third placement; no overwriting of non-bg.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors in train 1,2, and test due to 'g' not defined in compute_start (uses len(g) without parameter); for train 3, placements are INCORRECT due to off-by-one row positioning (e.g., second instruction's 2,2|3,3 placed at rows 9-10 instead of expected 10-11; third instruction's 3,3|3,3 at 14-15 instead of ? but expected at 15-16; fourth at 20-21 correct); possibly wrong skipping (placed something resembling first instruction's colors but skipped incorrectly?); third group for second instruction uses 3 but expected no third or different; uniform w assumption holds but gap calc may be off (s_gap + t increasing correctly? unknown if exact mismatch cause).
 * compute_start is helpful but broken (missing g parameter, and logic for above/below may have off-by-one in dist accumulation, e.g., starting from wrong t range or step calc); program function copies grid correctly and integrates pieces well.
 * No other attempts, but this demonstrates core puzzle grasp (stacking with skip/gaps) but fails on execution and precise positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output results in an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so it does not run at all and cannot produce a meaningful grid; this makes no sense for the puzzle, as it prevents any placement logic from executing.
 * Without a generated grid, it's impossible to verify correctness, but based on train 3 patterns, the test likely has a similar setup (instructions on left, seed on right) requiring the same stacking/skipping; the error indicates the code isn't robust (scope issue in compute_start), so it would fail to handle test-specific seed position, instruction count, or gap variations.
 * To handle test, must fix parameter passing (add g to compute_start) and debug positioning (e.g., verify t ranges in loops, ensure start_s aligns with seed min_r exactly, test gap progression like s_gap=2, then 3, etc.).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (specific columns like 1,3,5 in odd rows) encodes multi-channel color sequences as instructions, which must be decoded and placed as stacked horizontal colored blocks (bars or groups) on the right side starting from column 7, matching and extending an existing partial structure while following spacing, skipping, and ordering rules to build a larger pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is determined from top-left cell; all placements only overwrite bg cells to avoid corrupting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1) that have non-bg cells in left columns [1,3,5]; sequences are extracted per channel (3 channels total) from these rows.
 * Existing slot on right (from col 7) defines initial structure: height h, first group start column first_start, width w, gap s_gap between groups, and list of groups (color, start_col, width); if no slot, do nothing.
 * "Stage" detection (skipped_i, second_channel) matches the first existing group's color to the first channel of some instruction i, then checks second group's color in channel 1 or 2 to decide ordering (second_channel=2 means place channel1 then channel2; =3 means place channel2 then channel1 if needed).
 * Placements stack vertically from start_s row, with base step = h + s_gap per instruction; skip one instruction (skipped_i) and don't shift its position; add +1 extra space (in vertical step) for the first instruction with 3 non-bg colors (first_three).
 * When placing for an instruction i: place channel0 always first at first_start with width w; for channels 1 and 2, use second_channel ordering, and if m>=2 (existing groups), use their positions/widths for the second placement, else use last_c + s_gap and width w; only place non-bg colors.
 * Vertical positions via compute_start_row must handle cases where i < skipped_i (negative shift) or i > skipped_i (positive cumulation), and incorporate the special +1 for first_three without double-counting or misaligning.
 * Edge cases: empty instructions (k=0), no slot (h=0 or m=0), out-of-bounds start_r + h > n (skip placement), instructions with 1-3 colors (m_list counts non-bg per i), gaps of 1 if no second group.
 * Subtle: compute_start_row's is_special lambda checks jj+1 == first_three (off-by-one?); cumulation must be precise to avoid row shifts; second_channel affects only the order of channels 1 and 2, not channel 0.
 * All placements are horizontal rectangles of uniform color, height h (copied from existing), but only up to n rows; no vertical stretching or rotation.
 * Puzzle goal: extend the right-side structure to match a "correct" stacked sequence without overlaps or misalignments, preserving left instructions and bg.

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- compute_start_row: Buggy in handling first_three special +1, leading to row shifts (e.g., cum not adjusting correctly for i around skipped_i or first_three); off-by-one in is_special (jj+1 == first_three?); doesn't handle negative shifts well if i < skipped_i.
- place_for_i: Logic for second_channel=3 swaps channels 1 and 2 but has redundant/conditional placement (placed_second flag), which may cause misordering if m<2; doesn't align widths/positions correctly when falling back to s_gap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 correct: Full sequence extraction, matching, and placement worked, including standard spacing and 2-channel ordering; no special 3-color case triggered.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places the final 1's+3's block starting at row 11 (with duplicates at 11-12, then 14-15), but expected starts it at row 10 (10-11, then 13-14); this is a vertical shift down by 1 row, likely due to compute_start_row misapplying the +1 special space for first_three (possibly not adding it or adding extra, causing cumulation error around skipped_i).
 * Training 2 also shows duplicate rows (e.g., generated rows 11=12, 14=15), suggesting place_for_i overwrites the same rows multiple times without vertical progression; expected has clean pairs without overlap.
 * Training 3 correct: Handled a case with swapped ordering (second_channel=3?) and possibly 3-color instruction, but without shift issues; indicates core matching and placement logic is solid except for spacing subtleties.
 * Missed precise cumulation in compute_start_row for cases where first_three is after skipped_i, leading to all subsequent positions offset.
 * find_stage works but defaults to (0,2) if no match, which may not skip correctly in edge cases.
 * get_existing_slot assumes uniform h across groups and parses only start_s row, which is fine if slot is solid but misses if groups have varying heights.
 * place_for_i's handling of m>=2 reuses exact group positions for second color, but for third always uses s_gap fallback; this worked in train1/3 but may not in cases with m=1.
 * Overall, sequence extraction and bg/slot detection are reliable; problem is in vertical positioning and channel ordering for multi-group placements.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this iteration shows partial understanding: passes simple cases but fails on special spacing/skipping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks at: rows 5-8 (mixed 1's and 4's/1's, irregular widths like four 1's with gaps); rows 10-13 (4's then 2's, four-wide each with gap); rows 15-18 (1's then 4's, similar); rows 20-23 (8's, four-wide, no second group); this follows the code's logic but looks over-dense/irregular compared to expected stacked uniform bars.
 * It does not look correct: Existing slot seems to be in rows 5-8 with 1's (possibly groups of color1 width4? but code placed extras); placements reuse h=4 but start_r computations likely misalign (e.g., rows 6-9 would be expected for second stack, but code puts at 10-13, suggesting same shift bug as train2); 8's at bottom have no gap/ordering, and row7 has stray 8 in col1? (may be input preservation).
 * Missing uniform widths/gaps (e.g., test input has potential w=4, s_gap=1, but placements have 1's in cols13-16,19-22,25-28? overlapping n=27); extra 1's in row5/6 suggest place_for_i placed channel1/2 without checking existing.
 * Does not account for test's larger n=27 and potential first_three (e.g., row5 has 3 colors? 1,4,1 but irregular); output has duplicates (rows6=7,10=11=12=13?,15=16=17=18?,20=21=22=23), indicating vertical cumulation failed entirely, stacking everything at wrong starts.
 * To fix for test: Debug compute_start_row to correctly add +1 only once for first_three in the cum loop, handle i < skipped_i without inverting steps, and ensure place_for_i skips if colr == bg or start_r out-of-bounds; verify slot parsing for test's potential multi-group in rows5-8 (1's at col13-16?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows (typically odd-numbered rows starting from row 1) provide color sequences in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) to guide the placement of colored block groups into an existing partial structure (slot) on the right side of the grid (starting from column 7). The goal is to extend or complete the structure by placing new groups according to the instructions, accounting for spacing, heights derived from existing widths, stages (which may skip instructions), and boundary conditions, while preserving the background and avoiding overwrites except in specific cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all placements must respect it by only overwriting background cells unless handling boundary sticking or clearing.
 * Instruction rows are identified as odd rows (1,3,5,...) with non-background colors in at least one of columns 1,3,5; each such row encodes a sequence of up to 3 colors for placement (first in col1, second/third in col3 or col5 based on stage/channel logic).
 * The right-side slot (columns 7+) may have an existing partial structure; detect its vertical extent (min_r to max_r), group consecutive same-color horizontal runs (color, start_col, width), and use the first group's width as the placement height (h_place = w), with step = w + gap between first and second group.
 * Stages determine which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1) and channel for second color (2 or 3, based on matching existing second group's color in instruction cols); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match.
 * Placement starts at an effective row (shifted up if partial and non-boundary, or handled specially if at bottom boundary); place full height h_place of blocks, but for boundary cases, place the skipped instruction at the top and clear sticking parts below to background.
 * Subtleties: If no existing groups (m=0), do nothing; placements skip out-of-bounds; third color placement assumes symmetric width w and position after second group + gap; partial structures shorter than h_place shift up by difference; bottom-boundary (max_r == n-1) requires special clearing of protruding parts after placing skipped instruction.
 * Handle cases with 0-3 groups in existing slot; for m=1, only place first color; for m>=2, place second/third based on channel; gaps (s_gap) are assumed constant or derived from first gap.
 * Grid size n x n, with n odd (e.g., 27); ensure placements don't exceed n; copy input grid to output and modify only as specified.
 * Easy to miss: Channel detection relies on matching existing colors exactly in instruction rows; if no match, defaults may lead to incorrect skipping; boundary clearing only for sticking parts in skipped placement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:

Background detection is reliable and essential.

Accurately identifies instruction rows based on non-bg in left columns; useful for extracting sequences.

Extracts existing slot bounds, groups, widths, and gaps; core for determining placement params, but assumes horizontal uniformity from first row—may fail if structure varies vertically.

```
Determines stage (instruction index+1 to skip) and channel (2 or 3 for second color) by matching existing colors to instruction row signals; key for sequencing, but defaults to 1,2 if no full match—may skip incorrectly if partial matches.

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
Basic placement utility; only overwrites bg, which is safe but may not handle merging with existing non-bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly placing groups according to instructions, respecting stages, shifts, and boundaries.
 * Worked well for cases with existing partial structures (m>=1), instruction matching, and skipping logic, as evidenced by training passes.
 * get_existing_slot assumes structure is horizontally uniform from the top row of the slot, which worked in training but could miss vertical variations.
 * find_stage correctly defaults and matches channels, enabling proper second/third color placements in training.
 * Boundary handling (partial_non_boundary shift, partial_boundary clearing) was effective for training cases where structures touched the bottom.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_background, get_instruction_rows, get_existing_slot, find_stage, place_group) are relevant and contributed to training success, though get_existing_slot's row sampling may need enhancement for non-uniform vertical structures.
 * Sequence extraction in main program (pulling colors from left_cols per instr_row) is solid and directly used for placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows placements in multiple blocks: rows 5-8 have scattered 1's and a 4 in left/mid, plus a right-side structure of 1's in cols 13-16 and 18-21,23-26 (but incomplete/partial); rows 10-13 have 4's in cols 13-16 and 2's in 18-21; rows 15-18 have 1's in cols 13-16,18-21,23-26 but 4's in 23-26; rows 20-23 have 8's in cols 13-16.
 * Additional left-side elements: row1 has 1's in cols1,3,5; row3 has 4's in1,3 and 2 in5; row7 has 8 in1; row15-18 have 1's in left but 4's in right-end.
 * The output makes partial sense as an extension of an existing slot (assuming input had some base in cols13+), with heights of 4 (matching possible w=4 from groups like 1's/4's/2's/8's), steps around 4+gap, and placements skipping based on stage/channel (e.g., 8's placed separately, possibly skipped instruction).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: scattered left-side placements (e.g., row5:1,4,1; row6-9:1's in right but not fully grouped; row7:8 in left) suggest possible overwrites or incorrect instruction parsing, as instructions should only affect right slot—left should remain as input signals. Right structures have inconsistent gaps (e.g., col17 and22 are 3/bg between groups, but third placements in rows15-18 shift to 4's in col23+ without clear second group match). Bottom placements (rows20-23:8's) may indicate boundary sticking without proper clearing, leaving partial overlaps. Overall, while structured, the output has anomalies in positioning and left-side artifacts, differing from expected clean right-only extensions with uniform group heights/gaps; unknown if due to input specifics or code assumptions (e.g., vertical non-uniformity in slot detection).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, below is a list of **only the obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **every** train input/output pair (train 1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in the same way in **all** examples. I have excluded anything irrelevant (e.g., isolated elements like empty space or backgrounds without changes), inconsistent (e.g., variable spacings in y-positions, variable block sizes, or non-universal column matches), or speculative (e.g., no forced explanations of color mappings, position transformations, or hole semantics beyond direct effects). If a potential interaction (e.g., exact color or position rules) cannot be tied to a consistent, observable effect across all examples without solving, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Background Component (Large Encompassing Element with holes > 0) ↔ New Multi-Pixel Components (Added Blocks with holes = 0, pixels > 1)**
   - **Description**: The background is the large component (bbox spanning the full canvas, e.g., [0,0,22,22]; high pixel count; holes > 0; color varies but consistent within each example, e.g., Maroon in trains 1/2, Blue in train 3). New multi-pixel components (rectangular solid blocks, e.g., 2x2 or 3x3; various colors; added only in outputs) are overlaid onto the background.
   - **Interaction/Effect**:
     - Each new multi-pixel component reduces the background's pixel count by exactly the new component's pixel count (e.g., adding a 9-pixel block reduces background by 9; adding an 4-pixel block reduces by 4).
     - Each new multi-pixel component increases the background's hole count by exactly 1, regardless of the new component's size, color, or position.
   - **Consistency**: Observed in every example. Total pixel reduction = sum of all new components' pixels. Total hole increase = number of new components added (train 1: 4 new → +4 holes; train 2: 8 new → +8 holes; train 3: 4 new → +4 holes). No exceptions or variations.
   - **Affected Properties**: Background pixels (decreases), background holes (increases); new component's pixels (used to compute decrease, but new component itself unchanged post-addition).
   - **Unknowns**: Why +1 hole per addition (no consistent tie to shape properties like edges or silhouettes); no effect on new components' own properties.

#### 2. **Small 1-Pixel Components (Colored Dots at Low Coordinates) → No Observed Change or Interaction**
   - **Description**: These are isolated 1x1 components (pixels = 1; holes = 0; colors: Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, or Maroon; positioned at low x/y like [1,1], [3,3], [5,5], etc., forming grid-like patterns in the top-left area).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: None observed. These components remain identical in position, color, size, and pixels from input to output—no movement, transformation, or deletion.
   - **Consistency**: Present and unchanged in every example. They do not affect or get affected by other elements (e.g., no pixel/hole changes, no position shifts tied to backgrounds or blocks).
   - **Affected Properties**: None.
   - **Unknowns**: Potential indirect influence on new multi-pixel components' colors or positions (e.g., colors match small components' palette in all examples, but exact mapping unknown and not observably causal).

#### 3. **Input Multi-Pixel Components (Existing Larger Blocks with holes = 0, pixels > 1) → No Observed Change or Interaction**
   - **Description**: These are the pre-existing rectangular solid blocks in inputs (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3; colors: Yellow, Red, Green; positioned at mid-to-high x, variable y).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: None observed. These remain identical in position, color, size, pixels, and bbox from input to output—no movement, transformation, scaling, or deletion. They do not interact with new additions (e.g., no merging, color changes, or position effects).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input and unchanged in every output.
   - **Affected Properties**: None.
   - **Unknowns**: Potential role in determining x-positions of some new blocks (x-bbox overlap in all examples, but not universal—new columns appear in train 2 without matching inputs, so inconsistent).

No other interactions or connections are consistently observable across all examples (e.g., no reliable color-to-color effects, no position-to-size transformations, no hole-to-shape effects beyond the background rule above). Elements like empty space or canvas edges show no interactions. The overall component list in outputs = (all input non-background components unchanged) + (new multi-pixel components) + (modified background).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:27:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) in odd rows guide the placement of colored block groups into an "existing slot" area on the right side (starting from column 7). The goal is to copy and arrange sequences from the instructions into the output grid, skipping one "stage" (instruction row), adjusting channel orders based on matching existing groups, and respecting spacing, heights, and widths derived from the slot analysis, while preserving the background and non-overwriting existing content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always at g[0][0] and assumed uniform; any non-background in the slot area defines existing groups.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered starting from row 1, selected only if they have non-background cells in left columns 1,3,5; empty instructions (k=0) result in no changes.
 * Sequences are extracted per channel (col 1,3,5) across instruction rows, treating out-of-bounds as background.
 * Existing slot analysis: Find the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7 (start_s, h=height); if none, h=0 and no placement. Then parse horizontal groups in the first row of the slot (start_s) from col 7: consecutive same-color runs become groups (color, start_col, width); gaps between groups are s_gap (min 1 if no second group).
 * Stage detection: Match the first instruction row's channel 0 color to the first existing group's color; if there's a second group, check channel 1 or 2 for its color to decide second_channel (2 or 3, meaning swap channels 1 and 2 for placement). Default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match. This determines which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1).
 * Placement: For each non-skipped instruction i, compute start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i) * step (step = h + s_gap); place up to 3 blocks per row block: channel0 at first_start, then channel_sec at +w+s_gap, channel_ter at +another w+s_gap, only if non-bg, using place_group which fills h rows x w cols but skips existing non-bg cells (only overwrites bg). Skip if start_r out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Placement can overlap or extend beyond n but is clipped; assumes all groups have same width w (from first group); if m=0 or h=0, no placement. Channels may be bg (skipped). Existing groups are preserved (place_group doesn't overwrite non-bg). Gaps and steps ensure alignment with existing layout. Odd rows only for instructions avoids even rows which may be spacers. Left_cols fixed at [1,3,5], assuming 3-channel max. Colors are integers, bg=3 in test.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g):
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color reliably.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g, bg, n):
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(Accurately identifies active odd instruction rows based on non-bg in left channels.)

```python
def get_sequence(g, bg, instruction_rows, left_cols, k):
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            color = g[r][c] if c < len(g[0]) else bg
            sequence[j].append(color)
    return sequence
```
(Extracts per-channel color sequences from instruction rows, handling bounds.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g, bg, n):
    # (Full function as in program; parses bounding rows and horizontal groups in slot row)
    # Returns start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(Comprehensive for finding slot position, height, and parsing existing groups' colors/positions/widths/gaps; essential for alignment and matching.)

```python
def find_stage(sequence, groups, m):
    # (Full function as in program; matches first seq channel to groups to set stage and second_channel)
    # Returns stage (1-based index to skip), second_channel (2 or 3 for channel swap)
```
(Key for deciding skip and channel order based on existing groups.)

```python
def place_group(g_out, start_r, h, start_c, width, color, bg, n):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
(Safe placement: only overwrites bg, clips to grid; preserves existing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided; no prior attempts summarized, but it demonstrates core understanding of instruction extraction, slot parsing, stage skipping, and multi-channel placement with gaps.
 * Worked perfectly for all 3 training examples (all CORRECT), indicating solid grasp of rules for those cases: likely simple sequences, matching stages, and placements without edge cases like out-of-bounds or empty slots.
 * get_existing_slot correctly handles empty slots (h=0, m=0 -> no change) and parses groups accurately for matching.
 * find_stage defaults sensibly to stage 1/channel 2 if no match, and handles m<=1.
 * place_group's overwrite-only-bg prevents corruption of existing content.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: assumes all groups share the same w and s_gap from first/second; if varying widths/gaps in slot, this may misalign (but training passed, so likely uniform).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant and functional for this puzzle. get_background is simple but essential. No broken functions observed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: it places blocks on the right (cols 13+), e.g., rows 5-8 have 1's in 13-16/18-21/23-26 (matching a sequence of 1's), rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (18-21), rows 15-18 have 1's (13-16/18-21) and 4's (23-26, suggesting channel swap), rows 20-23 have 8's (13-16), which aligns with extracting sequences from left instructions (e.g., row3:4/4/2? row5:1/4/1, row7:8/bg/bg?, etc.) and placing with skip (possibly skipping row1 or another), step~5 (h=4? +gap1), w=4, s_gap=1, first_start=13.
 * However, differences from expected: Input has existing 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16/18-21/23-26 (already placed?), but output copies more 1's there without overwriting (correct), but row7 col1=8 is instruction, yet placement starts at row5? (maybe start_s=5, stage=1 skip i=0, so first placement at 5+(1-0)*step=5+step? Wait, code has start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i)*step, for i=1 (after skip0) =5+1*step, but output places at 5-8 which is before? Mismatch—expected placements should shift down by step after skip, but output seems to place starting too early or without proper skip offset, overlapping existing without shift. Also, row15-18 places 4's at end (23-26), suggesting second_channel=3 swap, but why not in earlier blocks? And rows20-23 only one block of 8's (ch0=8, others bg?), but if sequence has more, missing channels. Bottom rows 24-26 all bg, possibly out-of-bounds clip. Overall, placements follow pattern but offset/skip seems incorrect (e.g., no clear skip gap of h+s_gap~5 rows; placements at 5-8,10-13? Wait 9 empty, then15-18 gap,20-23), suggesting bug in start_r calculation when skipped_i early or step miscomputed from existing h/s_gap. Existing in input rows5-8/10-13/15-18/20-23? Wait input not fully shown, but output adds to right without full alignment—likely partial match but wrong positioning, so not correct. Unknown why gaps are irregular (e.g., row9/14/19/24 empty), possibly failed bounds check.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 16:27:48] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnections and Properties Across All Train Examples

The following are the only interactions, connections, or property relationships that are directly observable, obvious, and hold true in **every** train input/output pair (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to elements with clear, consistent effects or preservations. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Properties like color, position (bbox), size (pixels), and holes are considered where they demonstrably connect or affect other elements consistently. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific color transformations, variable shift distances, or semantic meanings) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact rules for generating new shapes) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Background Shape Interactions**
   - **Background color → No change**: The color of the background shape (Maroon in pairs 1 and 2; Blue in pair 3) remains identical from input to output. No interaction with other colors alters it.
   - **Background bbox → Preservation**: The bounding box ([0,0,22,22] in all train pairs) remains fixed from input to output, unaffected by added shapes.
   - **Added shapes (any) → Background holes**: The holes count in the background increases exactly by the number of new shapes (connected components) added in the output. 
     - Pair 1: +4 new shapes → holes 8 → 12.
     - Pair 2: +8 new shapes → holes 12 → 20.
     - Pair 3: +4 new shapes → holes 8 → 12.
   - **Added shapes pixels → Background pixels**: The pixels count in the background decreases exactly by the total pixels of all new shapes added in the output (no overlap or other effects).
     - Pair 1: +36 pixels added → 505 → 469.
     - Pair 2: +32 pixels added → 511 → 479.
     - Pair 3: +16 pixels added → 515 → 499.

#### 2. **Small Shapes (1-pixel) Interactions**
   - **Small shape position (bbox) → Preservation**: All 1-pixel shapes retain their exact bbox positions from input to output; no movement, addition, or removal of small shapes occurs.
     - Applies to all small Blues, Reds, Greens, and Yellows in top/mid rows (e.g., y=1,3,5,7 across pairs).
   - **Small shape color → Preservation**: The color of each 1-pixel shape remains unchanged from input to output.
   - **Small shape size (pixels=1, holes=0) → Preservation**: Size and holes for all 1-pixel shapes are fixed; no scaling or structural change.
   - **Small shapes → No interaction with other elements**: Small shapes do not affect, transform, or connect to background properties, large shapes, or new additions in any observable way (e.g., no consistent position/color influence on outputs).

#### 3. **Large Shapes (>1 pixel) Interactions**
   - **Large shape position (bbox) → Preservation for existing**: All input large shapes (>1 pixel, e.g., 4px or 9px) retain their exact bbox positions in the output; no movement or removal.
     - Pair 1: Yellow 9px shapes at [8,1,10,3] and [13,1,15,3] persist.
     - Pair 2: Red 4px shapes at [10,4,11,5] and [13,4,14,5] persist.
     - Pair 3: Green/Yellow 4px shapes at [11,20,12,21] and [16,20,17,21] persist.
   - **Large shape size (pixels, holes=0) → Preservation for existing**: Pixel count and holes=0 remain unchanged for input large shapes in output; no scaling.
   - **Large shape color → Preservation for existing**: Color of input large shapes remains the same in output.
   - **Input large shapes → Addition of new large shapes**: Existing large shapes consistently result in new large shapes being added in output (with matching size/pixels to input larges in that pair), but positions and colors of new shapes vary; transformation rule (e.g., how position/color of input large affects new ones) is unknown.
     - New shapes always have holes=0 and are "large" (pixels ≥4, consistent with input large sizes per pair).
     - No removal or alteration of existing larges.
   - **Large shapes → No direct interaction with small shapes**: No observable consistent effect between small and large shapes (e.g., no position/color propagation from small to large).

#### Notes on Scope
- **No other consistent interactions**: Elements like specific x/y shifts (e.g., +3 vs. +5), color mappings (e.g., Yellow/Red → Blue not universal), or hole counts in non-background shapes show no consistent connections across all pairs. New large shape generation is consistent in occurrence but unknown in mechanism.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Standalone properties (e.g., absolute positions without preservation/addition effects, variable grid spacings) or inconsistent ones (e.g., background color changes mentioned in high-level description but not in data) are not interactions.
- **Test input applicability**: These connections are derived solely from train pairs; no application or prediction for test input 1 is made.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:28:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) provide color sequences for multiple "channels" (up to 3), and the goal is to place vertical stacks of colored blocks (shapes) into predefined slots on the right side (starting from column 7) according to the sequence order, while using an existing partial slot to determine which "stage" (sequence index) to skip or modify placement for, ensuring the output grid reflects completed placements without overwriting existing content or the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells; only fill background cells (bg) with new colors.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered rows (starting from row 1) that have non-background colors in left columns [1,3,5]; these rows encode a sequence of k steps, where each step pulls colors from the three channels (col1 for primary, col3 for secondary, col5 for tertiary if present).
 * The right-side "slot" starts at column 7 and consists of vertical groups of colored blocks (e.g., runs of the same color horizontally); detect the existing partial slot by finding the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7, then parse horizontal groups within the first such row (color, start_col, width) to understand the shape template (e.g., multiple adjacent blocks with gaps).
 * The "stage" is determined by matching the first group's color in the existing slot to the earliest sequence position in channel 0 (col1), then checking if the second group matches channel 1 (col3) or channel 2 (col5) to decide the "second_channel" (2 or 3); this stage index indicates which sequence step to skip placing entirely.
 * Placements shift subsequent steps up or down by a fixed "step" distance (2*h - 1, where h is slot height) relative to the skipped stage's position, starting from the existing slot's row; each placement mirrors the existing slot's group structure (positions, widths, gaps) but uses sequence colors for that step, and only if the color != bg.
 * Subtlety: If m (number of groups) >=2, place second (and possibly third) groups using the appropriate channel's color for that step; third group only if second_channel is 3 (using channel 2) and its color != bg, positioned after a gap equal to s_gap (space between first and second group in existing slot).
 * Easy to miss: Placements must check bounds (r < n, c < n) and skip if start_row out of bounds or color == bg; existing slot parsing assumes groups are contiguous runs of non-bg starting from col 7, skipping bg gaps; sequences may have different lengths per channel, so use min(len) or check i < len(channel).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or shape transformation—shapes are axis-aligned vertical stacks mirroring the existing slot's horizontal group layout; no overwriting of instructions or left-side content; k can be variable based on instruction rows, and unused steps (after stage skip) may fall outside grid and be ignored.
 * Considerations: Grids are square (n x n), n=23 in examples; colors are small integers (1-8); existing slot may have 1-3 groups, with symmetric widths for second/third; step calculation ensures even spacing between placements (e.g., every other row block).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the bg color, used consistently.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(This accurately detects odd rows with instruction data in left columns, essential for extracting sequence.)

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            if c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] != bg:
                sequence[j].append(g[r][c])
    return sequence
```
(This extracts per-channel color lists from instruction rows, handling variable non-bg presence; core for sequence logic.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - w if m > 1 else 1
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 0
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(This parses the existing slot's bounding box, height, and group structure (color, start, width) from the first row; crucial for template matching and placement, though assumes single-row parsing—may need vertical consistency check.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core sequence extraction, slot detection, and basic placement/shifting logic works for simple cases (likely m=1 or straightforward stage match without third group).
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places extra 3,3 blocks in row 7 (positions ~16-17) where expected has bg (8,8), and mismatches in rows 10-11/13-14 by placing 1,1 blocks without the expected 3,3 in secondary slot position; also row 8 has 1,1,8,1,1,8,3,3 but expected lacks the 3,3—suggests over-placement of third group or wrong second_channel selection (chose 3 instead of 2?), and step shifting misaligns later steps (e.g., rows 10-11 should have 3,3 but generated has 8,8 there initially, then wrong in lower).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places shapes too early/low (e.g., rows 14-15 have 2,2 and 3,3 but expected has them in rows 10-11; rows 17-18 have 3,3 twice but expected has only one pair per block; rows 20-21 have 3,3,4,4 correctly positioned but generated misses vertical repetition or shifts wrong; also row 3 has extra 3,3,1,1 etc. in right side where expected is all bg—indicates faulty stage detection (find_stage returns wrong i+1,2 leading to skip=1 instead of later) and placement ignores h=2 for some blocks.
 * find_stage function is partially helpful but broken: it matches first_color to channel0 but assumes second_color match decides channel 2 vs 3; fails when m>=2 and sequences have varying lengths or no exact i match, defaulting to (1,2) which skips early step incorrectly; doesn't handle m=0 or no match (always falls back).
 * Placement loop in program() is helpful for shifting (start_row = start_s + (i - (stage-1)) * step) but buggy: skips i+1==stage correctly, but for m>=2 places second group always from channel1, overriding second_channel; third group only if second_channel_index==1 (wrong logic—should be if second_channel==3); also places over non-bg sometimes (if g_out[r][c] != bg check is there but may not prevent all overlaps); step=2*h-1 works for spacing but assumes even h and no bound clipping.
 * get_existing_slot is essential but assumes groups from first row only—may miss if existing slot has vertical variations; s_gap calculation is correct for positioning third but third_w assumes == second_w (subtlety: examples show symmetric, but confirm).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the third group placement condition (second_channel_index==1 and sequence[2][i] != bg) is inverted/wrong—leads to spurious placements in train2 (extra 3's) and misses in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places unexpected blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 in col1? No, cols 13-16:1,1,1,1 then 3,1,1,1,1,3—seems like early partial placements or misdetected slot start, but expected likely has no placements there as instructions are in rows1,3,5? Wait, test input not fully shown but generated has them where bg should be).
 * Rows 10-13: Places 4,4,4,4 in cols13-16 and 2,2,2,2 in 18-21 correctly positioned but repeated 4 times vertically (h=4?), matching a possible slot template, but if stage skip is wrong, this may overwrite or shift incorrectly—expected probably shifts to avoid overlap with input's existing in rows3-6 (input has 1's there).
 * Rows 17-20: Places another set of 1,1,1,1 /1,1,1,1 /3? but input already has similar in rows3-6, suggesting duplication without skip, or wrong step calculation leading to overlap; looks like it filled bg but ignored stage (possibly detected stage=1, skipping first but placing rest without proper shift, causing pile-up).
 * Overall, test output has too many placements (4 blocks instead of 3-4 sequence steps?) and ignores input's existing partial in rows3-6 (overwrites with more 1's), violating no-overwrite rule; does not match expected pattern of shifted completions around the existing slot—likely due to faulty find_stage (mismatch on second group color=1? to channel1 or2) and third group logic adding extras; makes no sense as it clutters the grid without clear sequence adherence.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, so basic seq extraction, single-group slot detection, stage matching, and single placement worked for simple case (likely m=1, clear match, no overlaps).
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated placed 1,1 blocks in rows 8/9, 12/13, 16/17 (with no second group), but expected has 1,1 in rows 7/8/9 (overlapping?), and 1,1 + 3,3 in rows 11/12; also empty where expected has placements (e.g., row 10 empty in generated vs. 1,1+3,3 in expected); differences: wrong vertical positions (step=h+2 misaligned?), missed second group fills (used channel 1 only?), stage match wrong (placed too many/early); slot parsing likely failed on multi-row or gap.
 * Train3: Incorrect—generated placed 2,2+3,3 in rows 12/13 (shifted down), 3,3+3,3 in 16/17 (same channel? overlapping colors), 3,3+4,4 in 20/21; expected has 2,2+3,3 in 10/11, 3,3+3,3 in 15/16, 3,3+4,4 in 20/21, with empties in 12-14/17-19; differences: placements shifted down by ~2 rows (wrong start_s or step), extra/wrong colors in second groups (e.g., 3,3 twice instead of matching seq), missed empties between; unknown why first placement offset, but likely step=h+2 too large or start_s wrong; get_existing_slot only first row caused uniform assumption fail.
 * Overall: Worked for seq/instructions (common to all), slot span detection (found h correctly), but failed on group parsing (single-row only, wrong w/gap for multi-group), stage matching (didn't try all channels or handle m>2), placement positioning (wrong shifts, overwrote empties), and filling (used fixed channels, no per-group seq); unhelpful: the placement loop assumes all groups after first use same second_j, but may need per-group channel; no bounds/overlap checks; for m=0, defaults but doesn't place anything useful.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct— it replicates blocks like 1x4 (cols13-16/18-21) in rows 4-7 (but input already has them in 4-6?, added in 7?), 4x4 + 2x4? in rows 10-13 (colors 4 and 2), 1x4 in rows 16-19, 4x4? (8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows on the left side (with colored indicators in specific columns) dictate the placement of multi-group colored shapes (rectangles or blocks) into a vertical slot area on the right side of the grid, starting from an existing "seed" placement and stacking additional placements above or below it while skipping one instruction row (the "stage") and accounting for gaps between groups. The goal is to fill the slot with shapes matching the instructions, using the background color to identify empty space, and ensuring placements don't overlap or exceed grid bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the dominant color (e.g., 1) in the top-left, used to detect non-empty cells and avoid overwriting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-indexed) that contain non-background colors in left columns (specifically columns 1, 3, 5), indicating colors for shape groups; these rows guide what colors to use for placements but are not part of the slot.
 * The slot is a vertical area starting from column 7 (0-indexed) to the right edge, where existing non-background groups (consecutive same-color runs) define the initial "seed" placement: track its starting row (start_s), height (h, spanning multiple rows if vertical), first group's start column (first_start), width (w, assumed uniform), gap between groups (s_gap, including any empty columns), and list of groups (each as (color, start_col, width)).
 * Placements stack vertically relative to the seed: for each instruction row (except the skipped "stage" one), compute a starting row by accumulating distances of (h + varying empty gaps, where gaps increase by 1 per level, e.g., s_gap + t for level t); placements go above if before skipped, below if after, but clip if out of bounds (return -1).
 * Stage detection: Match the seed's first group color to an instruction row's column 1 color; if multiple groups in seed, check where the second group's color appears in the instruction row (column 3 for "channel 2", column 5 for "channel 3") to identify the skipped instruction index (stage = i+1, skipped_i = stage-1).
 * For each non-skipped instruction: Use color from column 1 for the first group placement (at seed's first_start and w); if seed has >=2 groups, use secondary color (from column 3 or 5 based on channel) for second group (at its seed position); for a potential third group, infer its position after second + s_gap with width w, using the remaining column's color (the one not used for secondary).
 * Subtleties: Gaps between groups increase progressively (s_gap + t, where t is the level index); placements only overwrite background cells; if no seed (h=0 or m=0 groups), or no instructions, return the input grid unchanged; ensure column indices don't exceed n; the seed height h spans the min/max rows with right-side content; uniform width assumption for groups may not always hold but seems key here.
 * Easy-to-miss: compute_start must handle directions (above/below skipped_i) correctly with accumulating steps; third group placement is conditional (only if space allows and color != bg); channel logic swaps secondary/tertiary colors based on detection; output is a copy of input with only new placements added (no removal).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to pass 'n' or 'g' correctly to all functions to avoid scope errors; positioning is sensitive to 0-indexing and gap calculations (off-by-one common); placements must match exact seed geometry (positions, widths); if m<2, no second/third groups; validate against bounds strictly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding: correctly identifies background (1), instruction rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5 with colors in cols 1,3), seed slot (e.g., at rows 9-10 with groups of 2's and 3's starting col 11 width 2, gap inferred), stage (likely skipped first instruction, channel 2), and attempts placements with correct colors/groups (first group color from col1, second from col3, third inferred).
 * What worked: For train 3, it successfully placed shapes in the right area (cols 11-12 for first, 16-17 for second/third) with correct colors (e.g., 2's and 3's for second instruction, 3's and 3's for third? but mismatched, 3's and 4's for fourth); detected multiple groups and handled third placement; no overwriting of non-bg.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors in train 1,2, and test due to 'g' not defined in compute_start (uses len(g) without parameter); for train 3, placements are INCORRECT due to off-by-one row positioning (e.g., second instruction's 2,2|3,3 placed at rows 9-10 instead of expected 10-11; third instruction's 3,3|3,3 at 14-15 instead of ? but expected at 15-16; fourth at 20-21 correct); possibly wrong skipping (placed something resembling first instruction's colors but skipped incorrectly?); third group for second instruction uses 3 but expected no third or different; uniform w assumption holds but gap calc may be off (s_gap + t increasing correctly? unknown if exact mismatch cause).
 * compute_start is helpful but broken (missing g parameter, and logic for above/below may have off-by-one in dist accumulation, e.g., starting from wrong t range or step calc); program function copies grid correctly and integrates pieces well.
 * No other attempts, but this demonstrates core puzzle grasp (stacking with skip/gaps) but fails on execution and precise positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output results in an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so it does not run at all and cannot produce a meaningful grid; this makes no sense for the puzzle, as it prevents any placement logic from executing.
 * Without a generated grid, it's impossible to verify correctness, but based on train 3 patterns, the test likely has a similar setup (instructions on left, seed on right) requiring the same stacking/skipping; the error indicates the code isn't robust (scope issue in compute_start), so it would fail to handle test-specific seed position, instruction count, or gap variations.
 * To handle test, must fix parameter passing (add g to compute_start) and debug positioning (e.g., verify t ranges in loops, ensure start_s aligns with seed min_r exactly, test gap progression like s_gap=2, then 3, etc.).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (specific columns like 1,3,5 in odd rows) encodes multi-channel color sequences as instructions, which must be decoded and placed as stacked horizontal colored blocks (bars or groups) on the right side starting from column 7, matching and extending an existing partial structure while following spacing, skipping, and ordering rules to build a larger pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is determined from top-left cell; all placements only overwrite bg cells to avoid corrupting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1) that have non-bg cells in left columns [1,3,5]; sequences are extracted per channel (3 channels total) from these rows.
 * Existing slot on right (from col 7) defines initial structure: height h, first group start column first_start, width w, gap s_gap between groups, and list of groups (color, start_col, width); if no slot, do nothing.
 * "Stage" detection (skipped_i, second_channel) matches the first existing group's color to the first channel of some instruction i, then checks second group's color in channel 1 or 2 to decide ordering (second_channel=2 means place channel1 then channel2; =3 means place channel2 then channel1 if needed).
 * Placements stack vertically from start_s row, with base step = h + s_gap per instruction; skip one instruction (skipped_i) and don't shift its position; add +1 extra space (in vertical step) for the first instruction with 3 non-bg colors (first_three).
 * When placing for an instruction i: place channel0 always first at first_start with width w; for channels 1 and 2, use second_channel ordering, and if m>=2 (existing groups), use their positions/widths for the second placement, else use last_c + s_gap and width w; only place non-bg colors.
 * Vertical positions via compute_start_row must handle cases where i < skipped_i (negative shift) or i > skipped_i (positive cumulation), and incorporate the special +1 for first_three without double-counting or misaligning.
 * Edge cases: empty instructions (k=0), no slot (h=0 or m=0), out-of-bounds start_r + h > n (skip placement), instructions with 1-3 colors (m_list counts non-bg per i), gaps of 1 if no second group.
 * Subtle: compute_start_row's is_special lambda checks jj+1 == first_three (off-by-one?); cumulation must be precise to avoid row shifts; second_channel affects only the order of channels 1 and 2, not channel 0.
 * All placements are horizontal rectangles of uniform color, height h (copied from existing), but only up to n rows; no vertical stretching or rotation.
 * Puzzle goal: extend the right-side structure to match a "correct" stacked sequence without overlaps or misalignments, preserving left instructions and bg.

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- compute_start_row: Buggy in handling first_three special +1, leading to row shifts (e.g., cum not adjusting correctly for i around skipped_i or first_three); off-by-one in is_special (jj+1 == first_three?); doesn't handle negative shifts well if i < skipped_i.
- place_for_i: Logic for second_channel=3 swaps channels 1 and 2 but has redundant/conditional placement (placed_second flag), which may cause misordering if m<2; doesn't align widths/positions correctly when falling back to s_gap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 correct: Full sequence extraction, matching, and placement worked, including standard spacing and 2-channel ordering; no special 3-color case triggered.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places the final 1's+3's block starting at row 11 (with duplicates at 11-12, then 14-15), but expected starts it at row 10 (10-11, then 13-14); this is a vertical shift down by 1 row, likely due to compute_start_row misapplying the +1 special space for first_three (possibly not adding it or adding extra, causing cumulation error around skipped_i).
 * Training 2 also shows duplicate rows (e.g., generated rows 11=12, 14=15), suggesting place_for_i overwrites the same rows multiple times without vertical progression; expected has clean pairs without overlap.
 * Training 3 correct: Handled a case with swapped ordering (second_channel=3?) and possibly 3-color instruction, but without shift issues; indicates core matching and placement logic is solid except for spacing subtleties.
 * Missed precise cumulation in compute_start_row for cases where first_three is after skipped_i, leading to all subsequent positions offset.
 * find_stage works but defaults to (0,2) if no match, which may not skip correctly in edge cases.
 * get_existing_slot assumes uniform h across groups and parses only start_s row, which is fine if slot is solid but misses if groups have varying heights.
 * place_for_i's handling of m>=2 reuses exact group positions for second color, but for third always uses s_gap fallback; this worked in train1/3 but may not in cases with m=1.
 * Overall, sequence extraction and bg/slot detection are reliable; problem is in vertical positioning and channel ordering for multi-group placements.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this iteration shows partial understanding: passes simple cases but fails on special spacing/skipping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks at: rows 5-8 (mixed 1's and 4's/1's, irregular widths like four 1's with gaps); rows 10-13 (4's then 2's, four-wide each with gap); rows 15-18 (1's then 4's, similar); rows 20-23 (8's, four-wide, no second group); this follows the code's logic but looks over-dense/irregular compared to expected stacked uniform bars.
 * It does not look correct: Existing slot seems to be in rows 5-8 with 1's (possibly groups of color1 width4? but code placed extras); placements reuse h=4 but start_r computations likely misalign (e.g., rows 6-9 would be expected for second stack, but code puts at 10-13, suggesting same shift bug as train2); 8's at bottom have no gap/ordering, and row7 has stray 8 in col1? (may be input preservation).
 * Missing uniform widths/gaps (e.g., test input has potential w=4, s_gap=1, but placements have 1's in cols13-16,19-22,25-28? overlapping n=27); extra 1's in row5/6 suggest place_for_i placed channel1/2 without checking existing.
 * Does not account for test's larger n=27 and potential first_three (e.g., row5 has 3 colors? 1,4,1 but irregular); output has duplicates (rows6=7,10=11=12=13?,15=16=17=18?,20=21=22=23), indicating vertical cumulation failed entirely, stacking everything at wrong starts.
 * To fix for test: Debug compute_start_row to correctly add +1 only once for first_three in the cum loop, handle i < skipped_i without inverting steps, and ensure place_for_i skips if colr == bg or start_r out-of-bounds; verify slot parsing for test's potential multi-group in rows5-8 (1's at col13-16?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows (typically odd-numbered rows starting from row 1) provide color sequences in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) to guide the placement of colored block groups into an existing partial structure (slot) on the right side of the grid (starting from column 7). The goal is to extend or complete the structure by placing new groups according to the instructions, accounting for spacing, heights derived from existing widths, stages (which may skip instructions), and boundary conditions, while preserving the background and avoiding overwrites except in specific cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all placements must respect it by only overwriting background cells unless handling boundary sticking or clearing.
 * Instruction rows are identified as odd rows (1,3,5,...) with non-background colors in at least one of columns 1,3,5; each such row encodes a sequence of up to 3 colors for placement (first in col1, second/third in col3 or col5 based on stage/channel logic).
 * The right-side slot (columns 7+) may have an existing partial structure; detect its vertical extent (min_r to max_r), group consecutive same-color horizontal runs (color, start_col, width), and use the first group's width as the placement height (h_place = w), with step = w + gap between first and second group.
 * Stages determine which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1) and channel for second color (2 or 3, based on matching existing second group's color in instruction cols); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match.
 * Placement starts at an effective row (shifted up if partial and non-boundary, or handled specially if at bottom boundary); place full height h_place of blocks, but for boundary cases, place the skipped instruction at the top and clear sticking parts below to background.
 * Subtleties: If no existing groups (m=0), do nothing; placements skip out-of-bounds; third color placement assumes symmetric width w and position after second group + gap; partial structures shorter than h_place shift up by difference; bottom-boundary (max_r == n-1) requires special clearing of protruding parts after placing skipped instruction.
 * Handle cases with 0-3 groups in existing slot; for m=1, only place first color; for m>=2, place second/third based on channel; gaps (s_gap) are assumed constant or derived from first gap.
 * Grid size n x n, with n odd (e.g., 27); ensure placements don't exceed n; copy input grid to output and modify only as specified.
 * Easy to miss: Channel detection relies on matching existing colors exactly in instruction rows; if no match, defaults may lead to incorrect skipping; boundary clearing only for sticking parts in skipped placement.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Background detection is reliable and essential.

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
Accurately identifies instruction rows based on non-bg in left columns; useful for extracting sequences.

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = any(g[r][c] != bg for c in range(7, n))
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h_existing = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    if h_existing == 0:
        return min_r, max_r, h_existing, 7, 0, 1, [], 0
    row = g[start_s]  # Assumes uniform across height; may need vertical aggregation if not
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 7
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - groups[0][2] if m > 1 else 1
    return min_r, max_r, h_existing, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
Extracts existing slot bounds, groups, widths, and gaps; core for determining placement params, but assumes horizontal uniformity from first row—may fail if structure varies vertically.

```python
def find_stage(g: List[List[int]], instr_rows: List[int], bg: int, n: int, groups: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], m: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if m == 0:
        return 1, 2
    first_color = groups[0][0]
    k = len(instr_rows)
    for i in range(k):
        r = instr_rows[i]
        col0 = g[r][1] if 1 < n else bg
        if col0 == bg or col0 != first_color:
            continue
        if m <= 1:
            return i + 1, 2
        second_color = groups[1][0]
        col1 = g[r][3] if 3 < n else bg
        if col1 != bg and col1 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 2
        col2 = g[r][5] if 5 < n else bg
        if col2 != bg and col2 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 3
    return 1, 2
```
Determines stage (instruction index+1 to skip) and channel (2 or 3 for second color) by matching existing colors to instruction row signals; key for sequencing, but defaults to 1,2 if no full match—may skip incorrectly if partial matches.

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
Basic placement utility; only overwrites bg, which is safe but may not handle merging with existing non-bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly placing groups according to instructions, respecting stages, shifts, and boundaries.
 * Worked well for cases with existing partial structures (m>=1), instruction matching, and skipping logic, as evidenced by training passes.
 * get_existing_slot assumes structure is horizontally uniform from the top row of the slot, which worked in training but could miss vertical variations.
 * find_stage correctly defaults and matches channels, enabling proper second/third color placements in training.
 * Boundary handling (partial_non_boundary shift, partial_boundary clearing) was effective for training cases where structures touched the bottom.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_background, get_instruction_rows, get_existing_slot, find_stage, place_group) are relevant and contributed to training success, though get_existing_slot's row sampling may need enhancement for non-uniform vertical structures.
 * Sequence extraction in main program (pulling colors from left_cols per instr_row) is solid and directly used for placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows placements in multiple blocks: rows 5-8 have scattered 1's and a 4 in left/mid, plus a right-side structure of 1's in cols 13-16 and 18-21,23-26 (but incomplete/partial); rows 10-13 have 4's in cols 13-16 and 2's in 18-21; rows 15-18 have 1's in cols 13-16,18-21,23-26 but 4's in 23-26; rows 20-23 have 8's in cols 13-16.
 * Additional left-side elements: row1 has 1's in cols1,3,5; row3 has 4's in1,3 and 2 in5; row7 has 8 in1; row15-18 have 1's in left but 4's in right-end.
 * The output makes partial sense as an extension of an existing slot (assuming input had some base in cols13+), with heights of 4 (matching possible w=4 from groups like 1's/4's/2's/8's), steps around 4+gap, and placements skipping based on stage/channel (e.g., 8's placed separately, possibly skipped instruction).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: scattered left-side placements (e.g., row5:1,4,1; row6-9:1's in right but not fully grouped; row7:8 in left) suggest possible overwrites or incorrect instruction parsing, as instructions should only affect right slot—left should remain as input signals. Right structures have inconsistent gaps (e.g., col17 and22 are 3/bg between groups, but third placements in rows15-18 shift to 4's in col23+ without clear second group match). Bottom placements (rows20-23:8's) may indicate boundary sticking without proper clearing, leaving partial overlaps. Overall, while structured, the output has anomalies in positioning and left-side artifacts, differing from expected clean right-only extensions with uniform group heights/gaps; unknown if due to input specifics or code assumptions (e.g., vertical non-uniformity in slot detection).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) in odd rows guide the placement of colored block groups into an "existing slot" area on the right side (starting from column 7). The goal is to copy and arrange sequences from the instructions into the output grid, skipping one "stage" (instruction row), adjusting channel orders based on matching existing groups, and respecting spacing, heights, and widths derived from the slot analysis, while preserving the background and non-overwriting existing content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always at g[0][0] and assumed uniform; any non-background in the slot area defines existing groups.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered starting from row 1, selected only if they have non-background cells in left columns 1,3,5; empty instructions (k=0) result in no changes.
 * Sequences are extracted per channel (col 1,3,5) across instruction rows, treating out-of-bounds as background.
 * Existing slot analysis: Find the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7 (start_s, h=height); if none, h=0 and no placement. Then parse horizontal groups in the first row of the slot (start_s) from col 7: consecutive same-color runs become groups (color, start_col, width); gaps between groups are s_gap (min 1 if no second group).
 * Stage detection: Match the first instruction row's channel 0 color to the first existing group's color; if there's a second group, check channel 1 or 2 for its color to decide second_channel (2 or 3, meaning swap channels 1 and 2 for placement). Default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match. This determines which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1).
 * Placement: For each non-skipped instruction i, compute start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i) * step (step = h + s_gap); place up to 3 blocks per row block: channel0 at first_start, then channel_sec at +w+s_gap, channel_ter at +another w+s_gap, only if non-bg, using place_group which fills h rows x w cols but skips existing non-bg cells (only overwrites bg). Skip if start_r out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Placement can overlap or extend beyond n but is clipped; assumes all groups have same width w (from first group); if m=0 or h=0, no placement. Channels may be bg (skipped). Existing groups are preserved (place_group doesn't overwrite non-bg). Gaps and steps ensure alignment with existing layout. Odd rows only for instructions avoids even rows which may be spacers. Left_cols fixed at [1,3,5], assuming 3-channel max. Colors are integers, bg=3 in test.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g):
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color reliably.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g, bg, n):
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(Accurately identifies active odd instruction rows based on non-bg in left channels.)

```python
def get_sequence(g, bg, instruction_rows, left_cols, k):
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            color = g[r][c] if c < len(g[0]) else bg
            sequence[j].append(color)
    return sequence
```
(Extracts per-channel color sequences from instruction rows, handling bounds.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g, bg, n):
    # (Full function as in program; parses bounding rows and horizontal groups in slot row)
    # Returns start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(Comprehensive for finding slot position, height, and parsing existing groups' colors/positions/widths/gaps; essential for alignment and matching.)

```python
def find_stage(sequence, groups, m):
    # (Full function as in program; matches first seq channel to groups to set stage and second_channel)
    # Returns stage (1-based index to skip), second_channel (2 or 3 for channel swap)
```
(Key for deciding skip and channel order based on existing groups.)

```python
def place_group(g_out, start_r, h, start_c, width, color, bg, n):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
(Safe placement: only overwrites bg, clips to grid; preserves existing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided; no prior attempts summarized, but it demonstrates core understanding of instruction extraction, slot parsing, stage skipping, and multi-channel placement with gaps.
 * Worked perfectly for all 3 training examples (all CORRECT), indicating solid grasp of rules for those cases: likely simple sequences, matching stages, and placements without edge cases like out-of-bounds or empty slots.
 * get_existing_slot correctly handles empty slots (h=0, m=0 -> no change) and parses groups accurately for matching.
 * find_stage defaults sensibly to stage 1/channel 2 if no match, and handles m<=1.
 * place_group's overwrite-only-bg prevents corruption of existing content.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: assumes all groups share the same w and s_gap from first/second; if varying widths/gaps in slot, this may misalign (but training passed, so likely uniform).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant and functional for this puzzle. get_background is simple but essential. No broken functions observed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: it places blocks on the right (cols 13+), e.g., rows 5-8 have 1's in 13-16/18-21/23-26 (matching a sequence of 1's), rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (18-21), rows 15-18 have 1's (13-16/18-21) and 4's (23-26, suggesting channel swap), rows 20-23 have 8's (13-16), which aligns with extracting sequences from left instructions (e.g., row3:4/4/2? row5:1/4/1, row7:8/bg/bg?, etc.) and placing with skip (possibly skipping row1 or another), step~5 (h=4? +gap1), w=4, s_gap=1, first_start=13.
 * However, differences from expected: Input has existing 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16/18-21/23-26 (already placed?), but output copies more 1's there without overwriting (correct), but row7 col1=8 is instruction, yet placement starts at row5? (maybe start_s=5, stage=1 skip i=0, so first placement at 5+(1-0)*step=5+step? Wait, code has start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i)*step, for i=1 (after skip0) =5+1*step, but output places at 5-8 which is before? Mismatch—expected placements should shift down by step after skip, but output seems to place starting too early or without proper skip offset, overlapping existing without shift. Also, row15-18 places 4's at end (23-26), suggesting second_channel=3 swap, but why not in earlier blocks? And rows20-23 only one block of 8's (ch0=8, others bg?), but if sequence has more, missing channels. Bottom rows 24-26 all bg, possibly out-of-bounds clip. Overall, placements follow pattern but offset/skip seems incorrect (e.g., no clear skip gap of h+s_gap~5 rows; placements at 5-8,10-13? Wait 9 empty, then15-18 gap,20-23), suggesting bug in start_r calculation when skipped_i early or step miscomputed from existing h/s_gap. Existing in input rows5-8/10-13/15-18/20-23? Wait input not fully shown, but output adds to right without full alignment—likely partial match but wrong positioning, so not correct. Unknown why gaps are irregular (e.g., row9/14/19/24 empty), possibly failed bounds check.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Consistent Interconnections and Properties Across All Train Examples

The following are the only interactions, connections, or property relationships that are directly observable, obvious, and hold true in **every** train input/output pair (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to elements with clear, consistent effects or preservations. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Properties like color, position (bbox), size (pixels), and holes are considered where they demonstrably connect or affect other elements consistently. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific color transformations, variable shift distances, or semantic meanings) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact rules for generating new shapes) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Background Shape Interactions**
   - **Background color → No change**: The color of the background shape (Maroon in pairs 1 and 2; Blue in pair 3) remains identical from input to output. No interaction with other colors alters it.
   - **Background bbox → Preservation**: The bounding box ([0,0,22,22] in all train pairs) remains fixed from input to output, unaffected by added shapes.
   - **Added shapes (any) → Background holes**: The holes count in the background increases exactly by the number of new shapes (connected components) added in the output. 
     - Pair 1: +4 new shapes → holes 8 → 12.
     - Pair 2: +8 new shapes → holes 12 → 20.
     - Pair 3: +4 new shapes → holes 8 → 12.
   - **Added shapes pixels → Background pixels**: The pixels count in the background decreases exactly by the total pixels of all new shapes added in the output (no overlap or other effects).
     - Pair 1: +36 pixels added → 505 → 469.
     - Pair 2: +32 pixels added → 511 → 479.
     - Pair 3: +16 pixels added → 515 → 499.

#### 2. **Small Shapes (1-pixel) Interactions**
   - **Small shape position (bbox) → Preservation**: All 1-pixel shapes retain their exact bbox positions from input to output; no movement, addition, or removal of small shapes occurs.
     - Applies to all small Blues, Reds, Greens, and Yellows in top/mid rows (e.g., y=1,3,5,7 across pairs).
   - **Small shape color → Preservation**: The color of each 1-pixel shape remains unchanged from input to output.
   - **Small shape size (pixels=1, holes=0) → Preservation**: Size and holes for all 1-pixel shapes are fixed; no scaling or structural change.
   - **Small shapes → No interaction with other elements**: Small shapes do not affect, transform, or connect to background properties, large shapes, or new additions in any observable way (e.g., no consistent position/color influence on outputs).

#### 3. **Large Shapes (>1 pixel) Interactions**
   - **Large shape position (bbox) → Preservation for existing**: All input large shapes (>1 pixel, e.g., 4px or 9px) retain their exact bbox positions in the output; no movement or removal.
     - Pair 1: Yellow 9px shapes at [8,1,10,3] and [13,1,15,3] persist.
     - Pair 2: Red 4px shapes at [10,4,11,5] and [13,4,14,5] persist.
     - Pair 3: Green/Yellow 4px shapes at [11,20,12,21] and [16,20,17,21] persist.
   - **Large shape size (pixels, holes=0) → Preservation for existing**: Pixel count and holes=0 remain unchanged for input large shapes in output; no scaling.
   - **Large shape color → Preservation for existing**: Color of input large shapes remains the same in output.
   - **Input large shapes → Addition of new large shapes**: Existing large shapes consistently result in new large shapes being added in output (with matching size/pixels to input larges in that pair), but positions and colors of new shapes vary; transformation rule (e.g., how position/color of input large affects new ones) is unknown.
     - New shapes always have holes=0 and are "large" (pixels ≥4, consistent with input large sizes per pair).
     - No removal or alteration of existing larges.
   - **Large shapes → No direct interaction with small shapes**: No observable consistent effect between small and large shapes (e.g., no position/color propagation from small to large).

#### Notes on Scope
- **No other consistent interactions**: Elements like specific x/y shifts (e.g., +3 vs. +5), color mappings (e.g., Yellow/Red → Blue not universal), or hole counts in non-background shapes show no consistent connections across all pairs. New large shape generation is consistent in occurrence but unknown in mechanism.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Standalone properties (e.g., absolute positions without preservation/addition effects, variable grid spacings) or inconsistent ones (e.g., background color changes mentioned in high-level description but not in data) are not interactions.
- **Test input applicability**: These connections are derived solely from train pairs; no application or prediction for test input 1 is made.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:31:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (specific columns in odd rows) provides color sequences as instructions, and the right side (starting from column 7) requires placing patterned blocks based on those sequences, while accounting for any existing partial placements by skipping or adjusting the corresponding instruction step and mapping channels (sequences from columns 1,3,5) to positions with consistent widths and gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], used to identify non-empty cells and ignore fillers.
 * Instructions are only in odd rows starting from row 1, checked for non-background in columns 1,3,5; even rows or other columns are ignored for sequencing.
 * Sequences are extracted per channel (col 1,3,5) across k instruction rows, treating out-of-bounds as background.
 * Existing slot on right: Scan for non-background from col 7 rightward, find min/max rows for height h, then group consecutive same-color runs in the starting row of that slot (assuming uniform height across groups).
 * Stage finding: Match first group's color to channel 0's sequence; if more groups, match second to either channel 1 or 2 to determine channel mapping (2 or 3, affecting secondary/tertiary placements).
 * Placement: Skip the matched instruction index, then place subsequent blocks downward with step = h + gap (gap from existing groups), using fixed width w from first group, and positions offset by w + gap for secondary/tertiary channels; only overwrite background cells.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all groups in existing slot have same width w and height h; gap is between first and second group only (may not generalize if more varied).
 * If no existing slot (h=0 or m=0), do nothing (return copy of input).
 * n can be up to 27 (from output size), but placements clip to grid bounds.
 * Colors like 1,2,4,8 are placed; assumes no overwriting non-bg, but code only overwrites bg.
 * Potential miss: If existing groups have varying widths/heights, current grouping only analyzes first row and assumes uniformity.
 * Channel mapping: second_channel=2 means sec_idx=1 (col3 seq), ter_idx=2 (col5); =3 means sec=2 (col5), ter=1 (col3); this handles which sequence drives the second position.
 * Skipped index adjusts placement starts: start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i) * step, so placements shift up by step amount.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Extracts the background color reliably from top-left.

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
Identifies valid instruction rows (odd, with non-bg in left cols); essential for sequencing.

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j, c in enumerate(left_cols):
            color = g[r][c] if c < n else bg
            sequence[j].append(color)
    return sequence
```
Builds per-channel color lists from instructions; handles bounds safely.

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    if max_r < 0:
        return 0, 0, 7, 0, 1, [], 0
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 7
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - groups[0][2] if m > 1 else 1
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
Detects and analyzes existing right-side slot (height, start row, group colors/positions/widths, gap); assumes first row represents all, uses first group's w and gap to first-second; crucial for matching and placement params. No types defined, but returns unpacked tuple.

```python
def find_stage(sequence: List[List[int]], groups: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], m: int, k: int, bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if m == 0:
        return 0, 2
    first_color = groups[0][0]
    for i in range(k):
        if sequence[0][i] == first_color:
            if m <= 1:
                return i, 2
            second_color = groups[1][0]
            if sequence[1][i] == second_color:
                return i, 2
            if sequence[2][i] == second_color:
                return i, 3
    return 0, 2
```
Matches existing first/second groups to sequence step i and channel config (2 or 3); defaults to i=0, channel=2 if no match. Key for skipping and mapping.

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    end_r = min(n, start_r + h)
    end_c = min(n, start_c + width)
    for rr in range(max(0, start_r), end_r):
        for cc in range(max(0, start_c), end_c):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
Places a rectangular block only on bg cells, clipping to grid; used for each channel's position.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (and only detailed) attempt; no prior ones mentioned.
 * Worked: All three training examples passed correctly, indicating core logic for instruction extraction, sequence building, existing slot detection, stage matching, and placement with skipping/channel mapping handles standard cases well.
 * What worked: Background detection, row filtering for instructions, sequence per channel, grouping existing runs (assuming uniform), matching to skip index and set channel (2/3), stepping placements with h + gap, only overwriting bg.
 * What didn't: No explicit failures in training, but potential gaps in assumptions (e.g., varying group widths/heights not handled, as grouping only scans first row; default gap=1 if m<2; no match defaults to i=0 channel=2, which might overplace or misalign in edge cases).
 * Subtle issue: If existing slot spans non-consecutive rows or has bg inside, height h might be wrong (it takes min-max but assumes filled); grouping ignores bg gaps between groups correctly but uses only first w/gap.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though get_existing_slot could be broken if groups vary per row (e.g., doesn't verify uniformity across h rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows placements consistent with the code: e.g., rows 5-8 have 1's in cols 13-16 and 18-21,23-26 (suggesting w=4, gap=1, h=4 for some channel); row 7 col1=8 (possibly an instruction or outlier); rows 10-13 have 4's in 13-16 and 2's in 18-21 (h=4, similar pattern); rows 15-18 have 1's like rows 5-8 but 4's in 23-26 (shifted tertiary?); rows 20-23 have 8's in 13-16 (single channel placement, h=4).
 * Overall, it looks like multiple skipped/stepped placements on right (cols 13+), with bg=3 everywhere else, and left side unchanged (instructions intact, e.g., row1:1 in col1,3,5? Wait, output row1 has 1's in col1,3,5; row3:4 in1,4 in3,2 in5; row5:1 in1,4 in3,1 in5).
 * It makes sense per code rules: sequences from left (e.g., channel0: [1,4,1,?,1,?], but partial) placed with apparent skip (e.g., existing implied early, placements start lower), channel mapping varying (e.g., 1-4-1 pattern in some, 4-2 in others, 1-4, 8 alone).
 * However, without expected output, can't confirm full correctness, but no obvious errors (e.g., no overwrites of non-bg, placements rectangular/uniform); row7 col1=8 seems like input instruction not altered, but if it's a placement bleed, unknown—likely input. Rows 0,2,4,9,14,19,24-26 all bg, as expected for non-placement. Looks correct assuming training logic generalizes, but subtle if test has varying widths (code assumes fixed w from first group).

[2025-10-01 16:31:29] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties
The following lists only obvious, consistent connections and interactions between elements across **all** provided train examples (inputs and outputs). These are limited to properties that directly influence or relate to each other in every case, such as color propagation, positional persistence, size matching, and background adjustments. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., empty space, asymmetrical layouts without specific ties) are excluded. Inconsistent or varying interactions (e.g., exact y-position shifts, number of new additions, or propagation direction) are noted as unknown where they cannot be clearly tied.

#### Components Identified
- **Small 1x1 squares** (pixels=1, holes=0, bbox size=1x1): Clustered in left/low-x positions, multiple colors (e.g., yellow, blue, red, green). Always persist unchanged from input to output.
- **Large solid squares** (pixels>1, holes=0, bbox size>1x1, e.g., 2x2=4 pixels, 3x3=9 pixels, 4x4=16 pixels): Positioned in right/high-x columns, single color per square. Persist unchanged if present in input; new ones added in output.
- **Background** (large bbox covering full canvas, e.g., [0,0,22,22] or [0,0,26,26]; high pixels count; holes>0 in most cases): Solid color expanse (e.g., maroon, blue, green). Color persists unchanged. Holes and pixels adjust based on other components.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These occur in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). Connections are bidirectional where applicable (e.g., smalls affect larges, larges affect background).

1. **Small 1x1 squares → Color of new large solid squares**  
   - New large squares in the output are always colored using hues present in the small 1x1 squares from the input (e.g., blue added only if small blues exist; green added only if small greens exist).  
   - No new colors are introduced in larges beyond those in smalls. Existing large colors in input may repeat or not, but additions draw exclusively from smalls.  
   - Consistent across all: Train 1 (blues added from small blues), Train 2 (blues/greens added from small blues/greens), Train 3 (red/greens added from small reds/greens).

2. **Existing large solid squares → Size (pixels/bbox) of new large solid squares**  
   - All new large squares added in the output match the exact size (pixels count and bbox width/height) of any large squares present in the input (e.g., if input has 3x3/9 pixels, all new are 3x3/9; if 2x2/4, all new are 2x2/4).  
   - If no larges in input (none in examples, but implied consistency), unknown—but all examples have at least one size to match.  
   - Consistent across all: Train 1 (all 9 pixels), Train 2 (all 4 pixels), Train 3 (all 4 pixels).

3. **Existing large solid squares → x-position (bbox x-range) of new large solid squares**  
   - New large squares are always added in the same x-bbox ranges (columns) as existing large squares from the input, maintaining persistent "tracks" (e.g., if input has x=8-10 and x=13-15, new ones use those exact ranges).  
   - In cases where a new column appears (e.g., Train 2 adds x=16-17 alongside x=10-11/13-14), it is adjacent and tied to an existing one, but the core interaction is persistence of input x-ranges for most additions. No examples delete or shift existing x-ranges.  
   - Consistent across all: All new larges reuse input x-ranges (Train 1/3 fully; Train 2 partially with extension).

4. **All small and large squares → Background holes**  
   - Background holes = total number of small + large squares present (holes=0 for each square, but each "punches" one hole in background).  
   - Holes increase exactly by the number of new large squares added (smalls do not change).  
   - Consistent across all: Train 1 (+4 holes for 4 new larges), Train 2 (+8 holes for 8 new larges), Train 3 (+4 holes for 4 new larges). Initial holes in input match pre-existing square count.

5. **All small and large squares → Background pixels**  
   - Background pixels = total canvas pixels (e.g., 23x23=529 for bbox [0,0,22,22]; 27x27=729 for [0,0,26,26]) minus sum of all small + large pixels.  
   - Pixels decrease exactly by the total pixels of new large squares added (smalls do not change).  
   - Consistent across all: Matches hole increase (e.g., Train 1: -36 pixels for 4x9; Train 2: -32 pixels for 8x4; Train 3: -16 pixels for 4x4).

6. **Small and large squares → Background (persistence and no overlap)**  
   - All small and large squares persist unchanged in position, size, color, and holes=0 from input to output; only additions occur (no removals, transformations, or movements).  
   - Squares occupy space "within" the background (reducing its pixels/holes), but do not interact with background color (background color unchanged). No evidence of squares overlapping each other or background in a way that alters properties beyond pixel/hole subtraction.  
   - Consistent across all: Inputs' shapes identical in outputs; additions only affect background metrics.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Aspects (Not Forced)
- **y-position transformations**: New large y-bbox positions relative to existing larges or smalls vary (e.g., shifts up/down, gaps, stacking order); no consistent rule identifiable (e.g., Train 1 has gaps at y=4-5/9-10; Train 2 adds adjacent then offset; Train 3 stacks below original). Cannot explain without speculation.
- **Number of new large squares**: Varies (e.g., 4 in Train 1/3, 8 in Train 2); possibly tied to small pattern density/rows, but not obvious or consistent in a simple property link.
- **Arrangement beyond x-persistence**: Overall layout (e.g., left clustering of smalls, right placement of larges) is freeform and not tied to a consistent transformation (e.g., no uniform grid enforcement).
- **Background initial holes/pixels in input**: Vary (e.g., holes=8/12 in Train 1-2 vs. 8 in Train 3); match existing squares but no further interaction pattern.
- No connections involving holes in small/large squares (always 0, no effect). No consistent role for background color influencing others (persists but inert). Semantic meanings (e.g., "grid" vs. "freeform") not identifiable from data.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 16:32:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) provide color sequences for multiple "channels" (up to 3), and the goal is to place vertical stacks of colored blocks (shapes) into predefined slots on the right side (starting from column 7) according to the sequence order, while using an existing partial slot to determine which "stage" (sequence index) to skip or modify placement for, ensuring the output grid reflects completed placements without overwriting existing content or the background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells; only fill background cells (bg) with new colors.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered rows (starting from row 1) that have non-background colors in left columns [1,3,5]; these rows encode a sequence of k steps, where each step pulls colors from the three channels (col1 for primary, col3 for secondary, col5 for tertiary if present).
 * The right-side "slot" starts at column 7 and consists of vertical groups of colored blocks (e.g., runs of the same color horizontally); detect the existing partial slot by finding the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7, then parse horizontal groups within the first such row (color, start_col, width) to understand the shape template (e.g., multiple adjacent blocks with gaps).
 * The "stage" is determined by matching the first group's color in the existing slot to the earliest sequence position in channel 0 (col1), then checking if the second group matches channel 1 (col3) or channel 2 (col5) to decide the "second_channel" (2 or 3); this stage index indicates which sequence step to skip placing entirely.
 * Placements shift subsequent steps up or down by a fixed "step" distance (2*h - 1, where h is slot height) relative to the skipped stage's position, starting from the existing slot's row; each placement mirrors the existing slot's group structure (positions, widths, gaps) but uses sequence colors for that step, and only if the color != bg.
 * Subtlety: If m (number of groups) >=2, place second (and possibly third) groups using the appropriate channel's color for that step; third group only if second_channel is 3 (using channel 2) and its color != bg, positioned after a gap equal to s_gap (space between first and second group in existing slot).
 * Easy to miss: Placements must check bounds (r < n, c < n) and skip if start_row out of bounds or color == bg; existing slot parsing assumes groups are contiguous runs of non-bg starting from col 7, skipping bg gaps; sequences may have different lengths per channel, so use min(len) or check i < len(channel).
 * Across attempts: No rotation or shape transformation—shapes are axis-aligned vertical stacks mirroring the existing slot's horizontal group layout; no overwriting of instructions or left-side content; k can be variable based on instruction rows, and unused steps (after stage skip) may fall outside grid and be ignored.
 * Considerations: Grids are square (n x n), n=23 in examples; colors are small integers (1-8); existing slot may have 1-3 groups, with symmetric widths for second/third; step calculation ensures even spacing between placements (e.g., every other row block).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the bg color, used consistently.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(This accurately detects odd rows with instruction data in left columns, essential for extracting sequence.)

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            if c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] != bg:
                sequence[j].append(g[r][c])
    return sequence
```
(This extracts per-channel color lists from instruction rows, handling variable non-bg presence; core for sequence logic.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1 if max_r >= 0 else 0
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - w if m > 1 else 1
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 0
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(This parses the existing slot's bounding box, height, and group structure (color, start, width) from the first row; crucial for template matching and placement, though assumes single-row parsing—may need vertical consistency check.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core sequence extraction, slot detection, and basic placement/shifting logic works for simple cases (likely m=1 or straightforward stage match without third group).
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places extra 3,3 blocks in row 7 (positions ~16-17) where expected has bg (8,8), and mismatches in rows 10-11/13-14 by placing 1,1 blocks without the expected 3,3 in secondary slot position; also row 8 has 1,1,8,1,1,8,3,3 but expected lacks the 3,3—suggests over-placement of third group or wrong second_channel selection (chose 3 instead of 2?), and step shifting misaligns later steps (e.g., rows 10-11 should have 3,3 but generated has 8,8 there initially, then wrong in lower).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places shapes too early/low (e.g., rows 14-15 have 2,2 and 3,3 but expected has them in rows 10-11; rows 17-18 have 3,3 twice but expected has only one pair per block; rows 20-21 have 3,3,4,4 correctly positioned but generated misses vertical repetition or shifts wrong; also row 3 has extra 3,3,1,1 etc. in right side where expected is all bg—indicates faulty stage detection (find_stage returns wrong i+1,2 leading to skip=1 instead of later) and placement ignores h=2 for some blocks.
 * find_stage function is partially helpful but broken: it matches first_color to channel0 but assumes second_color match decides channel 2 vs 3; fails when m>=2 and sequences have varying lengths or no exact i match, defaulting to (1,2) which skips early step incorrectly; doesn't handle m=0 or no match (always falls back).
 * Placement loop in program() is helpful for shifting (start_row = start_s + (i - (stage-1)) * step) but buggy: skips i+1==stage correctly, but for m>=2 places second group always from channel1, overriding second_channel; third group only if second_channel_index==1 (wrong logic—should be if second_channel==3); also places over non-bg sometimes (if g_out[r][c] != bg check is there but may not prevent all overlaps); step=2*h-1 works for spacing but assumes even h and no bound clipping.
 * get_existing_slot is essential but assumes groups from first row only—may miss if existing slot has vertical variations; s_gap calculation is correct for positioning third but third_w assumes == second_w (subtlety: examples show symmetric, but confirm).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the third group placement condition (second_channel_index==1 and sequence[2][i] != bg) is inverted/wrong—leads to spurious placements in train2 (extra 3's) and misses in train3.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it places unexpected blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 in col1? No, cols 13-16:1,1,1,1 then 3,1,1,1,1,3—seems like early partial placements or misdetected slot start, but expected likely has no placements there as instructions are in rows1,3,5? Wait, test input not fully shown but generated has them where bg should be).
 * Rows 10-13: Places 4,4,4,4 in cols13-16 and 2,2,2,2 in 18-21 correctly positioned but repeated 4 times vertically (h=4?), matching a possible slot template, but if stage skip is wrong, this may overwrite or shift incorrectly—expected probably shifts to avoid overlap with input's existing in rows3-6 (input has 1's there).
 * Rows 17-20: Places another set of 1,1,1,1 /1,1,1,1 /3? but input already has similar in rows3-6, suggesting duplication without skip, or wrong step calculation leading to overlap; looks like it filled bg but ignored stage (possibly detected stage=1, skipping first but placing rest without proper shift, causing pile-up).
 * Overall, test output has too many placements (4 blocks instead of 3-4 sequence steps?) and ignores input's existing partial in rows3-6 (overwrites with more 1's), violating no-overwrite rule; does not match expected pattern of shifted completions around the existing slot—likely due to faulty find_stage (mismatch on second group color=1? to channel1 or2) and third group logic adding extras; makes no sense as it clutters the grid without clear sequence adherence.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instructions in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) on odd rows define color sequences for multiple "stages" or steps, and an existing solid-color rectangular slot (or multiple adjacent slots) on the right side (starting from column 7) needs to be detected and replicated vertically in other positions, filled with colors from the sequences, while skipping the stage where the original slot already matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is typically the dominant color in the top-left (g[0][0]), and all placements must avoid overwriting non-background elements outside the slots; instructions are only in odd rows (starting from row 1) with non-bg in left_cols=[1,3,5], and sequences are extracted per column across those rows.
 * Existing slot detection: Scan rows for non-bg in columns 7+ to find the vertical span (min_r to max_r, height h); then parse horizontal groups of consecutive same-color cells in the first row of that span (from col 7), assuming uniform solid rectangles across height h—subtlety: this assumes no variation within the slot height, but if the slot has internal patterns or bg gaps, it fails; gaps between groups (s_gap) are calculated from first row only, and m = number of groups (often 1 or 2 adjacent blocks).
 * Stage matching: Identify which instruction row index (stage = i+1) matches the existing slot by comparing first group's color to sequence[0][i], and if m>1, second group's color to sequence[1][i] or sequence[2][i] (trying channel 2 first, then 3); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match—subtlety: this is brittle if sequences have repeats or if m=0 (empty slot?); channels are 1-based (seq[0] for col1, etc.).
 * Placement: Copy the slot structure (positions, widths, gaps) vertically starting from the original start_s, using step = h + 2 (skipping one empty row between copies?); for each other stage i != stage, place at shifted row start_row = start_s + (i - stage) * step; fill each group jj with color from seq[j-1][i-1] where j=1 for first group, j=second_j (2 or 3) for others—subtlety: only fill if color != bg, and clip to grid bounds; placements can go above row 0 or below n (skipped), and must not overwrite instructions or other elements.
 * Subtle elements: Sequences may have different lengths per channel (len(seq[j]) may < k, so use bg if out-of-bounds); slot may have m=0 (no groups, default placement?); vertical stacking assumes fixed step=h+2, but this may not account for varying gaps or if empty rows are bg-only; in multi-group slots, all groups in a copy use the same channel's color? No, code uses j=1 for first, second_j for rest (assuming all subsequent groups use the same channel); grids are square n x n (23x23 in trains, 27x27 in test); preserve original grid, only overwrite slot areas.
 * Easy to miss: Slot parsing only uses first row of height, ignoring if lower rows differ (buggy for non-uniform slots); no validation that slot is solid across h; placements may overlap instructions or existing elements (code overwrites freely, but should avoid?); if stage matching fails, defaults poorly; k = len(instruction_rows), but indices are 0-based in seq, 1-based in stage.
 * Across attempts: Only train1 worked (likely simple single-group slot, correct stage match and 1 placement); trains 2/3 failed on multi-group slots or wrong positioning; test shows over-placement or wrong colors, ignoring bounds or gaps.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct, so basic seq extraction, single-group slot detection, stage matching, and single placement worked for simple case (likely m=1, clear match, no overlaps).
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated placed 1,1 blocks in rows 8/9, 12/13, 16/17 (with no second group), but expected has 1,1 in rows 7/8/9 (overlapping?), and 1,1 + 3,3 in rows 11/12; also empty where expected has placements (e.g., row 10 empty in generated vs. 1,1+3,3 in expected); differences: wrong vertical positions (step=h+2 misaligned?), missed second group fills (used channel 1 only?), stage match wrong (placed too many/early); slot parsing likely failed on multi-row or gap.
 * Train3: Incorrect—generated placed 2,2+3,3 in rows 12/13 (shifted down), 3,3+3,3 in 16/17 (same channel? overlapping colors), 3,3+4,4 in 20/21; expected has 2,2+3,3 in 10/11, 3,3+3,3 in 15/16, 3,3+4,4 in 20/21, with empties in 12-14/17-19; differences: placements shifted down by ~2 rows (wrong start_s or step), extra/wrong colors in second groups (e.g., 3,3 twice instead of matching seq), missed empties between; unknown why first placement offset, but likely step=h+2 too large or start_s wrong; get_existing_slot only first row caused uniform assumption fail.
 * Overall: Worked for seq/instructions (common to all), slot span detection (found h correctly), but failed on group parsing (single-row only, wrong w/gap for multi-group), stage matching (didn't try all channels or handle m>2), placement positioning (wrong shifts, overwrote empties), and filling (used fixed channels, no per-group seq); unhelpful: the placement loop assumes all groups after first use same second_j, but may need per-group channel; no bounds/overlap checks; for m=0, defaults but doesn't place anything useful.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct— it replicates blocks like 1x4 (cols13-16/18-21) in rows 4-7 (but input already has them in 4-6?, added in 7?), 4x4 + 2x4? in rows 10-13 (colors 4 and 2), 1x4 in rows 16-19, 4x4? (8's) in rows 22-25; but placements seem to fill existing areas (e.g., row7 adds 8 in col1? unrelated), wrong vertical spacing (clusters without h+2 gaps, e.g., rows4-7 continuous h=4? but step wrong), and extra 8's at bottom (new color not in seq?); differences from expected (inferred): likely should stack slots with gaps (e.g., empties between stages), match seq colors precisely (test seq from input: row1 col1=1,col3=1,col5=1? wait input row1:1,1,1 in left; row3:4,4,2?; row5:1,4,1?), skip original stage (around row4-6?), avoid overwriting instructions (row7 has 8 in col1, but left is instructions); doesn't make sense as it expands existing blocks downward without skipping original, adds unrelated 8's (bg? no bg=3), and ignores gaps—probably wrong stage match (defaulted to 1,2) and buggy slot parsing (treated multi as single, wrong w=4 but input has 1,1,1,1 separated by 3?).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows on the left side (with colored indicators in specific columns) dictate the placement of multi-group colored shapes (rectangles or blocks) into a vertical slot area on the right side of the grid, starting from an existing "seed" placement and stacking additional placements above or below it while skipping one instruction row (the "stage") and accounting for gaps between groups. The goal is to fill the slot with shapes matching the instructions, using the background color to identify empty space, and ensuring placements don't overlap or exceed grid bounds.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the dominant color (e.g., 1) in the top-left, used to detect non-empty cells and avoid overwriting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1, 0-indexed) that contain non-background colors in left columns (specifically columns 1, 3, 5), indicating colors for shape groups; these rows guide what colors to use for placements but are not part of the slot.
 * The slot is a vertical area starting from column 7 (0-indexed) to the right edge, where existing non-background groups (consecutive same-color runs) define the initial "seed" placement: track its starting row (start_s), height (h, spanning multiple rows if vertical), first group's start column (first_start), width (w, assumed uniform), gap between groups (s_gap, including any empty columns), and list of groups (each as (color, start_col, width)).
 * Placements stack vertically relative to the seed: for each instruction row (except the skipped "stage" one), compute a starting row by accumulating distances of (h + varying empty gaps, where gaps increase by 1 per level, e.g., s_gap + t for level t); placements go above if before skipped, below if after, but clip if out of bounds (return -1).
 * Stage detection: Match the seed's first group color to an instruction row's column 1 color; if multiple groups in seed, check where the second group's color appears in the instruction row (column 3 for "channel 2", column 5 for "channel 3") to identify the skipped instruction index (stage = i+1, skipped_i = stage-1).
 * For each non-skipped instruction: Use color from column 1 for the first group placement (at seed's first_start and w); if seed has >=2 groups, use secondary color (from column 3 or 5 based on channel) for second group (at its seed position); for a potential third group, infer its position after second + s_gap with width w, using the remaining column's color (the one not used for secondary).
 * Subtleties: Gaps between groups increase progressively (s_gap + t, where t is the level index); placements only overwrite background cells; if no seed (h=0 or m=0 groups), or no instructions, return the input grid unchanged; ensure column indices don't exceed n; the seed height h spans the min/max rows with right-side content; uniform width assumption for groups may not always hold but seems key here.
 * Easy-to-miss: compute_start must handle directions (above/below skipped_i) correctly with accumulating steps; third group placement is conditional (only if space allows and color != bg); channel logic swaps secondary/tertiary colors based on detection; output is a copy of input with only new placements added (no removal).
 * Considerations across attempts: Need to pass 'n' or 'g' correctly to all functions to avoid scope errors; positioning is sensitive to 0-indexing and gap calculations (off-by-one common); placements must match exact seed geometry (positions, widths); if m<2, no second/third groups; validate against bounds strictly.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding: correctly identifies background (1), instruction rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5 with colors in cols 1,3), seed slot (e.g., at rows 9-10 with groups of 2's and 3's starting col 11 width 2, gap inferred), stage (likely skipped first instruction, channel 2), and attempts placements with correct colors/groups (first group color from col1, second from col3, third inferred).
 * What worked: For train 3, it successfully placed shapes in the right area (cols 11-12 for first, 16-17 for second/third) with correct colors (e.g., 2's and 3's for second instruction, 3's and 3's for third? but mismatched, 3's and 4's for fourth); detected multiple groups and handled third placement; no overwriting of non-bg.
 * What didn't work: Execution errors in train 1,2, and test due to 'g' not defined in compute_start (uses len(g) without parameter); for train 3, placements are INCORRECT due to off-by-one row positioning (e.g., second instruction's 2,2|3,3 placed at rows 9-10 instead of expected 10-11; third instruction's 3,3|3,3 at 14-15 instead of ? but expected at 15-16; fourth at 20-21 correct); possibly wrong skipping (placed something resembling first instruction's colors but skipped incorrectly?); third group for second instruction uses 3 but expected no third or different; uniform w assumption holds but gap calc may be off (s_gap + t increasing correctly? unknown if exact mismatch cause).
 * compute_start is helpful but broken (missing g parameter, and logic for above/below may have off-by-one in dist accumulation, e.g., starting from wrong t range or step calc); program function copies grid correctly and integrates pieces well.
 * No other attempts, but this demonstrates core puzzle grasp (stacking with skip/gaps) but fails on execution and precise positioning.

**Test output:**
 * The test output results in an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so it does not run at all and cannot produce a meaningful grid; this makes no sense for the puzzle, as it prevents any placement logic from executing.
 * Without a generated grid, it's impossible to verify correctness, but based on train 3 patterns, the test likely has a similar setup (instructions on left, seed on right) requiring the same stacking/skipping; the error indicates the code isn't robust (scope issue in compute_start), so it would fail to handle test-specific seed position, instruction count, or gap variations.
 * To handle test, must fix parameter passing (add g to compute_start) and debug positioning (e.g., verify t ranges in loops, ensure start_s aligns with seed min_r exactly, test gap progression like s_gap=2, then 3, etc.).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (specific columns like 1,3,5 in odd rows) encodes multi-channel color sequences as instructions, which must be decoded and placed as stacked horizontal colored blocks (bars or groups) on the right side starting from column 7, matching and extending an existing partial structure while following spacing, skipping, and ordering rules to build a larger pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is determined from top-left cell; all placements only overwrite bg cells to avoid corrupting existing content.
 * Instruction rows are odd-indexed rows (starting from row 1) that have non-bg cells in left columns [1,3,5]; sequences are extracted per channel (3 channels total) from these rows.
 * Existing slot on right (from col 7) defines initial structure: height h, first group start column first_start, width w, gap s_gap between groups, and list of groups (color, start_col, width); if no slot, do nothing.
 * "Stage" detection (skipped_i, second_channel) matches the first existing group's color to the first channel of some instruction i, then checks second group's color in channel 1 or 2 to decide ordering (second_channel=2 means place channel1 then channel2; =3 means place channel2 then channel1 if needed).
 * Placements stack vertically from start_s row, with base step = h + s_gap per instruction; skip one instruction (skipped_i) and don't shift its position; add +1 extra space (in vertical step) for the first instruction with 3 non-bg colors (first_three).
 * When placing for an instruction i: place channel0 always first at first_start with width w; for channels 1 and 2, use second_channel ordering, and if m>=2 (existing groups), use their positions/widths for the second placement, else use last_c + s_gap and width w; only place non-bg colors.
 * Vertical positions via compute_start_row must handle cases where i < skipped_i (negative shift) or i > skipped_i (positive cumulation), and incorporate the special +1 for first_three without double-counting or misaligning.
 * Edge cases: empty instructions (k=0), no slot (h=0 or m=0), out-of-bounds start_r + h > n (skip placement), instructions with 1-3 colors (m_list counts non-bg per i), gaps of 1 if no second group.
 * Subtle: compute_start_row's is_special lambda checks jj+1 == first_three (off-by-one?); cumulation must be precise to avoid row shifts; second_channel affects only the order of channels 1 and 2, not channel 0.
 * All placements are horizontal rectangles of uniform color, height h (copied from existing), but only up to n rows; no vertical stretching or rotation.
 * Puzzle goal: extend the right-side structure to match a "correct" stacked sequence without overlaps or misalignments, preserving left instructions and bg.

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- compute_start_row: Buggy in handling first_three special +1, leading to row shifts (e.g., cum not adjusting correctly for i around skipped_i or first_three); off-by-one in is_special (jj+1 == first_three?); doesn't handle negative shifts well if i < skipped_i.
- place_for_i: Logic for second_channel=3 swaps channels 1 and 2 but has redundant/conditional placement (placed_second flag), which may cause misordering if m<2; doesn't align widths/positions correctly when falling back to s_gap.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 correct: Full sequence extraction, matching, and placement worked, including standard spacing and 2-channel ordering; no special 3-color case triggered.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places the final 1's+3's block starting at row 11 (with duplicates at 11-12, then 14-15), but expected starts it at row 10 (10-11, then 13-14); this is a vertical shift down by 1 row, likely due to compute_start_row misapplying the +1 special space for first_three (possibly not adding it or adding extra, causing cumulation error around skipped_i).
 * Training 2 also shows duplicate rows (e.g., generated rows 11=12, 14=15), suggesting place_for_i overwrites the same rows multiple times without vertical progression; expected has clean pairs without overlap.
 * Training 3 correct: Handled a case with swapped ordering (second_channel=3?) and possibly 3-color instruction, but without shift issues; indicates core matching and placement logic is solid except for spacing subtleties.
 * Missed precise cumulation in compute_start_row for cases where first_three is after skipped_i, leading to all subsequent positions offset.
 * find_stage works but defaults to (0,2) if no match, which may not skip correctly in edge cases.
 * get_existing_slot assumes uniform h across groups and parses only start_s row, which is fine if slot is solid but misses if groups have varying heights.
 * place_for_i's handling of m>=2 reuses exact group positions for second color, but for third always uses s_gap fallback; this worked in train1/3 but may not in cases with m=1.
 * Overall, sequence extraction and bg/slot detection are reliable; problem is in vertical positioning and channel ordering for multi-group placements.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this iteration shows partial understanding: passes simple cases but fails on special spacing/skipping.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks at: rows 5-8 (mixed 1's and 4's/1's, irregular widths like four 1's with gaps); rows 10-13 (4's then 2's, four-wide each with gap); rows 15-18 (1's then 4's, similar); rows 20-23 (8's, four-wide, no second group); this follows the code's logic but looks over-dense/irregular compared to expected stacked uniform bars.
 * It does not look correct: Existing slot seems to be in rows 5-8 with 1's (possibly groups of color1 width4? but code placed extras); placements reuse h=4 but start_r computations likely misalign (e.g., rows 6-9 would be expected for second stack, but code puts at 10-13, suggesting same shift bug as train2); 8's at bottom have no gap/ordering, and row7 has stray 8 in col1? (may be input preservation).
 * Missing uniform widths/gaps (e.g., test input has potential w=4, s_gap=1, but placements have 1's in cols13-16,19-22,25-28? overlapping n=27); extra 1's in row5/6 suggest place_for_i placed channel1/2 without checking existing.
 * Does not account for test's larger n=27 and potential first_three (e.g., row5 has 3 colors? 1,4,1 but irregular); output has duplicates (rows6=7,10=11=12=13?,15=16=17=18?,20=21=22=23), indicating vertical cumulation failed entirely, stacking everything at wrong starts.
 * To fix for test: Debug compute_start_row to correctly add +1 only once for first_three in the cum loop, handle i < skipped_i without inverting steps, and ensure place_for_i skips if colr == bg or start_r out-of-bounds; verify slot parsing for test's potential multi-group in rows5-8 (1's at col13-16?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where instruction rows (typically odd-numbered rows starting from row 1) provide color sequences in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) to guide the placement of colored block groups into an existing partial structure (slot) on the right side of the grid (starting from column 7). The goal is to extend or complete the structure by placing new groups according to the instructions, accounting for spacing, heights derived from existing widths, stages (which may skip instructions), and boundary conditions, while preserving the background and avoiding overwrites except in specific cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (g[0][0]), and all placements must respect it by only overwriting background cells unless handling boundary sticking or clearing.
 * Instruction rows are identified as odd rows (1,3,5,...) with non-background colors in at least one of columns 1,3,5; each such row encodes a sequence of up to 3 colors for placement (first in col1, second/third in col3 or col5 based on stage/channel logic).
 * The right-side slot (columns 7+) may have an existing partial structure; detect its vertical extent (min_r to max_r), group consecutive same-color horizontal runs (color, start_col, width), and use the first group's width as the placement height (h_place = w), with step = w + gap between first and second group.
 * Stages determine which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1) and channel for second color (2 or 3, based on matching existing second group's color in instruction cols); default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match.
 * Placement starts at an effective row (shifted up if partial and non-boundary, or handled specially if at bottom boundary); place full height h_place of blocks, but for boundary cases, place the skipped instruction at the top and clear sticking parts below to background.
 * Subtleties: If no existing groups (m=0), do nothing; placements skip out-of-bounds; third color placement assumes symmetric width w and position after second group + gap; partial structures shorter than h_place shift up by difference; bottom-boundary (max_r == n-1) requires special clearing of protruding parts after placing skipped instruction.
 * Handle cases with 0-3 groups in existing slot; for m=1, only place first color; for m>=2, place second/third based on channel; gaps (s_gap) are assumed constant or derived from first gap.
 * Grid size n x n, with n odd (e.g., 27); ensure placements don't exceed n; copy input grid to output and modify only as specified.
 * Easy to miss: Channel detection relies on matching existing colors exactly in instruction rows; if no match, defaults may lead to incorrect skipping; boundary clearing only for sticking parts in skipped placement.

Extracts existing slot bounds, groups, widths, and gaps; core for determining placement params, but assumes horizontal uniformity from first row—may fail if structure varies vertically.

```python
def find_stage(g: List[List[int]], instr_rows: List[int], bg: int, n: int, groups: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], m: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if m == 0:
        return 1, 2
    first_color = groups[0][0]
    k = len(instr_rows)
    for i in range(k):
        r = instr_rows[i]
        col0 = g[r][1] if 1 < n else bg
        if col0 == bg or col0 != first_color:
            continue
        if m <= 1:
            return i + 1, 2
        second_color = groups[1][0]
        col1 = g[r][3] if 3 < n else bg
        if col1 != bg and col1 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 2
        col2 = g[r][5] if 5 < n else bg
        if col2 != bg and col2 == second_color:
            return i + 1, 3
    return 1, 2
```
Determines stage (instruction index+1 to skip) and channel (2 or 3 for second color) by matching existing colors to instruction row signals; key for sequencing, but defaults to 1,2 if no full match—may skip incorrectly if partial matches.

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
Basic placement utility; only overwrites bg, which is safe but may not handle merging with existing non-bg.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly placing groups according to instructions, respecting stages, shifts, and boundaries.
 * Worked well for cases with existing partial structures (m>=1), instruction matching, and skipping logic, as evidenced by training passes.
 * get_existing_slot assumes structure is horizontally uniform from the top row of the slot, which worked in training but could miss vertical variations.
 * find_stage correctly defaults and matches channels, enabling proper second/third color placements in training.
 * Boundary handling (partial_non_boundary shift, partial_boundary clearing) was effective for training cases where structures touched the bottom.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_background, get_instruction_rows, get_existing_slot, find_stage, place_group) are relevant and contributed to training success, though get_existing_slot's row sampling may need enhancement for non-uniform vertical structures.
 * Sequence extraction in main program (pulling colors from left_cols per instr_row) is solid and directly used for placements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows placements in multiple blocks: rows 5-8 have scattered 1's and a 4 in left/mid, plus a right-side structure of 1's in cols 13-16 and 18-21,23-26 (but incomplete/partial); rows 10-13 have 4's in cols 13-16 and 2's in 18-21; rows 15-18 have 1's in cols 13-16,18-21,23-26 but 4's in 23-26; rows 20-23 have 8's in cols 13-16.
 * Additional left-side elements: row1 has 1's in cols1,3,5; row3 has 4's in1,3 and 2 in5; row7 has 8 in1; row15-18 have 1's in left but 4's in right-end.
 * The output makes partial sense as an extension of an existing slot (assuming input had some base in cols13+), with heights of 4 (matching possible w=4 from groups like 1's/4's/2's/8's), steps around 4+gap, and placements skipping based on stage/channel (e.g., 8's placed separately, possibly skipped instruction).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: scattered left-side placements (e.g., row5:1,4,1; row6-9:1's in right but not fully grouped; row7:8 in left) suggest possible overwrites or incorrect instruction parsing, as instructions should only affect right slot—left should remain as input signals. Right structures have inconsistent gaps (e.g., col17 and22 are 3/bg between groups, but third placements in rows15-18 shift to 4's in col23+ without clear second group match). Bottom placements (rows20-23:8's) may indicate boundary sticking without proper clearing, leaving partial overlaps. Overall, while structured, the output has anomalies in positioning and left-side artifacts, differing from expected clean right-only extensions with uniform group heights/gaps; unknown if due to input specifics or code assumptions (e.g., vertical non-uniformity in slot detection).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers) where instructions encoded in specific left-side columns (1, 3, 5) in odd rows guide the placement of colored block groups into an "existing slot" area on the right side (starting from column 7). The goal is to copy and arrange sequences from the instructions into the output grid, skipping one "stage" (instruction row), adjusting channel orders based on matching existing groups, and respecting spacing, heights, and widths derived from the slot analysis, while preserving the background and non-overwriting existing content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always at g[0][0] and assumed uniform; any non-background in the slot area defines existing groups.
 * Instruction rows are odd-numbered starting from row 1, selected only if they have non-background cells in left columns 1,3,5; empty instructions (k=0) result in no changes.
 * Sequences are extracted per channel (col 1,3,5) across instruction rows, treating out-of-bounds as background.
 * Existing slot analysis: Find the minimal bounding rows with non-bg in cols >=7 (start_s, h=height); if none, h=0 and no placement. Then parse horizontal groups in the first row of the slot (start_s) from col 7: consecutive same-color runs become groups (color, start_col, width); gaps between groups are s_gap (min 1 if no second group).
 * Stage detection: Match the first instruction row's channel 0 color to the first existing group's color; if there's a second group, check channel 1 or 2 for its color to decide second_channel (2 or 3, meaning swap channels 1 and 2 for placement). Default to stage 1, channel 2 if no match. This determines which instruction row to skip (skipped_i = stage-1).
 * Placement: For each non-skipped instruction i, compute start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i) * step (step = h + s_gap); place up to 3 blocks per row block: channel0 at first_start, then channel_sec at +w+s_gap, channel_ter at +another w+s_gap, only if non-bg, using place_group which fills h rows x w cols but skips existing non-bg cells (only overwrites bg). Skip if start_r out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Placement can overlap or extend beyond n but is clipped; assumes all groups have same width w (from first group); if m=0 or h=0, no placement. Channels may be bg (skipped). Existing groups are preserved (place_group doesn't overwrite non-bg). Gaps and steps ensure alignment with existing layout. Odd rows only for instructions avoids even rows which may be spacers. Left_cols fixed at [1,3,5], assuming 3-channel max. Colors are integers, bg=3 in test.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g):
    return g[0][0]
```
(Extracts uniform background color reliably.)

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g, bg, n):
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
(Accurately identifies active odd instruction rows based on non-bg in left channels.)

```python
def get_sequence(g, bg, instruction_rows, left_cols, k):
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j in range(len(left_cols)):
            c = left_cols[j]
            color = g[r][c] if c < len(g[0]) else bg
            sequence[j].append(color)
    return sequence
```
(Extracts per-channel color sequences from instruction rows, handling bounds.)

```python
def get_existing_slot(g, bg, n):
    # (Full function as in program; parses bounding rows and horizontal groups in slot row)
    # Returns start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
(Comprehensive for finding slot position, height, and parsing existing groups' colors/positions/widths/gaps; essential for alignment and matching.)

```python
def find_stage(sequence, groups, m):
    # (Full function as in program; matches first seq channel to groups to set stage and second_channel)
    # Returns stage (1-based index to skip), second_channel (2 or 3 for channel swap)
```
(Key for deciding skip and channel order based on existing groups.)

```python
def place_group(g_out, start_r, h, start_c, width, color, bg, n):
    for rr in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, n)):
        for cc in range(start_c, min(start_c + width, n)):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
(Safe placement: only overwrites bg, clips to grid; preserves existing.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed program provided; no prior attempts summarized, but it demonstrates core understanding of instruction extraction, slot parsing, stage skipping, and multi-channel placement with gaps.
 * Worked perfectly for all 3 training examples (all CORRECT), indicating solid grasp of rules for those cases: likely simple sequences, matching stages, and placements without edge cases like out-of-bounds or empty slots.
 * get_existing_slot correctly handles empty slots (h=0, m=0 -> no change) and parses groups accurately for matching.
 * find_stage defaults sensibly to stage 1/channel 2 if no match, and handles m<=1.
 * place_group's overwrite-only-bg prevents corruption of existing content.
 * Potential subtlety missed in general: assumes all groups share the same w and s_gap from first/second; if varying widths/gaps in slot, this may misalign (but training passed, so likely uniform).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant and functional for this puzzle. get_background is simple but essential. No broken functions observed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct based on mental simulation of rules: it places blocks on the right (cols 13+), e.g., rows 5-8 have 1's in 13-16/18-21/23-26 (matching a sequence of 1's), rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (18-21), rows 15-18 have 1's (13-16/18-21) and 4's (23-26, suggesting channel swap), rows 20-23 have 8's (13-16), which aligns with extracting sequences from left instructions (e.g., row3:4/4/2? row5:1/4/1, row7:8/bg/bg?, etc.) and placing with skip (possibly skipping row1 or another), step~5 (h=4? +gap1), w=4, s_gap=1, first_start=13.
 * However, differences from expected: Input has existing 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16/18-21/23-26 (already placed?), but output copies more 1's there without overwriting (correct), but row7 col1=8 is instruction, yet placement starts at row5? (maybe start_s=5, stage=1 skip i=0, so first placement at 5+(1-0)*step=5+step? Wait, code has start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i)*step, for i=1 (after skip0) =5+1*step, but output places at 5-8 which is before? Mismatch—expected placements should shift down by step after skip, but output seems to place starting too early or without proper skip offset, overlapping existing without shift. Also, row15-18 places 4's at end (23-26), suggesting second_channel=3 swap, but why not in earlier blocks? And rows20-23 only one block of 8's (ch0=8, others bg?), but if sequence has more, missing channels. Bottom rows 24-26 all bg, possibly out-of-bounds clip. Overall, placements follow pattern but offset/skip seems incorrect (e.g., no clear skip gap of h+s_gap~5 rows; placements at 5-8,10-13? Wait 9 empty, then15-18 gap,20-23), suggesting bug in start_r calculation when skipped_i early or step miscomputed from existing h/s_gap. Existing in input rows5-8/10-13/15-18/20-23? Wait input not fully shown, but output adds to right without full alignment—likely partial match but wrong positioning, so not correct. Unknown why gaps are irregular (e.g., row9/14/19/24 empty), possibly failed bounds check.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the left side (specific columns in odd rows) provides color sequences as instructions, and the right side (starting from column 7) requires placing patterned blocks based on those sequences, while accounting for any existing partial placements by skipping or adjusting the corresponding instruction step and mapping channels (sequences from columns 1,3,5) to positions with consistent widths and gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the value at g[0][0], used to identify non-empty cells and ignore fillers.
 * Instructions are only in odd rows starting from row 1, checked for non-background in columns 1,3,5; even rows or other columns are ignored for sequencing.
 * Sequences are extracted per channel (col 1,3,5) across k instruction rows, treating out-of-bounds as background.
 * Existing slot on right: Scan for non-background from col 7 rightward, find min/max rows for height h, then group consecutive same-color runs in the starting row of that slot (assuming uniform height across groups).
 * Stage finding: Match first group's color to channel 0's sequence; if more groups, match second to either channel 1 or 2 to determine channel mapping (2 or 3, affecting secondary/tertiary placements).
 * Placement: Skip the matched instruction index, then place subsequent blocks downward with step = h + gap (gap from existing groups), using fixed width w from first group, and positions offset by w + gap for secondary/tertiary channels; only overwrite background cells.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all groups in existing slot have same width w and height h; gap is between first and second group only (may not generalize if more varied).
 * If no existing slot (h=0 or m=0), do nothing (return copy of input).
 * n can be up to 27 (from output size), but placements clip to grid bounds.
 * Colors like 1,2,4,8 are placed; assumes no overwriting non-bg, but code only overwrites bg.
 * Potential miss: If existing groups have varying widths/heights, current grouping only analyzes first row and assumes uniformity.
 * Channel mapping: second_channel=2 means sec_idx=1 (col3 seq), ter_idx=2 (col5); =3 means sec=2 (col5), ter=1 (col3); this handles which sequence drives the second position.
 * Skipped index adjusts placement starts: start_r = start_s + (i - skipped_i) * step, so placements shift up by step amount.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
Extracts the background color reliably from top-left.

```python
def get_instruction_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3, 5]
    instruction_rows = []
    for r in range(1, n, 2):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in left_cols:
            if c < n and g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            instruction_rows.append(r)
    return instruction_rows
```
Identifies valid instruction rows (odd, with non-bg in left cols); essential for sequencing.

```python
def get_sequence(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, instruction_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    sequence = [[] for _ in left_cols]
    for i in range(k):
        r = instruction_rows[i]
        for j, c in enumerate(left_cols):
            color = g[r][c] if c < n else bg
            sequence[j].append(color)
    return sequence
```
Builds per-channel color lists from instructions; handles bounds safely.

```python
def get_existing_slot(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]], int]:
    min_r = n
    max_r = -1
    for r in range(n):
        has_non_bg = False
        for c in range(7, n):
            if g[r][c] != bg:
                has_non_bg = True
                break
        if has_non_bg:
            min_r = min(min_r, r)
            max_r = max(max_r, r)
    if max_r < 0:
        return 0, 0, 7, 0, 1, [], 0
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    start_s = min_r
    row = g[start_s]
    groups = []
    i = 7
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            color = row[i]
            start_c = i
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                i += 1
            width = i - start_c
            groups.append((color, start_c, width))
        else:
            i += 1
    m = len(groups)
    first_start = groups[0][1] if m > 0 else 7
    w = groups[0][2] if m > 0 else 0
    s_gap = groups[1][1] - groups[0][1] - groups[0][2] if m > 1 else 1
    return start_s, h, first_start, w, s_gap, groups, m
```
Detects and analyzes existing right-side slot (height, start row, group colors/positions/widths, gap); assumes first row represents all, uses first group's w and gap to first-second; crucial for matching and placement params. No types defined, but returns unpacked tuple.

```python
def find_stage(sequence: List[List[int]], groups: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], m: int, k: int, bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if m == 0:
        return 0, 2
    first_color = groups[0][0]
    for i in range(k):
        if sequence[0][i] == first_color:
            if m <= 1:
                return i, 2
            second_color = groups[1][0]
            if sequence[1][i] == second_color:
                return i, 2
            if sequence[2][i] == second_color:
                return i, 3
    return 0, 2
```
Matches existing first/second groups to sequence step i and channel config (2 or 3); defaults to i=0, channel=2 if no match. Key for skipping and mapping.

```python
def place_group(g_out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, width: int, color: int, bg: int, n: int):
    end_r = min(n, start_r + h)
    end_c = min(n, start_c + width)
    for rr in range(max(0, start_r), end_r):
        for cc in range(max(0, start_c), end_c):
            if g_out[rr][cc] == bg:
                g_out[rr][cc] = color
```
Places a rectangular block only on bg cells, clipping to grid; used for each channel's position.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the provided last (and only detailed) attempt; no prior ones mentioned.
 * Worked: All three training examples passed correctly, indicating core logic for instruction extraction, sequence building, existing slot detection, stage matching, and placement with skipping/channel mapping handles standard cases well.
 * What worked: Background detection, row filtering for instructions, sequence per channel, grouping existing runs (assuming uniform), matching to skip index and set channel (2/3), stepping placements with h + gap, only overwriting bg.
 * What didn't: No explicit failures in training, but potential gaps in assumptions (e.g., varying group widths/heights not handled, as grouping only scans first row; default gap=1 if m<2; no match defaults to i=0 channel=2, which might overplace or misalign in edge cases).
 * Subtle issue: If existing slot spans non-consecutive rows or has bg inside, height h might be wrong (it takes min-max but assumes filled); grouping ignores bg gaps between groups correctly but uses only first w/gap.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided are relevant, though get_existing_slot could be broken if groups vary per row (e.g., doesn't verify uniformity across h rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows placements consistent with the code: e.g., rows 5-8 have 1's in cols 13-16 and 18-21,23-26 (suggesting w=4, gap=1, h=4 for some channel); row 7 col1=8 (possibly an instruction or outlier); rows 10-13 have 4's in 13-16 and 2's in 18-21 (h=4, similar pattern); rows 15-18 have 1's like rows 5-8 but 4's in 23-26 (shifted tertiary?); rows 20-23 have 8's in 13-16 (single channel placement, h=4).
 * Overall, it looks like multiple skipped/stepped placements on right (cols 13+), with bg=3 everywhere else, and left side unchanged (instructions intact, e.g., row1:1 in col1,3,5? Wait, output row1 has 1's in col1,3,5; row3:4 in1,4 in3,2 in5; row5:1 in1,4 in3,1 in5).
 * It makes sense per code rules: sequences from left (e.g., channel0: [1,4,1,?,1,?], but partial) placed with apparent skip (e.g., existing implied early, placements start lower), channel mapping varying (e.g., 1-4-1 pattern in some, 4-2 in others, 1-4, 8 alone).
 * However, without expected output, can't confirm full correctness, but no obvious errors (e.g., no overwrites of non-bg, placements rectangular/uniform); row7 col1=8 seems like input instruction not altered, but if it's a placement bleed, unknown—likely input. Rows 0,2,4,9,14,19,24-26 all bg, as expected for non-placement. Looks correct assuming training logic generalizes, but subtle if test has varying widths (code assumes fixed w from first group).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Interconnected Components and Properties
The following lists only obvious, consistent connections and interactions between elements across **all** provided train examples (inputs and outputs). These are limited to properties that directly influence or relate to each other in every case, such as color propagation, positional persistence, size matching, and background adjustments. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., empty space, asymmetrical layouts without specific ties) are excluded. Inconsistent or varying interactions (e.g., exact y-position shifts, number of new additions, or propagation direction) are noted as unknown where they cannot be clearly tied.

#### Components Identified
- **Small 1x1 squares** (pixels=1, holes=0, bbox size=1x1): Clustered in left/low-x positions, multiple colors (e.g., yellow, blue, red, green). Always persist unchanged from input to output.
- **Large solid squares** (pixels>1, holes=0, bbox size>1x1, e.g., 2x2=4 pixels, 3x3=9 pixels, 4x4=16 pixels): Positioned in right/high-x columns, single color per square. Persist unchanged if present in input; new ones added in output.
- **Background** (large bbox covering full canvas, e.g., [0,0,22,22] or [0,0,26,26]; high pixels count; holes>0 in most cases): Solid color expanse (e.g., maroon, blue, green). Color persists unchanged. Holes and pixels adjust based on other components.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These occur in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). Connections are bidirectional where applicable (e.g., smalls affect larges, larges affect background).

1. **Small 1x1 squares → Color of new large solid squares**  
   - New large squares in the output are always colored using hues present in the small 1x1 squares from the input (e.g., blue added only if small blues exist; green added only if small greens exist).  
   - No new colors are introduced in larges beyond those in smalls. Existing large colors in input may repeat or not, but additions draw exclusively from smalls.  
   - Consistent across all: Train 1 (blues added from small blues), Train 2 (blues/greens added from small blues/greens), Train 3 (red/greens added from small reds/greens).

2. **Existing large solid squares → Size (pixels/bbox) of new large solid squares**  
   - All new large squares added in the output match the exact size (pixels count and bbox width/height) of any large squares present in the input (e.g., if input has 3x3/9 pixels, all new are 3x3/9; if 2x2/4, all new are 2x2/4).  
   - If no larges in input (none in examples, but implied consistency), unknown—but all examples have at least one size to match.  
   - Consistent across all: Train 1 (all 9 pixels), Train 2 (all 4 pixels), Train 3 (all 4 pixels).

3. **Existing large solid squares → x-position (bbox x-range) of new large solid squares**  
   - New large squares are always added in the same x-bbox ranges (columns) as existing large squares from the input, maintaining persistent "tracks" (e.g., if input has x=8-10 and x=13-15, new ones use those exact ranges).  
   - In cases where a new column appears (e.g., Train 2 adds x=16-17 alongside x=10-11/13-14), it is adjacent and tied to an existing one, but the core interaction is persistence of input x-ranges for most additions. No examples delete or shift existing x-ranges.  
   - Consistent across all: All new larges reuse input x-ranges (Train 1/3 fully; Train 2 partially with extension).

4. **All small and large squares → Background holes**  
   - Background holes = total number of small + large squares present (holes=0 for each square, but each "punches" one hole in background).  
   - Holes increase exactly by the number of new large squares added (smalls do not change).  
   - Consistent across all: Train 1 (+4 holes for 4 new larges), Train 2 (+8 holes for 8 new larges), Train 3 (+4 holes for 4 new larges). Initial holes in input match pre-existing square count.

5. **All small and large squares → Background pixels**  
   - Background pixels = total canvas pixels (e.g., 23x23=529 for bbox [0,0,22,22]; 27x27=729 for [0,0,26,26]) minus sum of all small + large pixels.  
   - Pixels decrease exactly by the total pixels of new large squares added (smalls do not change).  
   - Consistent across all: Matches hole increase (e.g., Train 1: -36 pixels for 4x9; Train 2: -32 pixels for 8x4; Train 3: -16 pixels for 4x4).

6. **Small and large squares → Background (persistence and no overlap)**  
   - All small and large squares persist unchanged in position, size, color, and holes=0 from input to output; only additions occur (no removals, transformations, or movements).  
   - Squares occupy space "within" the background (reducing its pixels/holes), but do not interact with background color (background color unchanged). No evidence of squares overlapping each other or background in a way that alters properties beyond pixel/hole subtraction.  
   - Consistent across all: Inputs' shapes identical in outputs; additions only affect background metrics.

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Aspects (Not Forced)
- **y-position transformations**: New large y-bbox positions relative to existing larges or smalls vary (e.g., shifts up/down, gaps, stacking order); no consistent rule identifiable (e.g., Train 1 has gaps at y=4-5/9-10; Train 2 adds adjacent then offset; Train 3 stacks below original). Cannot explain without speculation.
- **Number of new large squares**: Varies (e.g., 4 in Train 1/3, 8 in Train 2); possibly tied to small pattern density/rows, but not obvious or consistent in a simple property link.
- **Arrangement beyond x-persistence**: Overall layout (e.g., left clustering of smalls, right placement of larges) is freeform and not tied to a consistent transformation (e.g., no uniform grid enforcement).
- **Background initial holes/pixels in input**: Vary (e.g., holes=8/12 in Train 1-2 vs. 8 in Train 3); match existing squares but no further interaction pattern.
- No connections involving holes in small/large squares (always 0, no effect). No consistent role for background color influencing others (persists but inert). Semantic meanings (e.g., "grid" vs. "freeform") not identifiable from data.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
