=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 06:19:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 06:44:22] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[tuple]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

[2025-10-03 06:44:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 07:12:43] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 07:13:17] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists of integers representing visual elements like shapes, objects, or patterns), where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes training examples and a test input to produce correct outputs, possibly extracting or classifying objects based on puzzle rules. The previous attempt failed entirely due to a structural issue in the generated code, preventing any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function, as its absence causes immediate validation errors across all examples; this is a core structural requirement, not related to puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid patterns for objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, or connected components), with rules for extraction, counting features like holes or connections, and matching against expected outputs—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or incomplete spans across the grid.
 * Training examples are provided to infer rules (e.g., what constitutes a valid object or transformation), and the test input must be processed similarly without overfitting; subtle elements include omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching criteria like hole count) and ensuring outputs exactly match expected formats.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle logic was tested due to errors, but future attempts should include functions for grid parsing (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) and validation against training data; watch for mismatches in blob shapes, object omission, or grid boundaries that could alter connectivity.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must be deterministic and exact (no approximations); grids may have noise or separators that need filtering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function and any puzzle-specific logic. Future attempts should include grid-processing utilities like those below for object extraction.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful type for puzzle elements (not from previous attempt)
class PuzzleObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but recommended for future use)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[PuzzleObject]:
    # Use flood-fill or DFS to find connected components/objects in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []  # Collect positions
                # Implement DFS or BFS here to trace connected cells
                # Count holes if needed (e.g., enclosed zeros)
                hole_count = 0  # Placeholder: implement hole detection
                objects.append(PuzzleObject(component, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated code completely omitted the required 'program' function, leading to errors in all training examples and the test input—no puzzle logic was executed or evaluated.
 * No object extraction or grid processing was possible, so issues like blob shape mismatches, object omission (e.g., based on hole count or validity), or handling dividers/separators could not be assessed.
 * No helpful functions were provided; any future code without 'program' is structurally broken and irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * Training examples 1-3 all failed identically due to the missing function, indicating a total lack of adherence to code format requirements—subtle puzzle rules (e.g., connectivity in grids) remain untested.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the puzzle, as even basic validation failed for unknown reasons related to code generation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates invalid code rather than a puzzle solution (e.g., no processed grid output, object list, or classification).
 * It is different from expected because a valid test output should apply inferred puzzle rules to the test grid (e.g., extracting and describing objects like shapes with holes), but nothing was generated—likely missing key elements like object positions, counts, or matches to training patterns.
 * This error prevents checking if the test handles subtleties like unique grid configurations (e.g., non-spanning keys or irregular objects), confirming the output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[tuple]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 07:23:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:

            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 07:23:56] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists of integers representing visual elements like shapes, objects, or patterns), where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes training examples and a test input to produce correct outputs, possibly extracting or classifying objects based on puzzle rules. The previous attempt failed entirely due to a structural issue in the generated code, preventing any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function, as its absence causes immediate validation errors across all examples; this is a core structural requirement, not related to puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid patterns for objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, or connected components), with rules for extraction, counting features like holes or connections, and matching against expected outputs—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or incomplete spans across the grid.
 * Training examples are provided to infer rules (e.g., what constitutes a valid object or transformation), and the test input must be processed similarly without overfitting; subtle elements include omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching criteria like hole count) and ensuring outputs exactly match expected formats.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle logic was tested due to errors, but future attempts should include functions for grid parsing (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) and validation against training data; watch for mismatches in blob shapes, object omission, or grid boundaries that could alter connectivity.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must be deterministic and exact (no approximations); grids may have noise or separators that need filtering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function and any puzzle-specific logic. Future attempts should include grid-processing utilities like those below for object extraction.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful type for puzzle elements (not from previous attempt)
class PuzzleObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but recommended for future use)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[PuzzleObject]:
    # Use flood-fill or DFS to find connected components/objects in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []  # Collect positions
                # Implement DFS or BFS here to trace connected cells
                # Count holes if needed (e.g., enclosed zeros)
                hole_count = 0  # Placeholder: implement hole detection
                objects.append(PuzzleObject(component, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated code completely omitted the required 'program' function, leading to errors in all training examples and the test input—no puzzle logic was executed or evaluated.
 * No object extraction or grid processing was possible, so issues like blob shape mismatches, object omission (e.g., based on hole count or validity), or handling dividers/separators could not be assessed.
 * No helpful functions were provided; any future code without 'program' is structurally broken and irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * Training examples 1-3 all failed identically due to the missing function, indicating a total lack of adherence to code format requirements—subtle puzzle rules (e.g., connectivity in grids) remain untested.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the puzzle, as even basic validation failed for unknown reasons related to code generation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates invalid code rather than a puzzle solution (e.g., no processed grid output, object list, or classification).
 * It is different from expected because a valid test output should apply inferred puzzle rules to the test grid (e.g., extracting and describing objects like shapes with holes), but nothing was generated—likely missing key elements like object positions, counts, or matches to training patterns.
 * This error prevents checking if the test handles subtleties like unique grid configurations (e.g., non-spanning keys or irregular objects), confirming the output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[tuple]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.

 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 07:28:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 likely as a special case or background) where the goal is to detect and extend patterns of horizontal blocks and vertical "tracks" (likely signal columns) to place additional colored blocks in empty spaces, following rules for anchoring, gaps, and subsequence matching to complete a symmetric or patterned output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) must be correctly identified as the uniform row color or default to top-left; it's crucial for distinguishing signals and blocks from empty space, but the code mishandles cases where bg is 0.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (odd indices) with exactly one non-bg cell per column to qualify as signals; multiple consecutive non-bg cells disqualify them, enforcing isolated signal points.
 * Signal rows are those containing any non-bg cell in a track; colors in these rows (per track) form sequences that must match block color patterns via subsequence checking.
 * Horizontal blocks are consecutive non-bg cells of the same color in rows, but only those of length >=2 are considered; all blocks must have consistent height h (vertical span), or the puzzle fails validation.
 * Anchoring involves sliding a window of height h over rows to find where existing blocks' colors form a subsequence matching one signal color sequence; this anchors the pattern for extensions.
 * Placement extends blocks forward/backward from the anchor using steps (df=2h-1 forward, db=2h+1 backward), with fixed gaps between blocks; new blocks are placed only in bg cells, but overplacement or out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Subtleties: Assumes consistent h across blocks (inconsistent leads to no-op return); subsequence matching is loose (allows extra elements in signal); gaps are fixed from initial blocks; odd-column bias for tracks may miss even-column signals; 0/bg confusion in validation (e.g., "cell == 0 or cell == g[0][0] and g[0][0] == 0" is buggy); no rotation or vertical blocks considered; assumes square grid.
 * Edge cases: No tracks/signals/blocks result in unchanged grid; extension stops at grid edges; multiple signals per row/track not handled beyond collection; colors must be uniform per block vertically/horizontally.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for isolation.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):  # Odd columns only
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                if consec > max_consec:
                    max_consec = consec
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts signal tracks with isolated non-bg cells; helpful but assumes odd columns and single-cell isolation.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                signal_set.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))

def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(These collect signal positions and per-row color sequences from tracks; essential for pattern matching, but assumes one color per track per row.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(This finds horizontal block spans of same color >=2 wide; useful for detecting existing patterns, but collects across all rows without vertical consistency check.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence checker; key for matching block colors to signals, allows non-contiguous matches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt failed completely due to syntax errors (invalid code like stray "wait no..." comment in find_anchor at line ~88), preventing any execution or output generation.
 * What worked: Basic structure for extracting bg, tracks, signals, and blocks is logically sound and puzzle-aligned; subsequence matching and gap calculation capture core pattern extension ideas.
 * What didn't work: Syntax errors caused total failure (no outputs generated); find_anchor has incomplete/broken validation logic (e.g., unfinished bg checks, assumes uniform h without enforcement); placement logic (extend_ranges_for_placement, place_at) is overly rigid (fixed steps df/db, gap-based extension) and doesn't handle variable gaps, rotations, or non-odd tracks; no handling for multiple anchors or failed matches beyond no-op; assumes all blocks same height h, which may not hold; ignores even columns for tracks, potentially missing signals.
 * anchor finding (find_anchor) is broken/not helpful due to syntax and vague validation (e.g., skips bg cells incorrectly, doesn't enforce vertical uniformity properly); don't use in future without fixes.
 * get_gap and extend_ranges_for_placement are partially helpful for spacing but assume fixed gaps and forward-only extension, which may not fit puzzle symmetries.
 * Overall, the attempt shows partial understanding of signal/block detection but fails on integration and execution; training examples all errored identically, indicating no progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error due to syntax, so no grid is generated; this does not make sense or match any expected puzzle completion, as the program doesn't run to produce a modified grid.
 * Without valid execution, cannot verify if placements align with test input's patterns (e.g., expected block extensions or signal matches); the error prevents any comparison, confirming the output is incorrect and unhelpful.
 * To handle test cases, future attempts must fix syntax, add robust error handling for inconsistent h/gaps, and validate against expected symmetric placements (e.g., mirroring signals around anchor).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 07:28:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists of integers representing visual elements like shapes, objects, or patterns), where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes training examples and a test input to produce correct outputs, possibly extracting or classifying objects based on puzzle rules. The previous attempt failed entirely due to a structural issue in the generated code, preventing any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function, as its absence causes immediate validation errors across all examples; this is a core structural requirement, not related to puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid patterns for objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, or connected components), with rules for extraction, counting features like holes or connections, and matching against expected outputs—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or incomplete spans across the grid.
 * Training examples are provided to infer rules (e.g., what constitutes a valid object or transformation), and the test input must be processed similarly without overfitting; subtle elements include omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching criteria like hole count) and ensuring outputs exactly match expected formats.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle logic was tested due to errors, but future attempts should include functions for grid parsing (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) and validation against training data; watch for mismatches in blob shapes, object omission, or grid boundaries that could alter connectivity.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must be deterministic and exact (no approximations); grids may have noise or separators that need filtering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function and any puzzle-specific logic. Future attempts should include grid-processing utilities like those below for object extraction.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful type for puzzle elements (not from previous attempt)
class PuzzleObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but recommended for future use)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[PuzzleObject]:
    # Use flood-fill or DFS to find connected components/objects in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []  # Collect positions
                # Implement DFS or BFS here to trace connected cells
                # Count holes if needed (e.g., enclosed zeros)
                hole_count = 0  # Placeholder: implement hole detection
                objects.append(PuzzleObject(component, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated code completely omitted the required 'program' function, leading to errors in all training examples and the test input—no puzzle logic was executed or evaluated.
 * No object extraction or grid processing was possible, so issues like blob shape mismatches, object omission (e.g., based on hole count or validity), or handling dividers/separators could not be assessed.
 * No helpful functions were provided; any future code without 'program' is structurally broken and irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * Training examples 1-3 all failed identically due to the missing function, indicating a total lack of adherence to code format requirements—subtle puzzle rules (e.g., connectivity in grids) remain untested.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the puzzle, as even basic validation failed for unknown reasons related to code generation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates invalid code rather than a puzzle solution (e.g., no processed grid output, object list, or classification).
 * It is different from expected because a valid test output should apply inferred puzzle rules to the test grid (e.g., extracting and describing objects like shapes with holes), but nothing was generated—likely missing key elements like object positions, counts, or matches to training patterns.
 * This error prevents checking if the test handles subtleties like unique grid configurations (e.g., non-spanning keys or irregular objects), confirming the output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

 * Background color (bg) must be correctly identified as the uniform row color or default to top-left; it's crucial for distinguishing signals and blocks from empty space, but the code mishandles cases where bg is 0.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (odd indices) with exactly one non-bg cell per column to qualify as signals; multiple consecutive non-bg cells disqualify them, enforcing isolated signal points.
 * Signal rows are those containing any non-bg cell in a track; colors in these rows (per track) form sequences that must match block color patterns via subsequence checking.
 * Horizontal blocks are consecutive non-bg cells of the same color in rows, but only those of length >=2 are considered; all blocks must have consistent height h (vertical span), or the puzzle fails validation.
 * Anchoring involves sliding a window of height h over rows to find where existing blocks' colors form a subsequence matching one signal color sequence; this anchors the pattern for extensions.
 * Placement extends blocks forward/backward from the anchor using steps (df=2h-1 forward, db=2h+1 backward), with fixed gaps between blocks; new blocks are placed only in bg cells, but overplacement or out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Subtleties: Assumes consistent h across blocks (inconsistent leads to no-op return); subsequence matching is loose (allows extra elements in signal); gaps are fixed from initial blocks; odd-column bias for tracks may miss even-column signals; 0/bg confusion in validation (e.g., "cell == 0 or cell == g[0][0] and g[0][0] == 0" is buggy); no rotation or vertical blocks considered; assumes square grid.
 * Edge cases: No tracks/signals/blocks result in unchanged grid; extension stops at grid edges; multiple signals per row/track not handled beyond collection; colors must be uniform per block vertically/horizontally.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for isolation.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):  # Odd columns only
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                if consec > max_consec:
                    max_consec = consec
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts signal tracks with isolated non-bg cells; helpful but assumes odd columns and single-cell isolation.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                signal_set.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))

def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(These collect signal positions and per-row color sequences from tracks; essential for pattern matching, but assumes one color per track per row.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(This finds horizontal block spans of same color >=2 wide; useful for detecting existing patterns, but collects across all rows without vertical consistency check.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence checker; key for matching block colors to signals, allows non-contiguous matches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt failed completely due to syntax errors (invalid code like stray "wait no..." comment in find_anchor at line ~88), preventing any execution or output generation.
 * What worked: Basic structure for extracting bg, tracks, signals, and blocks is logically sound and puzzle-aligned; subsequence matching and gap calculation capture core pattern extension ideas.
 * What didn't work: Syntax errors caused total failure (no outputs generated); find_anchor has incomplete/broken validation logic (e.g., unfinished bg checks, assumes uniform h without enforcement); placement logic (extend_ranges_for_placement, place_at) is overly rigid (fixed steps df/db, gap-based extension) and doesn't handle variable gaps, rotations, or non-odd tracks; no handling for multiple anchors or failed matches beyond no-op; assumes all blocks same height h, which may not hold; ignores even columns for tracks, potentially missing signals.
 * anchor finding (find_anchor) is broken/not helpful due to syntax and vague validation (e.g., skips bg cells incorrectly, doesn't enforce vertical uniformity properly); don't use in future without fixes.
 * get_gap and extend_ranges_for_placement are partially helpful for spacing but assume fixed gaps and forward-only extension, which may not fit puzzle symmetries.
 * Overall, the attempt shows partial understanding of signal/block detection but fails on integration and execution; training examples all errored identically, indicating no progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error due to syntax, so no grid is generated; this does not make sense or match any expected puzzle completion, as the program doesn't run to produce a modified grid.
 * Without valid execution, cannot verify if placements align with test input's patterns (e.g., expected block extensions or signal matches); the error prevents any comparison, confirming the output is incorrect and unhelpful.
 * To handle test cases, future attempts must fix syntax, add robust error handling for inconsistent h/gaps, and validate against expected symmetric placements (e.g., mirroring signals around anchor).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[tuple]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 07:36:33] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)

        if len(row) == size and all(x == row[0] for x in row):
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]

```
(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 07:37:31] Response:
### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns that hold across all cases without exception, using properties like color, position, size (via pixels or bbox), and holes. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific colors not affecting others consistently, unique positions without cross-example links) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent effects (e.g., exact rules for new shape creation, color-specific transformations like yellow-to-blue that do not occur in every example) are noted as such but not speculated upon.

#### 1. **Foreground Shapes → Background (Holes and Pixels)**
   - **Description**: Every added foreground shape (new components appearing only in the output, with holes=0) consistently increases the background's hole count by exactly 1 per added shape and decreases the background's pixel count by exactly the added shape's pixel count.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Foreground: holes=0, pixels (e.g., 4, 9), bbox position/size.
     - Background: holes (increases by # of added shapes), pixels (decreases by sum of added shapes' pixels), color (unchanged).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: 4 added shapes (each 9 pixels) → holes +4 (8→12), pixels -36 (505→469).
     - Train 2: 8 added shapes (each 4 pixels) → holes +8 (12→20), pixels -32 (511→479).
     - Train 3: 4 added shapes (each 4 pixels) → holes +4 (8→12), pixels -16 (515→499).
   - **Notes**: This is a direct causal interaction (addition of foreground affects background metrics). No other hole changes occur. Background bbox remains fixed ([0,0,22,22] across trains).

#### 2. **Input Foreground Shapes → Output Foreground Shapes (Preservation)**
   - **Description**: All existing foreground shapes from the input (small 1-pixel or larger) are consistently preserved identically in the output, with no changes to their properties.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Color (e.g., yellow, blue, red, green): unchanged.
     - Position (bbox coordinates): identical.
     - Size (pixels): identical (e.g., 1, 4, 9).
     - Holes: remain 0.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: All 8 small 1-pixel (yellow/blue) and 2 larger 9-pixel (yellow) preserved exactly.
     - Train 2: All 12 small 1-pixel (red/blue/green) and 2 larger 4-pixel (red) preserved exactly.
     - Train 3: All 6 small 1-pixel (red/green/yellow) and 2 larger 4-pixel (green/yellow) preserved exactly.
   - **Notes**: This is an identity interaction (input shapes directly map to output without alteration). Applies to all foreground components, regardless of color or size. No position-based movement or transformation of existing shapes occurs consistently.

#### 3. **Grid Positions → Component Alignment (Across Foreground and Background)**
   - **Description**: All foreground shapes (input and output) align consistently to an integer grid defined by odd-numbered coordinates (e.g., columns 1,3,5,...; rows 1,3,5,... for small shapes; even/odd spans for larger), which interacts with the background's fixed bbox to maintain spatial consistency.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox x/y starts/ends): Snapped to grid (e.g., width/height spans like 1-unit for 1-pixel, 3-units for 9-pixel, 4-units for 16-pixel in test but consistent sizing in trains).
     - Background: Fixed bbox ([0,0,22,22]) encloses all, with no shift.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Small at (1,1),(3,1),(1,3),(3,3),(1,5),(3,5); larger at col 8-10/13-15, row 1-3/6-8/11-13 (grid-aligned spans).
     - Train 2: Small at col 1/3/5, row 1/3/5/7; larger at col 10-11/13-14/16-17, row 4-5/7-8/10-11/13-14 (grid-aligned).
     - Train 3: Small at col 1/3, row 1/3/5; larger at col 11-12/16-17, row 10-11/15-16/20-21 (grid-aligned).
   - **Notes**: This is a positional constraint interaction (grid enforces alignment for all components). Background bbox provides the enclosing frame. No color or size effects on grid positioning are consistent across all.

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Connections Noted
- Color → transformation (e.g., input yellow/red/green to output blue/green/red): Occurs but not consistent (e.g., blue added in Train 1/2 but red in Train 3; no uniform rule like "change to blue" in every case).
- Position → new shape creation (e.g., small grid positions influencing added large shape locations): Positions correlate with additions (e.g., vertical shifts down), but exact mapping (e.g., offset amounts like +5 rows) varies and cannot be explained consistently without speculation.
- Size (pixels) → color or position effects: Larger shapes (4/9 pixels) are preserved but their input size does not consistently dictate output additions (e.g., 9-pixel in Train 1 adds 9-pixel; 4-pixel in Train 2/3 adds 4-pixel, but no cross-size interaction).
- Background color → foreground: Background color (maroon/blue) unchanged and does not consistently affect foreground colors or positions (e.g., no "maroon avoidance" rule evident in all).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., holes in foreground=0 always but no effect on others; silhouettes/edges not derivable from data) were identifiable without forcing connections. The test input was not used for identification, as instructions specify consistency across train examples only.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 07:37:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on patterns that hold across all cases without exception, using properties like color, position, size (via pixels or bbox), and holes. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific colors not affecting others consistently, unique positions without cross-example links) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent effects (e.g., exact rules for new shape creation, color-specific transformations like yellow-to-blue that do not occur in every example) are noted as such but not speculated upon.

#### 1. **Foreground Shapes → Background (Holes and Pixels)**
   - **Description**: Every added foreground shape (new components appearing only in the output, with holes=0) consistently increases the background's hole count by exactly 1 per added shape and decreases the background's pixel count by exactly the added shape's pixel count.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Foreground: holes=0, pixels (e.g., 4, 9), bbox position/size.
     - Background: holes (increases by # of added shapes), pixels (decreases by sum of added shapes' pixels), color (unchanged).
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: 4 added shapes (each 9 pixels) → holes +4 (8→12), pixels -36 (505→469).
     - Train 2: 8 added shapes (each 4 pixels) → holes +8 (12→20), pixels -32 (511→479).
     - Train 3: 4 added shapes (each 4 pixels) → holes +4 (8→12), pixels -16 (515→499).
   - **Notes**: This is a direct causal interaction (addition of foreground affects background metrics). No other hole changes occur. Background bbox remains fixed ([0,0,22,22] across trains).

#### 2. **Input Foreground Shapes → Output Foreground Shapes (Preservation)**
   - **Description**: All existing foreground shapes from the input (small 1-pixel or larger) are consistently preserved identically in the output, with no changes to their properties.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Color (e.g., yellow, blue, red, green): unchanged.
     - Position (bbox coordinates): identical.
     - Size (pixels): identical (e.g., 1, 4, 9).
     - Holes: remain 0.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: All 8 small 1-pixel (yellow/blue) and 2 larger 9-pixel (yellow) preserved exactly.
     - Train 2: All 12 small 1-pixel (red/blue/green) and 2 larger 4-pixel (red) preserved exactly.
     - Train 3: All 6 small 1-pixel (red/green/yellow) and 2 larger 4-pixel (green/yellow) preserved exactly.
   - **Notes**: This is an identity interaction (input shapes directly map to output without alteration). Applies to all foreground components, regardless of color or size. No position-based movement or transformation of existing shapes occurs consistently.

#### 3. **Grid Positions → Component Alignment (Across Foreground and Background)**
   - **Description**: All foreground shapes (input and output) align consistently to an integer grid defined by odd-numbered coordinates (e.g., columns 1,3,5,...; rows 1,3,5,... for small shapes; even/odd spans for larger), which interacts with the background's fixed bbox to maintain spatial consistency.
   - **Properties Involved**:
     - Position (bbox x/y starts/ends): Snapped to grid (e.g., width/height spans like 1-unit for 1-pixel, 3-units for 9-pixel, 4-units for 16-pixel in test but consistent sizing in trains).
     - Background: Fixed bbox ([0,0,22,22]) encloses all, with no shift.
   - **Consistency Evidence**:
     - Train 1: Small at (1,1),(3,1),(1,3),(3,3),(1,5),(3,5); larger at col 8-10/13-15, row 1-3/6-8/11-13 (grid-aligned spans).
     - Train 2: Small at col 1/3/5, row 1/3/5/7; larger at col 10-11/13-14/16-17, row 4-5/7-8/10-11/13-14 (grid-aligned).
     - Train 3: Small at col 1/3, row 1/3/5; larger at col 11-12/16-17, row 10-11/15-16/20-21 (grid-aligned).
   - **Notes**: This is a positional constraint interaction (grid enforces alignment for all components). Background bbox provides the enclosing frame. No color or size effects on grid positioning are consistent across all.

#### Unknown/Inconsistent Connections Noted
- Color → transformation (e.g., input yellow/red/green to output blue/green/red): Occurs but not consistent (e.g., blue added in Train 1/2 but red in Train 3; no uniform rule like "change to blue" in every case).
- Position → new shape creation (e.g., small grid positions influencing added large shape locations): Positions correlate with additions (e.g., vertical shifts down), but exact mapping (e.g., offset amounts like +5 rows) varies and cannot be explained consistently without speculation.
- Size (pixels) → color or position effects: Larger shapes (4/9 pixels) are preserved but their input size does not consistently dictate output additions (e.g., 9-pixel in Train 1 adds 9-pixel; 4-pixel in Train 2/3 adds 4-pixel, but no cross-size interaction).
- Background color → foreground: Background color (maroon/blue) unchanged and does not consistently affect foreground colors or positions (e.g., no "maroon avoidance" rule evident in all).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., holes in foreground=0 always but no effect on others; silhouettes/edges not derivable from data) were identifiable without forcing connections. The test input was not used for identification, as instructions specify consistency across train examples only.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 07:47:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Counts frequency of all colors, returns most common (bg). Helpful for identifying fillable areas.
    n = len(g)
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for c in row:
            count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

```python
def find_runs(row: List[int], bg: int, n: int) -> List[tuple]:

        i += 1
        while i < n and row[i] == color:
            i += 1
        length = i - start
        if length >= 2:
            runs.append((start, length, color))

    # Returns (start_row, h, [run_starts], [run_colors], w) or None. Helpful but incomplete—requires all runs same w, skips if w != h, assumes single template (misses multiple types like 1's vs 4's).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 07:47:40] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 07:49:12] Response:
### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following lists only obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements that are consistent across **every** provided train example (train inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to properties like position, color, size (pixels/bbox), and holes that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in the same way in all cases. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., inconsistent color mappings, variable y-offsets/directions, or new components without clear ties) are included. Transformations that cannot be explained consistently (e.g., how y-position shifts or color changes occur) are noted as unknown. Elements without interactions (e.g., isolated small 1-pixel objects that remain unchanged without influencing others) are excluded.

#### 1. Foreground Objects ↔ Background (Holes Property)
   - **Components Involved**: All foreground objects (any non-background colored squares: Yellow, Blue, Red, Green, Maroon when not background).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Count of foreground components (each listed foreground object is one separate connected component) directly determines the background's `holes` value: `background.holes = number of foreground components`.
     - Consistent in every example: Input holes match initial component count; each new foreground component added in output increases background `holes` by exactly 1.
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Foreground components "punch" separate regions into the background, increasing its topological holes. No exceptions or variations across all trains.

#### 2. Foreground Objects ↔ Background (Pixels Property)
   - **Components Involved**: All foreground objects (any non-background colored squares) and the background (Maroon, Blue, or Green filling the large bbox).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Sum of all foreground `pixels` directly reduces the background's `pixels`: `background.pixels = total grid area - sum(foreground pixels)`.
     - Total grid area is fixed per example (e.g., 23x23=529 for bbox [0,0,22,22]; 27x27=729 for [0,0,26,26]), derived from background bbox dimensions (width = x2 - x1 + 1, height = y2 - y1 + 1).
     - Consistent in every example: Added foreground pixels in outputs exactly match the decrease in background `pixels`; initial sums match input background `pixels`.
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Foreground objects overwrite background pixels, reducing its filled area. No exceptions or variations across all trains.

#### 3. Existing Large Foreground Objects → New Large Foreground Objects (Position X-Range and Size)
   - **Components Involved**: Existing large foreground objects (those with `pixels > 1`, i.e., >1x1 squares) and newly added large foreground objects in outputs (also `pixels > 1`).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Existing large object's bbox x-range (x1 to x2) directly copies to new large object's bbox x-range (same x1 and x2 values).
     - Existing large object's size (`pixels`, bbox width, bbox height) directly copies to new large object (identical `pixels`, width = x2 - x1 + 1, height = y2 - y1 + 1; always squares).
     - Consistent in every example: All outputs add at least some new large objects that exactly match x-range and size from at least one existing large object in the input (e.g., train 1: Yellow 9px at x8-10/13-15 → new Blue 9px same x/size; train 2: Red 4px at x10-11/13-14 → new Blue 4px same x/size; train 3: Green/Yellow 4px at x11-12/16-17 → new Red/Green 4px same x/size).
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Position (x) and size properties of existing large objects propagate to new ones, indicating spatial alignment and scaling consistency. (Note: Not all new objects copy from existing; some introduce new x-ranges, but the listed interaction holds for some new objects in every example.)
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Y-range transformation (how existing y1/y2 maps to new y1/y2, including offset amount and direction) is inconsistent (varies by example, e.g., downward shift in train 1/2, upward in train 3) and cannot be explained.

#### 4. Existing Large Foreground Objects → New Large Foreground Objects (Color)
   - **Components Involved**: Existing large foreground objects (`pixels > 1`) and newly added large foreground objects in outputs (`pixels > 1`).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Existing large object's `color` influences new large object's `color` (always changes to a different color).
     - Consistent in every example: No output adds a new large object with the exact same color as its source existing large object (e.g., train 1: Yellow → Blue; train 2: Red → Blue; train 3: Green/Yellow → Red/Green).
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Color property transforms predictably in that it always changes, suggesting colors interact (e.g., one "replaces" or "evolves" into another). (Note: Some outputs introduce entirely new colors not present in large objects, e.g., Green in train 2/3, but the change from existing is consistent.)
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Specific color mapping/transformation (e.g., Yellow → Blue vs. Red → Blue vs. Green/Yellow → Red/Green) varies by example and cannot be explained consistently; background color may influence it (e.g., Maroon → favors Blue; Blue → favors Red/Green) but not uniformly across all.

#### Notes on Scope
- **No Other Consistent Interactions Identified**: 
  - Small 1-pixel objects (`pixels=1`) show no direct effects on others (they remain static and do not consistently influence positions, sizes, or colors of new objects across all examples).
  - Background color does not consistently affect foreground transformations (e.g., Maroon leads to Blue in train 1 but Blue+Green in train 2; Blue leads to Red+Green in train 3).
  - No consistent hole interactions for foreground (all have `holes=0` invariantly; no changes).
  - Positions (y) and overall arrangements (e.g., clustering, alignment) influence additions but only x-range is consistently tied as above; full positional transformations are unknown.
- **Irrelevant Elements Excluded**: Background bbox remains fixed (no interaction); pixel counts for individual objects are static once placed (no internal changes); colors like Purple mentioned in description but absent in data (no connections).

[2025-10-03 07:49:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following lists only obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements that are consistent across **every** provided train example (train inputs 1-3 and their outputs). These are limited to properties like position, color, size (pixels/bbox), and holes that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in the same way in all cases. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., inconsistent color mappings, variable y-offsets/directions, or new components without clear ties) are included. Transformations that cannot be explained consistently (e.g., how y-position shifts or color changes occur) are noted as unknown. Elements without interactions (e.g., isolated small 1-pixel objects that remain unchanged without influencing others) are excluded.

#### 1. Foreground Objects ↔ Background (Holes Property)
   - **Components Involved**: All foreground objects (any non-background colored squares: Yellow, Blue, Red, Green, Maroon when not background).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Count of foreground components (each listed foreground object is one separate connected component) directly determines the background's `holes` value: `background.holes = number of foreground components`.
     - Consistent in every example: Input holes match initial component count; each new foreground component added in output increases background `holes` by exactly 1.
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Foreground components "punch" separate regions into the background, increasing its topological holes. No exceptions or variations across all trains.

#### 2. Foreground Objects ↔ Background (Pixels Property)
   - **Components Involved**: All foreground objects (any non-background colored squares) and the background (Maroon, Blue, or Green filling the large bbox).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Sum of all foreground `pixels` directly reduces the background's `pixels`: `background.pixels = total grid area - sum(foreground pixels)`.
     - Total grid area is fixed per example (e.g., 23x23=529 for bbox [0,0,22,22]; 27x27=729 for [0,0,26,26]), derived from background bbox dimensions (width = x2 - x1 + 1, height = y2 - y1 + 1).
     - Consistent in every example: Added foreground pixels in outputs exactly match the decrease in background `pixels`; initial sums match input background `pixels`.
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Foreground objects overwrite background pixels, reducing its filled area. No exceptions or variations across all trains.

#### 3. Existing Large Foreground Objects → New Large Foreground Objects (Position X-Range and Size)
   - **Components Involved**: Existing large foreground objects (those with `pixels > 1`, i.e., >1x1 squares) and newly added large foreground objects in outputs (also `pixels > 1`).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Existing large object's bbox x-range (x1 to x2) directly copies to new large object's bbox x-range (same x1 and x2 values).
     - Existing large object's size (`pixels`, bbox width, bbox height) directly copies to new large object (identical `pixels`, width = x2 - x1 + 1, height = y2 - y1 + 1; always squares).
     - Consistent in every example: All outputs add at least some new large objects that exactly match x-range and size from at least one existing large object in the input (e.g., train 1: Yellow 9px at x8-10/13-15 → new Blue 9px same x/size; train 2: Red 4px at x10-11/13-14 → new Blue 4px same x/size; train 3: Green/Yellow 4px at x11-12/16-17 → new Red/Green 4px same x/size).
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Position (x) and size properties of existing large objects propagate to new ones, indicating spatial alignment and scaling consistency. (Note: Not all new objects copy from existing; some introduce new x-ranges, but the listed interaction holds for some new objects in every example.)
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Y-range transformation (how existing y1/y2 maps to new y1/y2, including offset amount and direction) is inconsistent (varies by example, e.g., downward shift in train 1/2, upward in train 3) and cannot be explained.

#### 4. Existing Large Foreground Objects → New Large Foreground Objects (Color)
   - **Components Involved**: Existing large foreground objects (`pixels > 1`) and newly added large foreground objects in outputs (`pixels > 1`).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Existing large object's `color` influences new large object's `color` (always changes to a different color).
     - Consistent in every example: No output adds a new large object with the exact same color as its source existing large object (e.g., train 1: Yellow → Blue; train 2: Red → Blue; train 3: Green/Yellow → Red/Green).
   - **Evidence of Interaction**: Color property transforms predictably in that it always changes, suggesting colors interact (e.g., one "replaces" or "evolves" into another). (Note: Some outputs introduce entirely new colors not present in large objects, e.g., Green in train 2/3, but the change from existing is consistent.)
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Specific color mapping/transformation (e.g., Yellow → Blue vs. Red → Blue vs. Green/Yellow → Red/Green) varies by example and cannot be explained consistently; background color may influence it (e.g., Maroon → favors Blue; Blue → favors Red/Green) but not uniformly across all.

#### Notes on Scope
- **No Other Consistent Interactions Identified**: 
  - Small 1-pixel objects (`pixels=1`) show no direct effects on others (they remain static and do not consistently influence positions, sizes, or colors of new objects across all examples).
  - Background color does not consistently affect foreground transformations (e.g., Maroon leads to Blue in train 1 but Blue+Green in train 2; Blue leads to Red+Green in train 3).
  - No consistent hole interactions for foreground (all have `holes=0` invariantly; no changes).
  - Positions (y) and overall arrangements (e.g., clustering, alignment) influence additions but only x-range is consistently tied as above; full positional transformations are unknown.
- **Irrelevant Elements Excluded**: Background bbox remains fixed (no interaction); pixel counts for individual objects are static once placed (no internal changes); colors like Purple mentioned in description but absent in data (no connections).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:02:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg via frequency.)

```python
def find_min_fg(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> int:
    candidates = [c for row in g for c in row if c != bg]
    return min(candidates) if candidates else bg
```
(Helpful: Gets lowest foreground color for default additions.)

```python
def find_large_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]]:
    # (Full flood-fill based detection of filled rectangular components >1 cell)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'y1', 'y2', 'x1', 'x2', 'color', 'h', 'w'
```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

```python
def has_special(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int, blocks: tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]], y1: int, h: int, large_color: int, min_fg: int) -> tp.Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if not blocks:
        return False, 0
    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step
        if p1 >= 0:
            added.append(p1)
            p2 = y1 - 2 * step
            if p2 >= 0:
                added.append(p2)
    return added
```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

```python
def add_rectangle(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], py: int, x1: int, x2: int, color: int, h: int, n: int):
    for i in range(h):
        yy = py + i
        if 0 <= yy < n:
            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 08:03:58] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** training inputs/outputs (and observable in the test input where applicable). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case, without speculation or forcing unrelated patterns. Only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included—irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific asymmetric placements without consistent effects, or colors without cross-example ties) are excluded. Transformations (e.g., exact y-position shifts or color selection rules for new tiles) that cannot be explained as simple, consistent interactions are noted as unknown rather than elaborated.

#### 1. **Background Holes ↔ Total Number of Tile Components**
   - **Description**: The background's `holes` property is directly tied to the total count of tile components (each distinct bbox in the tile list counts as 1 component, regardless of its size or color). Adding new tile components increases the background `holes` by exactly the number of new components added.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: 8 tiles → holes=8; Output adds 4 tiles → holes=12.
     - Train Input 2: 12 tiles → holes=12; Output adds 8 tiles → holes=20.
     - Train Input 3: 8 tiles → holes=8; Output adds 4 tiles → holes=12.
     - Test Input 1: 12 tiles → holes=12 (no output, but matches pattern).
   - **Interaction Type**: Additive (tiles "punch" holes in background); consistent count-based effect.
   - **Unknowns**: No explanation for why specific numbers of tiles are added in each case.

#### 2. **Background Pixels ↔ Sum of All Tiles' Pixels**
   - **Description**: The background's `pixels` property decreases by exactly the total `pixels` value of all newly added tiles (sum across their individual `pixels`). Existing tiles' pixels do not change this relationship.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: bg pixels=505; Output adds tiles totaling 36 pixels → bg pixels=469 (decrease of 36).
     - Train Input 2: bg pixels=511; Output adds tiles totaling 32 pixels → bg pixels=479 (decrease of 32).
     - Train Input 3: bg pixels=515; Output adds tiles totaling 16 pixels → bg pixels=499 (decrease of 16).
     - Test Input 1: No output, but existing tiles' total pixels (3*1 + 2*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 40) aligns with bg pixels=687 implying a fixed total area (interaction preserved in structure).
   - **Interaction Type**: Subtractive (tiles "occupy" pixels from background); consistent pixel-based effect.
   - **Unknowns**: Exact total canvas area varies slightly or is not fixed (e.g., 22x22 vs. 26x26 bboxes), but the delta is always exact.

#### 3. **Existing Tiles' Positions, Colors, Sizes, and Holes ↔ Preservation in Output**
   - **Description**: All properties of input tiles (bbox positions, colors, `pixels` sizes, `holes=0`) remain completely unchanged in the output. No existing tiles are modified, moved, resized, or recolored.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: All 8 input tiles (e.g., small yellows at [1,1,1,1] and [3,1,3,1], large yellows at [8,1,10,3], etc.) identical in output.
     - Train Input 2: All 12 input tiles (e.g., small reds at [1,1,1,1], large reds at [10,4,11,5]) identical in output.
     - Train Input 3: All 8 input tiles (e.g., small red at [1,1,1,1], large green at [11,20,12,21]) identical in output, including retention of bottom-placed larges.
     - Test Input 1: No output, but structure (e.g., small blues at row 1, large yellow at [13,10,16,13]) sets up for preservation.
   - **Interaction Type**: Static preservation (existing tiles do not interact with or affect transformations); ensures continuity.
   - **Unknowns**: None—this is fully consistent and direct.

#### 4. **New Tiles' Colors ↔ Existing Tiles' Colors**
   - **Description**: All newly added tiles in outputs use colors that already exist among the input tiles (no entirely new colors introduced). The background color does not influence new tile colors.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: Input has yellow/blue; adds only blue tiles.
     - Train Input 2: Input has red/blue/green; adds only blue/green tiles.
     - Train Input 3: Input has red/green/yellow (bg blue, but not used for tiles); adds only red/green tiles.
     - Test Input 1: No output, but has blue/yellow/red/maroon/green (bg green), setting up for reuse.
   - **Interaction Type**: Reuse/selection (new tiles draw from input color set); limits palette expansion.
   - **Unknowns**: Exact rule for which existing color(s) are selected for new tiles (e.g., why blue in Train 1/2 but not Train 3) is unknown.

#### 5. **New Tiles' Sizes (`pixels`) ↔ Existing Large Tiles' Sizes**
   - **Description**: All newly added tiles have a `pixels` value that matches the `pixels` of existing large tiles (>1 pixel) in the input. Small tiles (1 pixel) are never added as new components in outputs.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: Existing large=9 pixels; all 4 new tiles=9 pixels each.
     - Train Input 2: Existing large=4 pixels; all 8 new tiles=4 pixels each.
     - Train Input 3: Existing large=4 pixels; all 4 new tiles=4 pixels each.
     - Test Input 1: No output, but existing large=16 pixels, implying potential match for additions.
   - **Interaction Type**: Size matching (new tiles copy scale from input larges); ensures uniformity in block sizes.
   - **Unknowns**: Why small (1-pixel) tiles are never added as new (top patterns stay static); no interaction with background color or holes here.

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No Consistent Position-Based Interactions**: While new tiles often share x-bbox ranges with existing large tiles (e.g., same column spans in Train 1/3), this is not universal—Train 2 introduces new x-ranges (e.g., x16-17) not present in input larges. Y-positions consistently shift to higher values (downward in visual terms), but the exact transformation (e.g., offsets or spacing) varies and cannot be explained consistently without solving.
- **No Consistent Color-to-Position or Size-to-Color Interactions**: Properties like color do not reliably affect positions, sizes, or holes across all examples (e.g., yellow larges in Train 1 lead to blue additions at specific x, but green in Train 3 leads to red/green without matching pattern).
- **Irrelevant/Excluded Elements**: Background bbox remains fixed but has no interactive effect. Small (1-pixel) tiles interact only via preservation and count (for holes). No consistent role for `holes=0` in tiles beyond uniformity. Semantic shapes (e.g., clusters) or visual contrasts do not show cross-example effects on transformations.
- **Overall Components Involved**: Primary interconnected set is {tiles (color, bbox/position, pixels/size, holes=0) ↔ background (color, holes, pixels, bbox)}. No other components (e.g., isolated colors like maroon-as-tile in test) show consistent ties.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 08:03:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** training inputs/outputs (and observable in the test input where applicable). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case, without speculation or forcing unrelated patterns. Only elements with clear, repeated interactions are included—irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific asymmetric placements without consistent effects, or colors without cross-example ties) are excluded. Transformations (e.g., exact y-position shifts or color selection rules for new tiles) that cannot be explained as simple, consistent interactions are noted as unknown rather than elaborated.

#### 1. **Background Holes ↔ Total Number of Tile Components**
   - **Description**: The background's `holes` property is directly tied to the total count of tile components (each distinct bbox in the tile list counts as 1 component, regardless of its size or color). Adding new tile components increases the background `holes` by exactly the number of new components added.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: 8 tiles → holes=8; Output adds 4 tiles → holes=12.
     - Train Input 2: 12 tiles → holes=12; Output adds 8 tiles → holes=20.
     - Train Input 3: 8 tiles → holes=8; Output adds 4 tiles → holes=12.
     - Test Input 1: 12 tiles → holes=12 (no output, but matches pattern).
   - **Interaction Type**: Additive (tiles "punch" holes in background); consistent count-based effect.
   - **Unknowns**: No explanation for why specific numbers of tiles are added in each case.

#### 2. **Background Pixels ↔ Sum of All Tiles' Pixels**
   - **Description**: The background's `pixels` property decreases by exactly the total `pixels` value of all newly added tiles (sum across their individual `pixels`). Existing tiles' pixels do not change this relationship.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: bg pixels=505; Output adds tiles totaling 36 pixels → bg pixels=469 (decrease of 36).
     - Train Input 2: bg pixels=511; Output adds tiles totaling 32 pixels → bg pixels=479 (decrease of 32).
     - Train Input 3: bg pixels=515; Output adds tiles totaling 16 pixels → bg pixels=499 (decrease of 16).
     - Test Input 1: No output, but existing tiles' total pixels (3*1 + 2*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 16 + 16 + 1 = 40) aligns with bg pixels=687 implying a fixed total area (interaction preserved in structure).
   - **Interaction Type**: Subtractive (tiles "occupy" pixels from background); consistent pixel-based effect.
   - **Unknowns**: Exact total canvas area varies slightly or is not fixed (e.g., 22x22 vs. 26x26 bboxes), but the delta is always exact.

#### 3. **Existing Tiles' Positions, Colors, Sizes, and Holes ↔ Preservation in Output**
   - **Description**: All properties of input tiles (bbox positions, colors, `pixels` sizes, `holes=0`) remain completely unchanged in the output. No existing tiles are modified, moved, resized, or recolored.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: All 8 input tiles (e.g., small yellows at [1,1,1,1] and [3,1,3,1], large yellows at [8,1,10,3], etc.) identical in output.
     - Train Input 2: All 12 input tiles (e.g., small reds at [1,1,1,1], large reds at [10,4,11,5]) identical in output.
     - Train Input 3: All 8 input tiles (e.g., small red at [1,1,1,1], large green at [11,20,12,21]) identical in output, including retention of bottom-placed larges.
     - Test Input 1: No output, but structure (e.g., small blues at row 1, large yellow at [13,10,16,13]) sets up for preservation.
   - **Interaction Type**: Static preservation (existing tiles do not interact with or affect transformations); ensures continuity.
   - **Unknowns**: None—this is fully consistent and direct.

#### 4. **New Tiles' Colors ↔ Existing Tiles' Colors**
   - **Description**: All newly added tiles in outputs use colors that already exist among the input tiles (no entirely new colors introduced). The background color does not influence new tile colors.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: Input has yellow/blue; adds only blue tiles.
     - Train Input 2: Input has red/blue/green; adds only blue/green tiles.
     - Train Input 3: Input has red/green/yellow (bg blue, but not used for tiles); adds only red/green tiles.
     - Test Input 1: No output, but has blue/yellow/red/maroon/green (bg green), setting up for reuse.
   - **Interaction Type**: Reuse/selection (new tiles draw from input color set); limits palette expansion.
   - **Unknowns**: Exact rule for which existing color(s) are selected for new tiles (e.g., why blue in Train 1/2 but not Train 3) is unknown.

#### 5. **New Tiles' Sizes (`pixels`) ↔ Existing Large Tiles' Sizes**
   - **Description**: All newly added tiles have a `pixels` value that matches the `pixels` of existing large tiles (>1 pixel) in the input. Small tiles (1 pixel) are never added as new components in outputs.
   - **Consistency Across Examples**:
     - Train Input 1: Existing large=9 pixels; all 4 new tiles=9 pixels each.
     - Train Input 2: Existing large=4 pixels; all 8 new tiles=4 pixels each.
     - Train Input 3: Existing large=4 pixels; all 4 new tiles=4 pixels each.
     - Test Input 1: No output, but existing large=16 pixels, implying potential match for additions.
   - **Interaction Type**: Size matching (new tiles copy scale from input larges); ensures uniformity in block sizes.
   - **Unknowns**: Why small (1-pixel) tiles are never added as new (top patterns stay static); no interaction with background color or holes here.

#### Additional Notes on Scope
- **No Consistent Position-Based Interactions**: While new tiles often share x-bbox ranges with existing large tiles (e.g., same column spans in Train 1/3), this is not universal—Train 2 introduces new x-ranges (e.g., x16-17) not present in input larges. Y-positions consistently shift to higher values (downward in visual terms), but the exact transformation (e.g., offsets or spacing) varies and cannot be explained consistently without solving.
- **No Consistent Color-to-Position or Size-to-Color Interactions**: Properties like color do not reliably affect positions, sizes, or holes across all examples (e.g., yellow larges in Train 1 lead to blue additions at specific x, but green in Train 3 leads to red/green without matching pattern).
- **Irrelevant/Excluded Elements**: Background bbox remains fixed but has no interactive effect. Small (1-pixel) tiles interact only via preservation and count (for holes). No consistent role for `holes=0` in tiles beyond uniformity. Semantic shapes (e.g., clusters) or visual contrasts do not show cross-example effects on transformations.
- **Overall Components Involved**: Primary interconnected set is {tiles (color, bbox/position, pixels/size, holes=0) ↔ background (color, holes, pixels, bbox)}. No other components (e.g., isolated colors like maroon-as-tile in test) show consistent ties.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:21:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block placement where "small rows" (sparse patterned rows at specific odd indices like 1,3,5,7) serve as control instructions to replicate or extend "large layers" (dense block structures starting around row 8 or similar) into additional stacked or mirrored layers across the grid, using the background color (bg, e.g., 8, 1, or 3) to identify empty space and ensuring layers fit within grid bounds without overwriting existing content unless it's bg.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) varies per example (8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test) and must be dynamically detected (e.g., from g[0][0]); all non-bg cells are potential blocks or instructions.
 * Small rows are candidates at fixed odd indices (1,3,5,7) but only qualify if positions 1 and/or 3 are non-bg; these rows provide color cues for new layers (e.g., g[sr][1] as first color, g[sr][3] as second, g[sr][5] optionally as third if non-bg).
 * Large layers are identified in lower/middle grid sections (e.g., starting at min row with non-bg in cols 8+), consisting of horizontal blocks defined by start col, width, and color; spacing between blocks (e.g., from first to second block) must be preserved for alignment in new layers.
 * Layer placement logic depends on large layer position: if top-half (is_top = large_start < n//2), stack downward with spacing like 2*h or 2*h-1 (h=height of large layer); if bottom-half, stack upward with fixed d=2*h+1; always clip to [0, n-h] to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * New layers (for k=1 to t-1, where t=len(small_rows)) copy the large layer's structure (start cols, widths) but use small row colors; optionally add an extra block if has_col5 (g[sr][5] non-bg) at position after last block + spacing, with width assumed square (w=h).
 * Only overwrite bg cells in new layers to avoid corrupting existing content; if no small rows or no large blocks, output unchanged grid.
 * Subtle: Number of blocks p in large layer limits colors from small row (e.g., only use first p colors); assume square blocks if no widths (w=h); handle variable grid sizes (23x23 in trains, ~27x27 in test); potential for 0-4 small rows, leading to 0-3 added layers.
 * Easy to miss: Large layer height h is max-min row span of non-bg in cols 8+ (not full grid height); blocks in large layer skip bg cols; downward stacking may use varying deltas (e.g., 2h for full, 2h-1 for partial); extra block only if p>=1 and col5 non-bg; test has more cols (27), so large layer blocks extend further right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is reliable for non-destructive modification.)

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Accurately detects varying bg like 8,1,3 from top-left.)

```python
def get_small_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    candidates = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    n = len(g)
    return [r for r in candidates if r < n and g[r][1] != bg and g[r][3] != bg]
```
(Helpful for identifying control rows, but note it requires both col1 and col3 non-bg—may miss rows with only one; in train3, it would catch rows 1,3,5 with patterns like 2/3,3/3,3/4.)

```python
def has_col5(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, r: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    return 0 <= r < n and g[r][5] != bg
```
(Useful for detecting optional third block in small rows, e.g., triggers extra in train2 row5 with 3 at col5.)

```python
def find_large_layer(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, 0, []
    m = len(g[0])
    large_rs = [r for r in range(n) if any(c != bg for c in g[r][8:m])]
    if not large_rs:
        return 0, 0, []
    start_r = min(large_rs)
    h = max(large_rs) - start_r + 1
    blocks = []
    i = 8
    while i < m:
        if g[start_r][i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        colr = g[start_r][i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < m and g[start_r][j] == colr:
            j += 1
        w = j - i
        blocks.append((i, w, colr))
        i = j
    return start_r, h, blocks
```
(This correctly extracts the large layer's start row, height, and block list (start_col, width, color) from cols 8+ in the first non-empty row of the span; helpful for base structure, but assumes blocks only in start_r—may miss vertical variations; works for train1's 4-blocks at cols~8-16.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core placement logic is flawed despite detecting bg, small rows, and large layers.
 * Train1: Generated correctly placed initial small rows (1-3: left 4/1 patterns, middle 4's) and detected large layer (1's at rows7-9, cols8-16), but misplaced added layers—e.g., left 1's appear in row5 (unexpected, overwrites empty) instead of row5 empty/row6 middle 1's; bottom 1's duplicated at rows12-14 but shifted up one row from expected rows12-14 (expected has gap at row10-11); no extra block added, but p=2 so only two colors used correctly; unknown why left patterns in row5 but not aligned to expected.
 * Train2: Generated detected small rows (1:2/2? but shown as 2/2 wait, input not shown but output has row1:2's left, row3:1's left, row5:2's middle +3 left?); large layer partially captured (1's at rows8-9 cols10-16? but misplaced); added layers wrong—e.g., row7 has 1's left +3 but expected row7:1's left +1's middle no 3; row12-13 has 1's middle +3's right but expected row11-12:1's middle +3's right; extra 3's appear in row5/7/13/15 but expected only in specific spots like row5 col5, row11-12 cols16-17, row14-15 cols16-17; row4 has unexpected 2's middle; seems extra blocks added too often or wrong colors/spacing.
 * Train3: Bg=1 detected; small rows at 1(2/3),3(3/3),5(3/4); no large layer detected (since cols8+ all bg=1, so blocks=[] returns early, no additions); generated unchanged from input? But output shows left patterns in rows1,3,5,6? and bottom layers at rows15-17(3's),21-22(3/4) but expected has middle layers at rows10-11(2/3),15-17(3's),21-22(3/4); generated misses middle 2/3 entirely and places 3/4 too early/wrong; also row15-17 has 3's but shifted left/no 4's integrated; function find_large_layer broken here as no cols8+ non-bg, so skips all additions—unhelpful for cases without right-side large layer.
 * Overall: Layer stacking deltas wrong (e.g., is_top logic places downward but with incorrect 2h vs 2h-1, leading to overlaps/shifts); clipping helps but doesn't fix miscalculations; color assignment uses small row correctly but p limits it (good); extra block via has_col5 triggers but positioning (last + spacing) misaligns; w=h assumption okay but untested; program doesn't handle no-large-layer (just returns copy, but train3 needs additions? Wait, train3 expected has added bottom layers despite no large—major flaw).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it replicates some left small-row patterns (e.g., row1:1's at col1/3, row3:4's col1/3 +2 col5, row5:1/4/1 left, row6:1/4 left) and detects a large layer around rows10-13 (4's cols13-16, 2's cols18-21) and adds bottom layers at rows18-21 (4's +4's? +2's but colors wrong, expected likely 4's then 1's or per small), rows23-26 (1's cols13-16 +4's cols18-21 +1's cols24-27); but placements are shifted—e.g., row7 has unexpected 8 at col1 (bg=3, but 8!=3, possible overwrite error); row18-21 has 4's/2's but expected probably mirrored or color-swapped per small rows (e.g., using colors from row1/3/5 like 1,4,2); extra blocks added (e.g., row18-21 has extra 4's cols18-21 then 2's, but misaligned spacing); bottom rows23-26 have 1's/4's/1's but likely wrong colors (small row5 has 1/4/1? but p=2 for large? so extra via col5?); overall, similar to trains: left patterns kept but added layers misplaced vertically (gaps wrong, e.g., row14-17 all bg but expected may have more stacking), and right blocks not fully extended (27 cols suggest more blocks possible); doesn't match because training logic fails analogously—no large in trains3 but test has one, yet stacking buggy.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 08:21:12] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements across **all** train input/output pairs (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every example, based on the provided data (e.g., colors, positions, sizes, holes, pixels). I have excluded anything inconsistent (e.g., variable y-spacing rules for additions, which differ between train 2's tight spacing and train 3's wider spacing, so marked as unknown), irrelevant (e.g., asymmetrical empty spaces not affecting changes), or non-interactive (e.g., isolated small components without demonstrated effects). No high-level puzzle solution or transformation explanation is attempted or implied—only direct, verifiable links. Where a connection exists but its mechanism is not explainable from the data, it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Foreground Components ↔ Background (Holes Property)**
   - Each foreground component (any colored rectangle, small or large) consistently increases the background's `holes` count by exactly 1.
   - Total `holes` in background = exact count of all foreground components in the image.
   - Consistent effect: Foreground presence directly "punches" one hole per component into the background, regardless of size, color, or position.
   - Seen in: All train inputs (e.g., train 1 input: 8 fg → 8 holes; train 2 input: 12 fg → 12 holes) and outputs (e.g., train 1 output: 12 fg → 12 holes, after adding 4 fg).

#### 2. **Foreground Components ↔ Background (Pixels Property)**
   - Sum of all foreground `pixels` consistently reduces the background's `pixels` by exactly that total amount.
   - Background `pixels` = total grid pixels (inferred as (max bbox coord + 1)^2, e.g., 23x23=529 for bbox max=22) minus sum of all foreground `pixels`.
   - Consistent effect: Foreground area directly subtracts from background fill, assuming a fixed grid size per image (no overlaps between fg components).
   - Seen in: All train inputs (e.g., train 1 input: fg total 24 pixels → bg 505 = 529-24) and outputs (e.g., train 1 output: fg total 60 pixels → bg 469 = 529-60, after adding 36 fg pixels).

#### 3. **Small 1-Pixel Foreground Components (Low y, Low x) → Preservation in Output**
   - All 1-pixel (1x1 bbox, `pixels=1`) foreground components located at low y-coordinates (y ≤7) and low x-coordinates (x ≤5) remain completely unchanged (same color, exact bbox position, size, `pixels=1`, `holes=0`).
   - Consistent effect: These specific components have no transformation or movement; they are static and do not affect other elements (e.g., no color propagation or position shift observed).
   - Interaction limit: They do not interact with larger components or background beyond the general fg ↔ bg rules above.
   - Seen in: All train pairs (e.g., train 1: yellow at [1,1] and [3,1], blues at [1,3]/[3,3]/[1,5]/[3,5] identical in input/output; train 2: reds/blues/greens at y1/3/5/7 x1/3/5 identical; train 3: red/green/yellow at y1/3/5 x1/3 identical).

#### 4. **Larger Foreground Components (>1 Pixel) → Preservation and Addition in Output**
   - All larger (>1 `pixels`) foreground components in input are preserved unchanged (same color, bbox position, size, `pixels`, `holes=0`) in output.
   - Outputs consistently add new larger components with:
     - Exact same dimensions (width = x2-x1+1, height = y2-y1+1, thus same `pixels`) as the input's larger components.
     - Same x-range(s) (bbox x1-x2) as the input's larger components (e.g., matching columns).
   - Consistent effect: Input larger components "seed" identical-sized duplicates in x-aligned positions; added components interact with background via holes/pixels rules (each adds 1 hole, subtracts its pixels).
   - Unknown: Exact y-positioning rule for additions (e.g., below in train 1/2, above in train 3; spacing varies: +3/+5 in train 1/3 vs. +2/+3 in train 2—cannot explain consistently).
   - Seen in: All train pairs (e.g., train 1: input 9px/3x3 yellows at x8-10/13-15 y1-3 preserved, adds 4 new 9px/3x3 at same x; train 2: input 4px/2x2 reds at x10-11/13-14 y4-5 preserved, adds 8 new 4px/2x2 at same x; train 3: input 4px/2x2 green/yellow at x11-12/16-17 y20-21 preserved, adds 4 new 4px/2x2 at same x).

#### 5. **Larger Foreground Components (Color Property) → Added Components (Color Property)**
   - Colors of added larger components are always from the set of colors present in the small 1-pixel components of the same image (e.g., yellow/blue in train 1; red/blue/green in train 2/3).
   - Consistent effect: Input larger component colors do not directly propagate (added colors often differ, e.g., yellow input → blue added in train 1), but added colors are constrained to the small components' color palette—no new colors introduced.
   - Unknown: Specific color assignment rule for additions (e.g., why blue in train 1 vs. red/green in train 3—varies and not explainable consistently; purple mentioned in description but absent in train data, so no connection identifiable).
   - Seen in: All train pairs (e.g., train 1 small colors: yellow/blue → added blues only; train 2 small: red/blue/green → added blue/green only; train 3 small: red/green/yellow → added red/green only).

#### 6. **All Foreground Components (General Properties)**
   - All foreground components (small or large) consistently have `holes=0` (solid, no internal gaps) and uniform color fill within their bbox.
   - No consistent interaction with edges/silhouettes/movement beyond position preservation for small ones and x-aligned addition for large ones (e.g., no observed effects from bbox edges on transformations).
   - Background color remains unchanged (e.g., maroon in train 1/2, blue in train 3), with no interaction to fg colors or positions.

No other consistent interactions identifiable (e.g., no reliable position → color links across all, as y-effects on color vary; no hole count or pixel count effects beyond bg; no purple interactions in train data). Test input follows the same fg ↔ bg rules (12 fg → 12 holes; fg 42 pixels → bg 687 on 27x27=729 grid) but no output provided for verification.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 08:23:32] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists of integers representing visual elements like shapes, objects, or patterns), where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes training examples and a test input to produce correct outputs, possibly extracting or classifying objects based on puzzle rules. The previous attempt failed entirely due to a structural issue in the generated code, preventing any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function, as its absence causes immediate validation errors across all examples; this is a core structural requirement, not related to puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid patterns for objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, or connected components), with rules for extraction, counting features like holes or connections, and matching against expected outputs—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or incomplete spans across the grid.
 * Training examples are provided to infer rules (e.g., what constitutes a valid object or transformation), and the test input must be processed similarly without overfitting; subtle elements include omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching criteria like hole count) and ensuring outputs exactly match expected formats.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle logic was tested due to errors, but future attempts should include functions for grid parsing (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) and validation against training data; watch for mismatches in blob shapes, object omission, or grid boundaries that could alter connectivity.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must be deterministic and exact (no approximations); grids may have noise or separators that need filtering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function and any puzzle-specific logic. Future attempts should include grid-processing utilities like those below for object extraction.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful type for puzzle elements (not from previous attempt)
class PuzzleObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but recommended for future use)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[PuzzleObject]:
    # Use flood-fill or DFS to find connected components/objects in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []  # Collect positions
                # Implement DFS or BFS here to trace connected cells
                # Count holes if needed (e.g., enclosed zeros)
                hole_count = 0  # Placeholder: implement hole detection
                objects.append(PuzzleObject(component, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated code completely omitted the required 'program' function, leading to errors in all training examples and the test input—no puzzle logic was executed or evaluated.
 * No object extraction or grid processing was possible, so issues like blob shape mismatches, object omission (e.g., based on hole count or validity), or handling dividers/separators could not be assessed.
 * No helpful functions were provided; any future code without 'program' is structurally broken and irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * Training examples 1-3 all failed identically due to the missing function, indicating a total lack of adherence to code format requirements—subtle puzzle rules (e.g., connectivity in grids) remain untested.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the puzzle, as even basic validation failed for unknown reasons related to code generation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates invalid code rather than a puzzle solution (e.g., no processed grid output, object list, or classification).
 * It is different from expected because a valid test output should apply inferred puzzle rules to the test grid (e.g., extracting and describing objects like shapes with holes), but nothing was generated—likely missing key elements like object positions, counts, or matches to training patterns.
 * This error prevents checking if the test handles subtleties like unique grid configurations (e.g., non-spanning keys or irregular objects), confirming the output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 likely as a special case or background) where the goal is to detect and extend patterns of horizontal blocks and vertical "tracks" (likely signal columns) to place additional colored blocks in empty spaces, following rules for anchoring, gaps, and subsequence matching to complete a symmetric or patterned output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) must be correctly identified as the uniform row color or default to top-left; it's crucial for distinguishing signals and blocks from empty space, but the code mishandles cases where bg is 0.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (odd indices) with exactly one non-bg cell per column to qualify as signals; multiple consecutive non-bg cells disqualify them, enforcing isolated signal points.
 * Signal rows are those containing any non-bg cell in a track; colors in these rows (per track) form sequences that must match block color patterns via subsequence checking.
 * Horizontal blocks are consecutive non-bg cells of the same color in rows, but only those of length >=2 are considered; all blocks must have consistent height h (vertical span), or the puzzle fails validation.
 * Anchoring involves sliding a window of height h over rows to find where existing blocks' colors form a subsequence matching one signal color sequence; this anchors the pattern for extensions.
 * Placement extends blocks forward/backward from the anchor using steps (df=2h-1 forward, db=2h+1 backward), with fixed gaps between blocks; new blocks are placed only in bg cells, but overplacement or out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Subtleties: Assumes consistent h across blocks (inconsistent leads to no-op return); subsequence matching is loose (allows extra elements in signal); gaps are fixed from initial blocks; odd-column bias for tracks may miss even-column signals; 0/bg confusion in validation (e.g., "cell == 0 or cell == g[0][0] and g[0][0] == 0" is buggy); no rotation or vertical blocks considered; assumes square grid.
 * Edge cases: No tracks/signals/blocks result in unchanged grid; extension stops at grid edges; multiple signals per row/track not handled beyond collection; colors must be uniform per block vertically/horizontally.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for isolation.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):  # Odd columns only
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                if consec > max_consec:
                    max_consec = consec
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts signal tracks with isolated non-bg cells; helpful but assumes odd columns and single-cell isolation.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                signal_set.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))

def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(These collect signal positions and per-row color sequences from tracks; essential for pattern matching, but assumes one color per track per row.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(This finds horizontal block spans of same color >=2 wide; useful for detecting existing patterns, but collects across all rows without vertical consistency check.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence checker; key for matching block colors to signals, allows non-contiguous matches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt failed completely due to syntax errors (invalid code like stray "wait no..." comment in find_anchor at line ~88), preventing any execution or output generation.
 * What worked: Basic structure for extracting bg, tracks, signals, and blocks is logically sound and puzzle-aligned; subsequence matching and gap calculation capture core pattern extension ideas.
 * What didn't work: Syntax errors caused total failure (no outputs generated); find_anchor has incomplete/broken validation logic (e.g., unfinished bg checks, assumes uniform h without enforcement); placement logic (extend_ranges_for_placement, place_at) is overly rigid (fixed steps df/db, gap-based extension) and doesn't handle variable gaps, rotations, or non-odd tracks; no handling for multiple anchors or failed matches beyond no-op; assumes all blocks same height h, which may not hold; ignores even columns for tracks, potentially missing signals.
 * anchor finding (find_anchor) is broken/not helpful due to syntax and vague validation (e.g., skips bg cells incorrectly, doesn't enforce vertical uniformity properly); don't use in future without fixes.
 * get_gap and extend_ranges_for_placement are partially helpful for spacing but assume fixed gaps and forward-only extension, which may not fit puzzle symmetries.
 * Overall, the attempt shows partial understanding of signal/block detection but fails on integration and execution; training examples all errored identically, indicating no progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error due to syntax, so no grid is generated; this does not make sense or match any expected puzzle completion, as the program doesn't run to produce a modified grid.
 * Without valid execution, cannot verify if placements align with test input's patterns (e.g., expected block extensions or signal matches); the error prevents any comparison, confirming the output is incorrect and unhelpful.
 * To handle test cases, future attempts must fix syntax, add robust error handling for inconsistent h/gaps, and validate against expected symmetric placements (e.g., mirroring signals around anchor).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[tuple]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block placement where "small rows" (sparse patterned rows at specific odd indices like 1,3,5,7) serve as control instructions to replicate or extend "large layers" (dense block structures starting around row 8 or similar) into additional stacked or mirrored layers across the grid, using the background color (bg, e.g., 8, 1, or 3) to identify empty space and ensuring layers fit within grid bounds without overwriting existing content unless it's bg.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) varies per example (8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test) and must be dynamically detected (e.g., from g[0][0]); all non-bg cells are potential blocks or instructions.
 * Small rows are candidates at fixed odd indices (1,3,5,7) but only qualify if positions 1 and/or 3 are non-bg; these rows provide color cues for new layers (e.g., g[sr][1] as first color, g[sr][3] as second, g[sr][5] optionally as third if non-bg).
 * Large layers are identified in lower/middle grid sections (e.g., starting at min row with non-bg in cols 8+), consisting of horizontal blocks defined by start col, width, and color; spacing between blocks (e.g., from first to second block) must be preserved for alignment in new layers.
 * Layer placement logic depends on large layer position: if top-half (is_top = large_start < n//2), stack downward with spacing like 2*h or 2*h-1 (h=height of large layer); if bottom-half, stack upward with fixed d=2*h+1; always clip to [0, n-h] to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * New layers (for k=1 to t-1, where t=len(small_rows)) copy the large layer's structure (start cols, widths) but use small row colors; optionally add an extra block if has_col5 (g[sr][5] non-bg) at position after last block + spacing, with width assumed square (w=h).
 * Only overwrite bg cells in new layers to avoid corrupting existing content; if no small rows or no large blocks, output unchanged grid.
 * Subtle: Number of blocks p in large layer limits colors from small row (e.g., only use first p colors); assume square blocks if no widths (w=h); handle variable grid sizes (23x23 in trains, ~27x27 in test); potential for 0-4 small rows, leading to 0-3 added layers.
 * Easy to miss: Large layer height h is max-min row span of non-bg in cols 8+ (not full grid height); blocks in large layer skip bg cols; downward stacking may use varying deltas (e.g., 2h for full, 2h-1 for partial); extra block only if p>=1 and col5 non-bg; test has more cols (27), so large layer blocks extend further right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is reliable for non-destructive modification.)

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Accurately detects varying bg like 8,1,3 from top-left.)

```python
def get_small_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    candidates = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    n = len(g)
    return [r for r in candidates if r < n and g[r][1] != bg and g[r][3] != bg]
```
(Helpful for identifying control rows, but note it requires both col1 and col3 non-bg—may miss rows with only one; in train3, it would catch rows 1,3,5 with patterns like 2/3,3/3,3/4.)

```python
def has_col5(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, r: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    return 0 <= r < n and g[r][5] != bg
```
(Useful for detecting optional third block in small rows, e.g., triggers extra in train2 row5 with 3 at col5.)

```python
def find_large_layer(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, 0, []
    m = len(g[0])
    large_rs = [r for r in range(n) if any(c != bg for c in g[r][8:m])]
    if not large_rs:
        return 0, 0, []
    start_r = min(large_rs)
    h = max(large_rs) - start_r + 1
    blocks = []
    i = 8
    while i < m:
        if g[start_r][i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        colr = g[start_r][i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < m and g[start_r][j] == colr:
            j += 1
        w = j - i
        blocks.append((i, w, colr))
        i = j
    return start_r, h, blocks
```
(This correctly extracts the large layer's start row, height, and block list (start_col, width, color) from cols 8+ in the first non-empty row of the span; helpful for base structure, but assumes blocks only in start_r—may miss vertical variations; works for train1's 4-blocks at cols~8-16.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core placement logic is flawed despite detecting bg, small rows, and large layers.
 * Train1: Generated correctly placed initial small rows (1-3: left 4/1 patterns, middle 4's) and detected large layer (1's at rows7-9, cols8-16), but misplaced added layers—e.g., left 1's appear in row5 (unexpected, overwrites empty) instead of row5 empty/row6 middle 1's; bottom 1's duplicated at rows12-14 but shifted up one row from expected rows12-14 (expected has gap at row10-11); no extra block added, but p=2 so only two colors used correctly; unknown why left patterns in row5 but not aligned to expected.
 * Train2: Generated detected small rows (1:2/2? but shown as 2/2 wait, input not shown but output has row1:2's left, row3:1's left, row5:2's middle +3 left?); large layer partially captured (1's at rows8-9 cols10-16? but misplaced); added layers wrong—e.g., row7 has 1's left +3 but expected row7:1's left +1's middle no 3; row12-13 has 1's middle +3's right but expected row11-12:1's middle +3's right; extra 3's appear in row5/7/13/15 but expected only in specific spots like row5 col5, row11-12 cols16-17, row14-15 cols16-17; row4 has unexpected 2's middle; seems extra blocks added too often or wrong colors/spacing.
 * Train3: Bg=1 detected; small rows at 1(2/3),3(3/3),5(3/4); no large layer detected (since cols8+ all bg=1, so blocks=[] returns early, no additions); generated unchanged from input? But output shows left patterns in rows1,3,5,6? and bottom layers at rows15-17(3's),21-22(3/4) but expected has middle layers at rows10-11(2/3),15-17(3's),21-22(3/4); generated misses middle 2/3 entirely and places 3/4 too early/wrong; also row15-17 has 3's but shifted left/no 4's integrated; function find_large_layer broken here as no cols8+ non-bg, so skips all additions—unhelpful for cases without right-side large layer.
 * Overall: Layer stacking deltas wrong (e.g., is_top logic places downward but with incorrect 2h vs 2h-1, leading to overlaps/shifts); clipping helps but doesn't fix miscalculations; color assignment uses small row correctly but p limits it (good); extra block via has_col5 triggers but positioning (last + spacing) misaligns; w=h assumption okay but untested; program doesn't handle no-large-layer (just returns copy, but train3 needs additions? Wait, train3 expected has added bottom layers despite no large—major flaw).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it replicates some left small-row patterns (e.g., row1:1's at col1/3, row3:4's col1/3 +2 col5, row5:1/4/1 left, row6:1/4 left) and detects a large layer around rows10-13 (4's cols13-16, 2's cols18-21) and adds bottom layers at rows18-21 (4's +4's? +2's but colors wrong, expected likely 4's then 1's or per small), rows23-26 (1's cols13-16 +4's cols18-21 +1's cols24-27); but placements are shifted—e.g., row7 has unexpected 8 at col1 (bg=3, but 8!=3, possible overwrite error); row18-21 has 4's/2's but expected probably mirrored or color-swapped per small rows (e.g., using colors from row1/3/5 like 1,4,2); extra blocks added (e.g., row18-21 has extra 4's cols18-21 then 2's, but misaligned spacing); bottom rows23-26 have 1's/4's/1's but likely wrong colors (small row5 has 1/4/1? but p=2 for large? so extra via col5?); overall, similar to trains: left patterns kept but added layers misplaced vertically (gaps wrong, e.g., row14-17 all bg but expected may have more stacking), and right blocks not fully extended (27 cols suggest more blocks possible); doesn't match because training logic fails analogously—no large in trains3 but test has one, yet stacking buggy.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg via frequency.)

```python
def find_min_fg(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> int:
    candidates = [c for row in g for c in row if c != bg]
    return min(candidates) if candidates else bg
```
(Helpful: Gets lowest foreground color for default additions.)

```python
def find_large_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]]:
    # (Full flood-fill based detection of filled rectangular components >1 cell)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'y1', 'y2', 'x1', 'x2', 'color', 'h', 'w'
```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

```python
def has_special(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int, blocks: tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]], y1: int, h: int, large_color: int, min_fg: int) -> tp.Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if not blocks:
        return False, 0
    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step
        if p1 >= 0:
            added.append(p1)
            p2 = y1 - 2 * step
            if p2 >= 0:
                added.append(p2)
    return added
```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

```python
def add_rectangle(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], py: int, x1: int, x2: int, color: int, h: int, n: int):
    for i in range(h):
        yy = py + i
        if 0 <= yy < n:
            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements across **all** train input/output pairs (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every example, based on the provided data (e.g., colors, positions, sizes, holes, pixels). I have excluded anything inconsistent (e.g., variable y-spacing rules for additions, which differ between train 2's tight spacing and train 3's wider spacing, so marked as unknown), irrelevant (e.g., asymmetrical empty spaces not affecting changes), or non-interactive (e.g., isolated small components without demonstrated effects). No high-level puzzle solution or transformation explanation is attempted or implied—only direct, verifiable links. Where a connection exists but its mechanism is not explainable from the data, it is called out as unknown.

#### 1. **Foreground Components ↔ Background (Holes Property)**
   - Each foreground component (any colored rectangle, small or large) consistently increases the background's `holes` count by exactly 1.
   - Total `holes` in background = exact count of all foreground components in the image.
   - Consistent effect: Foreground presence directly "punches" one hole per component into the background, regardless of size, color, or position.
   - Seen in: All train inputs (e.g., train 1 input: 8 fg → 8 holes; train 2 input: 12 fg → 12 holes) and outputs (e.g., train 1 output: 12 fg → 12 holes, after adding 4 fg).

#### 2. **Foreground Components ↔ Background (Pixels Property)**
   - Sum of all foreground `pixels` consistently reduces the background's `pixels` by exactly that total amount.
   - Background `pixels` = total grid pixels (inferred as (max bbox coord + 1)^2, e.g., 23x23=529 for bbox max=22) minus sum of all foreground `pixels`.
   - Consistent effect: Foreground area directly subtracts from background fill, assuming a fixed grid size per image (no overlaps between fg components).
   - Seen in: All train inputs (e.g., train 1 input: fg total 24 pixels → bg 505 = 529-24) and outputs (e.g., train 1 output: fg total 60 pixels → bg 469 = 529-60, after adding 36 fg pixels).

#### 3. **Small 1-Pixel Foreground Components (Low y, Low x) → Preservation in Output**
   - All 1-pixel (1x1 bbox, `pixels=1`) foreground components located at low y-coordinates (y ≤7) and low x-coordinates (x ≤5) remain completely unchanged (same color, exact bbox position, size, `pixels=1`, `holes=0`).
   - Consistent effect: These specific components have no transformation or movement; they are static and do not affect other elements (e.g., no color propagation or position shift observed).
   - Interaction limit: They do not interact with larger components or background beyond the general fg ↔ bg rules above.
   - Seen in: All train pairs (e.g., train 1: yellow at [1,1] and [3,1], blues at [1,3]/[3,3]/[1,5]/[3,5] identical in input/output; train 2: reds/blues/greens at y1/3/5/7 x1/3/5 identical; train 3: red/green/yellow at y1/3/5 x1/3 identical).

#### 4. **Larger Foreground Components (>1 Pixel) → Preservation and Addition in Output**
   - All larger (>1 `pixels`) foreground components in input are preserved unchanged (same color, bbox position, size, `pixels`, `holes=0`) in output.
   - Outputs consistently add new larger components with:
     - Exact same dimensions (width = x2-x1+1, height = y2-y1+1, thus same `pixels`) as the input's larger components.
     - Same x-range(s) (bbox x1-x2) as the input's larger components (e.g., matching columns).
   - Consistent effect: Input larger components "seed" identical-sized duplicates in x-aligned positions; added components interact with background via holes/pixels rules (each adds 1 hole, subtracts its pixels).
   - Unknown: Exact y-positioning rule for additions (e.g., below in train 1/2, above in train 3; spacing varies: +3/+5 in train 1/3 vs. +2/+3 in train 2—cannot explain consistently).
   - Seen in: All train pairs (e.g., train 1: input 9px/3x3 yellows at x8-10/13-15 y1-3 preserved, adds 4 new 9px/3x3 at same x; train 2: input 4px/2x2 reds at x10-11/13-14 y4-5 preserved, adds 8 new 4px/2x2 at same x; train 3: input 4px/2x2 green/yellow at x11-12/16-17 y20-21 preserved, adds 4 new 4px/2x2 at same x).

#### 5. **Larger Foreground Components (Color Property) → Added Components (Color Property)**
   - Colors of added larger components are always from the set of colors present in the small 1-pixel components of the same image (e.g., yellow/blue in train 1; red/blue/green in train 2/3).
   - Consistent effect: Input larger component colors do not directly propagate (added colors often differ, e.g., yellow input → blue added in train 1), but added colors are constrained to the small components' color palette—no new colors introduced.
   - Unknown: Specific color assignment rule for additions (e.g., why blue in train 1 vs. red/green in train 3—varies and not explainable consistently; purple mentioned in description but absent in train data, so no connection identifiable).
   - Seen in: All train pairs (e.g., train 1 small colors: yellow/blue → added blues only; train 2 small: red/blue/green → added blue/green only; train 3 small: red/green/yellow → added red/green only).

#### 6. **All Foreground Components (General Properties)**
   - All foreground components (small or large) consistently have `holes=0` (solid, no internal gaps) and uniform color fill within their bbox.
   - No consistent interaction with edges/silhouettes/movement beyond position preservation for small ones and x-aligned addition for large ones (e.g., no observed effects from bbox edges on transformations).
   - Background color remains unchanged (e.g., maroon in train 1/2, blue in train 3), with no interaction to fg colors or positions.

No other consistent interactions identifiable (e.g., no reliable position → color links across all, as y-effects on color vary; no hole count or pixel count effects beyond bg; no purple interactions in train data). Test input follows the same fg ↔ bg rules (12 fg → 12 holes; fg 42 pixels → bg 687 on 27x27=729 grid) but no output provided for verification.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:27:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

[2025-10-03 08:27:56] Response:
- **Colored squares**: Small, solid-filled squares in yellow, blue, red, and purple hues, arranged in clustered pairs or small grids (e.g., 2x2 blocks or linear rows) within both input (yellow and blue on maroon background) and output (yellow, blue, red, purple on green background).
- **Backgrounds**: Solid, uniform fills—maroon (dark red) in input, green in output—serving as the base canvas for the squares.
- **Spatial arrangements**: Asymmetrical positioning with squares aligned in top-left clusters, mid-level rows, and spaced-out pairs, creating incomplete or evolving patterns across input to output.
- **Overall structure**: Non-grid, free-form layout resembling visual analogy puzzles, with empty space emphasizing the colored elements' relationships and transformations.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 08:27:56] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Colored squares**: Small, solid-filled squares in yellow, blue, red, and purple hues, arranged in clustered pairs or small grids (e.g., 2x2 blocks or linear rows) within both input (yellow and blue on maroon background) and output (yellow, blue, red, purple on green background).
- **Backgrounds**: Solid, uniform fills—maroon (dark red) in input, green in output—serving as the base canvas for the squares.
- **Spatial arrangements**: Asymmetrical positioning with squares aligned in top-left clusters, mid-level rows, and spaced-out pairs, creating incomplete or evolving patterns across input to output.
- **Overall structure**: Non-grid, free-form layout resembling visual analogy puzzles, with empty space emphasizing the colored elements' relationships and transformations.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** train input-output pair (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to direct, verifiable relationships between elements (e.g., preservation, pixel/hole transfers) that hold without exception. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Connections that vary (e.g., specific color changes like yellow → blue, or exact y-position shifts) or appear in only some examples (e.g., new x-positions in train 2) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., exact rules for new block colors, y-positions, or counts) are noted as such.

#### Components Identified (Consistent Across All Examples)
- **Small 1-pixel foreground blocks**: Solid-filled, single-pixel (pixels=1), holes=0, various colors (e.g., yellow, blue, red, green). Always positioned in clustered or row-like arrangements (e.g., top-left asymmetry).
- **Large multi-pixel foreground blocks**: Solid-filled, multi-pixel (pixels>1, e.g., 4 or 9), holes=0, uniform color within each block. Positioned with bbox indicating rectangular or block shapes.
- **Background**: Full-canvas element (bbox=[0,0,22,22] in all trains), solid color (maroon or blue), with holes>0 and majority of total pixels. Serves as the base layer.

Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated small blocks without downstream effects, or bbox widths/heights unless tied to preservation) are excluded. No semantic meanings (e.g., "patterns" or "grids") are assumed, as they cannot be verified consistently from the data.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These are pairwise or multi-way relationships where one element directly affects or relates to another, observed identically in every train pair. Only properties like color, pixels, holes, and presence are used where they show direct, unchanging links.

1. **Foreground blocks (small and large) ↔ Preservation in output**:
   - All small 1-pixel blocks and large multi-pixel blocks from input are fully preserved unchanged in output (same color, holes=0, bbox, pixels, position).
   - Connection type: Position → position (exact match); color → color (unchanged); pixels → pixels (unchanged); holes → holes (remain 0).
   - Consistent effect: No input foreground block is removed, altered, or merged; they coexist with any new additions.
   - No exceptions across trains.

2. **New large multi-pixel blocks ↔ Background (pixels transfer)**:
   - New large blocks (multi-pixel, holes=0, various colors) are added in every output; their total pixels exactly equal the decrease in background pixels (input bg pixels - output bg pixels = sum of new blocks' pixels).
   - Examples: Train 1 (36 pixels added, bg -36); Train 2 (32 pixels added, bg -32); Train 3 (16 pixels added, bg -16).
   - Connection type: Background pixels → new block pixels (direct subtraction/transfer); no effect on small blocks.
   - Consistent effect: Background pixels are reduced precisely by the pixels "used" to create new large blocks. (Unknown: source of exact pixel counts for new blocks, as they match input large sizes but multiply in number variably.)

3. **New large multi-pixel blocks ↔ Background (holes increase)**:
   - Background holes increase exactly by the number of new large blocks added (one hole per new block).
   - Examples: Train 1 (+4 holes, 4 new blocks); Train 2 (+8 holes, 8 new blocks); Train 3 (+4 holes, 4 new blocks).
   - Connection type: Number of new blocks → background holes (+1 per block); holes in new blocks remain 0 (no transfer).
   - Consistent effect: Each new large block creates one additional hole in the background, independent of block size or color. (Unknown: why holes increase only for large blocks, not small ones, as no small blocks are added.)

4. **Background ↔ Color preservation**:
   - Background color remains identical from input to output (e.g., maroon → maroon in trains 1-2; blue → blue in train 3).
   - Connection type: Background color → background color (unchanged); no direct effect on foreground colors.
   - Consistent effect: Background acts as a stable base layer, unaffected in color by additions or foreground interactions.

5. **Foreground blocks (all) ↔ Holes (non-interaction)**:
   - All small and large foreground blocks consistently have holes=0, with no change or transfer to/from background holes.
   - Connection type: None direct (holes remain isolated to background); foreground holes do not affect or respond to background holes.
   - Consistent effect: Foreground blocks are "solid" (holes=0) and do not contribute to or alter hole counts anywhere.

#### Notes on Unknowns/Inconsistencies (Not Forced Connections)
- **New block properties (color, y-position, x-position, count)**: These vary (e.g., added colors are blue in train 1, blue+green in 2, red+green in 3; y-positions shift differently, e.g., downward in 1-2, upward in 3; x-positions match input larges in 1 and 3 but introduce new x=16 in 2). No consistent link (e.g., input color → new color or position → position) holds across all; possible interaction with small block arrangements exists but cannot be verified as direct/consistent without visuals.
- **Total pixels**: Background starts with > total canvas pixels in some cases (e.g., train 3: 515 > 484), but decreases consistently via transfer—no explanation for initial excess.
- **No other interactions**: No consistent links for bbox dimensions (e.g., widths vary without pattern), specific shape silhouettes/edges (not quantifiable here), or movement transformations (e.g., no uniform direction or trigger). Small blocks do not consistently affect large block properties beyond preservation.


============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 08:29:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists of integers representing visual elements like shapes, objects, or patterns), where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes training examples and a test input to produce correct outputs, possibly extracting or classifying objects based on puzzle rules. The previous attempt failed entirely due to a structural issue in the generated code, preventing any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function, as its absence causes immediate validation errors across all examples; this is a core structural requirement, not related to puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid patterns for objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, or connected components), with rules for extraction, counting features like holes or connections, and matching against expected outputs—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or incomplete spans across the grid.
 * Training examples are provided to infer rules (e.g., what constitutes a valid object or transformation), and the test input must be processed similarly without overfitting; subtle elements include omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching criteria like hole count) and ensuring outputs exactly match expected formats.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle logic was tested due to errors, but future attempts should include functions for grid parsing (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) and validation against training data; watch for mismatches in blob shapes, object omission, or grid boundaries that could alter connectivity.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must be deterministic and exact (no approximations); grids may have noise or separators that need filtering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function and any puzzle-specific logic. Future attempts should include grid-processing utilities like those below for object extraction.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful type for puzzle elements (not from previous attempt)
class PuzzleObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but recommended for future use)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[PuzzleObject]:
    # Use flood-fill or DFS to find connected components/objects in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []  # Collect positions
                # Implement DFS or BFS here to trace connected cells
                # Count holes if needed (e.g., enclosed zeros)
                hole_count = 0  # Placeholder: implement hole detection
                objects.append(PuzzleObject(component, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated code completely omitted the required 'program' function, leading to errors in all training examples and the test input—no puzzle logic was executed or evaluated.
 * No object extraction or grid processing was possible, so issues like blob shape mismatches, object omission (e.g., based on hole count or validity), or handling dividers/separators could not be assessed.
 * No helpful functions were provided; any future code without 'program' is structurally broken and irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * Training examples 1-3 all failed identically due to the missing function, indicating a total lack of adherence to code format requirements—subtle puzzle rules (e.g., connectivity in grids) remain untested.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the puzzle, as even basic validation failed for unknown reasons related to code generation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates invalid code rather than a puzzle solution (e.g., no processed grid output, object list, or classification).
 * It is different from expected because a valid test output should apply inferred puzzle rules to the test grid (e.g., extracting and describing objects like shapes with holes), but nothing was generated—likely missing key elements like object positions, counts, or matches to training patterns.
 * This error prevents checking if the test handles subtleties like unique grid configurations (e.g., non-spanning keys or irregular objects), confirming the output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 likely as a special case or background) where the goal is to detect and extend patterns of horizontal blocks and vertical "tracks" (likely signal columns) to place additional colored blocks in empty spaces, following rules for anchoring, gaps, and subsequence matching to complete a symmetric or patterned output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) must be correctly identified as the uniform row color or default to top-left; it's crucial for distinguishing signals and blocks from empty space, but the code mishandles cases where bg is 0.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (odd indices) with exactly one non-bg cell per column to qualify as signals; multiple consecutive non-bg cells disqualify them, enforcing isolated signal points.
 * Signal rows are those containing any non-bg cell in a track; colors in these rows (per track) form sequences that must match block color patterns via subsequence checking.
 * Horizontal blocks are consecutive non-bg cells of the same color in rows, but only those of length >=2 are considered; all blocks must have consistent height h (vertical span), or the puzzle fails validation.
 * Anchoring involves sliding a window of height h over rows to find where existing blocks' colors form a subsequence matching one signal color sequence; this anchors the pattern for extensions.
 * Placement extends blocks forward/backward from the anchor using steps (df=2h-1 forward, db=2h+1 backward), with fixed gaps between blocks; new blocks are placed only in bg cells, but overplacement or out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Subtleties: Assumes consistent h across blocks (inconsistent leads to no-op return); subsequence matching is loose (allows extra elements in signal); gaps are fixed from initial blocks; odd-column bias for tracks may miss even-column signals; 0/bg confusion in validation (e.g., "cell == 0 or cell == g[0][0] and g[0][0] == 0" is buggy); no rotation or vertical blocks considered; assumes square grid.
 * Edge cases: No tracks/signals/blocks result in unchanged grid; extension stops at grid edges; multiple signals per row/track not handled beyond collection; colors must be uniform per block vertically/horizontally.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for isolation.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):  # Odd columns only
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                if consec > max_consec:
                    max_consec = consec
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts signal tracks with isolated non-bg cells; helpful but assumes odd columns and single-cell isolation.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                signal_set.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))

def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(These collect signal positions and per-row color sequences from tracks; essential for pattern matching, but assumes one color per track per row.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(This finds horizontal block spans of same color >=2 wide; useful for detecting existing patterns, but collects across all rows without vertical consistency check.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence checker; key for matching block colors to signals, allows non-contiguous matches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt failed completely due to syntax errors (invalid code like stray "wait no..." comment in find_anchor at line ~88), preventing any execution or output generation.
 * What worked: Basic structure for extracting bg, tracks, signals, and blocks is logically sound and puzzle-aligned; subsequence matching and gap calculation capture core pattern extension ideas.
 * What didn't work: Syntax errors caused total failure (no outputs generated); find_anchor has incomplete/broken validation logic (e.g., unfinished bg checks, assumes uniform h without enforcement); placement logic (extend_ranges_for_placement, place_at) is overly rigid (fixed steps df/db, gap-based extension) and doesn't handle variable gaps, rotations, or non-odd tracks; no handling for multiple anchors or failed matches beyond no-op; assumes all blocks same height h, which may not hold; ignores even columns for tracks, potentially missing signals.
 * anchor finding (find_anchor) is broken/not helpful due to syntax and vague validation (e.g., skips bg cells incorrectly, doesn't enforce vertical uniformity properly); don't use in future without fixes.
 * get_gap and extend_ranges_for_placement are partially helpful for spacing but assume fixed gaps and forward-only extension, which may not fit puzzle symmetries.
 * Overall, the attempt shows partial understanding of signal/block detection but fails on integration and execution; training examples all errored identically, indicating no progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error due to syntax, so no grid is generated; this does not make sense or match any expected puzzle completion, as the program doesn't run to produce a modified grid.
 * Without valid execution, cannot verify if placements align with test input's patterns (e.g., expected block extensions or signal matches); the error prevents any comparison, confirming the output is incorrect and unhelpful.
 * To handle test cases, future attempts must fix syntax, add robust error handling for inconsistent h/gaps, and validate against expected symmetric placements (e.g., mirroring signals around anchor).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[tuple]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block placement where "small rows" (sparse patterned rows at specific odd indices like 1,3,5,7) serve as control instructions to replicate or extend "large layers" (dense block structures starting around row 8 or similar) into additional stacked or mirrored layers across the grid, using the background color (bg, e.g., 8, 1, or 3) to identify empty space and ensuring layers fit within grid bounds without overwriting existing content unless it's bg.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) varies per example (8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test) and must be dynamically detected (e.g., from g[0][0]); all non-bg cells are potential blocks or instructions.
 * Small rows are candidates at fixed odd indices (1,3,5,7) but only qualify if positions 1 and/or 3 are non-bg; these rows provide color cues for new layers (e.g., g[sr][1] as first color, g[sr][3] as second, g[sr][5] optionally as third if non-bg).
 * Large layers are identified in lower/middle grid sections (e.g., starting at min row with non-bg in cols 8+), consisting of horizontal blocks defined by start col, width, and color; spacing between blocks (e.g., from first to second block) must be preserved for alignment in new layers.
 * Layer placement logic depends on large layer position: if top-half (is_top = large_start < n//2), stack downward with spacing like 2*h or 2*h-1 (h=height of large layer); if bottom-half, stack upward with fixed d=2*h+1; always clip to [0, n-h] to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * New layers (for k=1 to t-1, where t=len(small_rows)) copy the large layer's structure (start cols, widths) but use small row colors; optionally add an extra block if has_col5 (g[sr][5] non-bg) at position after last block + spacing, with width assumed square (w=h).
 * Only overwrite bg cells in new layers to avoid corrupting existing content; if no small rows or no large blocks, output unchanged grid.
 * Subtle: Number of blocks p in large layer limits colors from small row (e.g., only use first p colors); assume square blocks if no widths (w=h); handle variable grid sizes (23x23 in trains, ~27x27 in test); potential for 0-4 small rows, leading to 0-3 added layers.
 * Easy to miss: Large layer height h is max-min row span of non-bg in cols 8+ (not full grid height); blocks in large layer skip bg cols; downward stacking may use varying deltas (e.g., 2h for full, 2h-1 for partial); extra block only if p>=1 and col5 non-bg; test has more cols (27), so large layer blocks extend further right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is reliable for non-destructive modification.)

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Accurately detects varying bg like 8,1,3 from top-left.)

```python
def get_small_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    candidates = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    n = len(g)
    return [r for r in candidates if r < n and g[r][1] != bg and g[r][3] != bg]
```
(Helpful for identifying control rows, but note it requires both col1 and col3 non-bg—may miss rows with only one; in train3, it would catch rows 1,3,5 with patterns like 2/3,3/3,3/4.)

```python
def has_col5(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, r: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    return 0 <= r < n and g[r][5] != bg
```
(Useful for detecting optional third block in small rows, e.g., triggers extra in train2 row5 with 3 at col5.)

```python
def find_large_layer(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, 0, []
    m = len(g[0])
    large_rs = [r for r in range(n) if any(c != bg for c in g[r][8:m])]
    if not large_rs:
        return 0, 0, []
    start_r = min(large_rs)
    h = max(large_rs) - start_r + 1
    blocks = []
    i = 8
    while i < m:
        if g[start_r][i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        colr = g[start_r][i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < m and g[start_r][j] == colr:
            j += 1
        w = j - i
        blocks.append((i, w, colr))
        i = j
    return start_r, h, blocks
```
(This correctly extracts the large layer's start row, height, and block list (start_col, width, color) from cols 8+ in the first non-empty row of the span; helpful for base structure, but assumes blocks only in start_r—may miss vertical variations; works for train1's 4-blocks at cols~8-16.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core placement logic is flawed despite detecting bg, small rows, and large layers.
 * Train1: Generated correctly placed initial small rows (1-3: left 4/1 patterns, middle 4's) and detected large layer (1's at rows7-9, cols8-16), but misplaced added layers—e.g., left 1's appear in row5 (unexpected, overwrites empty) instead of row5 empty/row6 middle 1's; bottom 1's duplicated at rows12-14 but shifted up one row from expected rows12-14 (expected has gap at row10-11); no extra block added, but p=2 so only two colors used correctly; unknown why left patterns in row5 but not aligned to expected.
 * Train2: Generated detected small rows (1:2/2? but shown as 2/2 wait, input not shown but output has row1:2's left, row3:1's left, row5:2's middle +3 left?); large layer partially captured (1's at rows8-9 cols10-16? but misplaced); added layers wrong—e.g., row7 has 1's left +3 but expected row7:1's left +1's middle no 3; row12-13 has 1's middle +3's right but expected row11-12:1's middle +3's right; extra 3's appear in row5/7/13/15 but expected only in specific spots like row5 col5, row11-12 cols16-17, row14-15 cols16-17; row4 has unexpected 2's middle; seems extra blocks added too often or wrong colors/spacing.
 * Train3: Bg=1 detected; small rows at 1(2/3),3(3/3),5(3/4); no large layer detected (since cols8+ all bg=1, so blocks=[] returns early, no additions); generated unchanged from input? But output shows left patterns in rows1,3,5,6? and bottom layers at rows15-17(3's),21-22(3/4) but expected has middle layers at rows10-11(2/3),15-17(3's),21-22(3/4); generated misses middle 2/3 entirely and places 3/4 too early/wrong; also row15-17 has 3's but shifted left/no 4's integrated; function find_large_layer broken here as no cols8+ non-bg, so skips all additions—unhelpful for cases without right-side large layer.
 * Overall: Layer stacking deltas wrong (e.g., is_top logic places downward but with incorrect 2h vs 2h-1, leading to overlaps/shifts); clipping helps but doesn't fix miscalculations; color assignment uses small row correctly but p limits it (good); extra block via has_col5 triggers but positioning (last + spacing) misaligns; w=h assumption okay but untested; program doesn't handle no-large-layer (just returns copy, but train3 needs additions? Wait, train3 expected has added bottom layers despite no large—major flaw).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it replicates some left small-row patterns (e.g., row1:1's at col1/3, row3:4's col1/3 +2 col5, row5:1/4/1 left, row6:1/4 left) and detects a large layer around rows10-13 (4's cols13-16, 2's cols18-21) and adds bottom layers at rows18-21 (4's +4's? +2's but colors wrong, expected likely 4's then 1's or per small), rows23-26 (1's cols13-16 +4's cols18-21 +1's cols24-27); but placements are shifted—e.g., row7 has unexpected 8 at col1 (bg=3, but 8!=3, possible overwrite error); row18-21 has 4's/2's but expected probably mirrored or color-swapped per small rows (e.g., using colors from row1/3/5 like 1,4,2); extra blocks added (e.g., row18-21 has extra 4's cols18-21 then 2's, but misaligned spacing); bottom rows23-26 have 1's/4's/1's but likely wrong colors (small row5 has 1/4/1? but p=2 for large? so extra via col5?); overall, similar to trains: left patterns kept but added layers misplaced vertically (gaps wrong, e.g., row14-17 all bg but expected may have more stacking), and right blocks not fully extended (27 cols suggest more blocks possible); doesn't match because training logic fails analogously—no large in trains3 but test has one, yet stacking buggy.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg via frequency.)

```python
def find_min_fg(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> int:
    candidates = [c for row in g for c in row if c != bg]
    return min(candidates) if candidates else bg
```
(Helpful: Gets lowest foreground color for default additions.)

```python
def find_large_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]]:
    # (Full flood-fill based detection of filled rectangular components >1 cell)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'y1', 'y2', 'x1', 'x2', 'color', 'h', 'w'
```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

```python
def has_special(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int, blocks: tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]], y1: int, h: int, large_color: int, min_fg: int) -> tp.Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if not blocks:
        return False, 0
    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step
        if p1 >= 0:
            added.append(p1)
            p2 = y1 - 2 * step
            if p2 >= 0:
                added.append(p2)
    return added
```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

```python
def add_rectangle(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], py: int, x1: int, x2: int, color: int, h: int, n: int):
    for i in range(h):
        yy = py + i
        if 0 <= yy < n:
            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on the provided train examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** train input-output pair (1, 2, and 3). These are limited to direct, verifiable relationships between elements (e.g., preservation, pixel/hole transfers) that hold without exception. No high-level interpretations, solutions, or forced explanations are included. Connections that vary (e.g., specific color changes like yellow → blue, or exact y-position shifts) or appear in only some examples (e.g., new x-positions in train 2) are excluded. Unknown or inconsistent aspects (e.g., exact rules for new block colors, y-positions, or counts) are noted as such.

#### Components Identified (Consistent Across All Examples)
- **Small 1-pixel foreground blocks**: Solid-filled, single-pixel (pixels=1), holes=0, various colors (e.g., yellow, blue, red, green). Always positioned in clustered or row-like arrangements (e.g., top-left asymmetry).
- **Large multi-pixel foreground blocks**: Solid-filled, multi-pixel (pixels>1, e.g., 4 or 9), holes=0, uniform color within each block. Positioned with bbox indicating rectangular or block shapes.
- **Background**: Full-canvas element (bbox=[0,0,22,22] in all trains), solid color (maroon or blue), with holes>0 and majority of total pixels. Serves as the base layer.

Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., isolated small blocks without downstream effects, or bbox widths/heights unless tied to preservation) are excluded. No semantic meanings (e.g., "patterns" or "grids") are assumed, as they cannot be verified consistently from the data.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections
These are pairwise or multi-way relationships where one element directly affects or relates to another, observed identically in every train pair. Only properties like color, pixels, holes, and presence are used where they show direct, unchanging links.

1. **Foreground blocks (small and large) ↔ Preservation in output**:
   - All small 1-pixel blocks and large multi-pixel blocks from input are fully preserved unchanged in output (same color, holes=0, bbox, pixels, position).
   - Connection type: Position → position (exact match); color → color (unchanged); pixels → pixels (unchanged); holes → holes (remain 0).
   - Consistent effect: No input foreground block is removed, altered, or merged; they coexist with any new additions.
   - No exceptions across trains.

2. **New large multi-pixel blocks ↔ Background (pixels transfer)**:
   - New large blocks (multi-pixel, holes=0, various colors) are added in every output; their total pixels exactly equal the decrease in background pixels (input bg pixels - output bg pixels = sum of new blocks' pixels).
   - Examples: Train 1 (36 pixels added, bg -36); Train 2 (32 pixels added, bg -32); Train 3 (16 pixels added, bg -16).
   - Connection type: Background pixels → new block pixels (direct subtraction/transfer); no effect on small blocks.
   - Consistent effect: Background pixels are reduced precisely by the pixels "used" to create new large blocks. (Unknown: source of exact pixel counts for new blocks, as they match input large sizes but multiply in number variably.)

3. **New large multi-pixel blocks ↔ Background (holes increase)**:
   - Background holes increase exactly by the number of new large blocks added (one hole per new block).
   - Examples: Train 1 (+4 holes, 4 new blocks); Train 2 (+8 holes, 8 new blocks); Train 3 (+4 holes, 4 new blocks).
   - Connection type: Number of new blocks → background holes (+1 per block); holes in new blocks remain 0 (no transfer).
   - Consistent effect: Each new large block creates one additional hole in the background, independent of block size or color. (Unknown: why holes increase only for large blocks, not small ones, as no small blocks are added.)

4. **Background ↔ Color preservation**:
   - Background color remains identical from input to output (e.g., maroon → maroon in trains 1-2; blue → blue in train 3).
   - Connection type: Background color → background color (unchanged); no direct effect on foreground colors.
   - Consistent effect: Background acts as a stable base layer, unaffected in color by additions or foreground interactions.

5. **Foreground blocks (all) ↔ Holes (non-interaction)**:
   - All small and large foreground blocks consistently have holes=0, with no change or transfer to/from background holes.
   - Connection type: None direct (holes remain isolated to background); foreground holes do not affect or respond to background holes.
   - Consistent effect: Foreground blocks are "solid" (holes=0) and do not contribute to or alter hole counts anywhere.

#### Notes on Unknowns/Inconsistencies (Not Forced Connections)
- **New block properties (color, y-position, x-position, count)**: These vary (e.g., added colors are blue in train 1, blue+green in 2, red+green in 3; y-positions shift differently, e.g., downward in 1-2, upward in 3; x-positions match input larges in 1 and 3 but introduce new x=16 in 2). No consistent link (e.g., input color → new color or position → position) holds across all; possible interaction with small block arrangements exists but cannot be verified as direct/consistent without visuals.
- **Total pixels**: Background starts with > total canvas pixels in some cases (e.g., train 3: 515 > 484), but decreases consistently via transfer—no explanation for initial excess.
- **No other interactions**: No consistent links for bbox dimensions (e.g., widths vary without pattern), specific shape silhouettes/edges (not quantifiable here), or movement transformations (e.g., no uniform direction or trigger). Small blocks do not consistently affect large block properties beyond preservation.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:38:12] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid safely for output.)

```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(Reliably finds bg from uniform row or top-left; helpful for noisy grids.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                max_consec = max(max_consec, consec)
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(Extracts valid signal tracks: odd columns with only single isolated non-bg cells; essential for identifying signal columns.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    signal_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                signal_set.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))
```
(Finds rows with signals in tracks; crucial for sequencing.)

```python
def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(Extracts per-signal-row color sequences from tracks; key for subsequence matching.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            while j < size and g[i][j] == g[i][start]:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(Collects unique horizontal block positions (width >=2); useful for detecting patterns but note: doesn't capture colors or verticality directly—pair with other funcs.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

[2025-10-03 08:38:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 08:58:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Finds the dominant background color reliably.)

```python
def normalize_grid(grid: List[List[int]], mapping: dict) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[mapping.get(cell, cell) for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(Standardizes colors; mapping like {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0} is fixed and crucial for consistency across examples.)

```python
def extract_key(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    key = []
    for r in range(1, 8, 2):
        if r >= size:
            break
        row_key = [grid[r][c] for c in [1, 3, 5] if c < size and grid[r][c] != bg]
        if row_key:
            key.append(row_key)
    return key
```
(Extracts key sequences from left-side positions in odd rows; filters non-bg; extend range if size > typical 23x23.)

```python
def find_source_block(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> tuple:
    center_start = size // 4
    center_end = 3 * size // 4
    source_start = -1
    source_h = 0
    block_configs = []
    for r in range(size):
        current_runs = []
        i = 0
        while i < size:
            if grid[r][i] == bg or i < center_start or i > center_end:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_c = i
            color = grid[r][i]
            while i < size and grid[r][i] == color and center_start <= i <= center_end:
                i += 1
            w = i - start_c
            if w >= 2:
                current_runs.append((start_c, w, color))
        has_middle = len(current_runs) > 0
        if has_middle:
            if source_start == -1:
                source_start = r
                source_h = 1
                block_configs = current_runs[:]
            else:
                if len(current_runs) == len(block_configs) and all(cr == bc for cr, bc in zip(current_runs, block_configs)):
                    source_h += 1
                else:
                    break
        else:
            if source_start != -1:
                break
    return source_start, source_h, block_configs
```
(Detects central source block by matching run configs (start, width, color) across consecutive rows; restricts to center horizontally; returns start row, height, and configs.)

```python
def fill_level(out: List[List[int]], t_start: int, h: int, source_blocks: List[tuple], key_row: List[int], source_n: int, source_w: int, size: int, bg_norm: int):
    num_b = len(key_row)
    current_blocks = []
    for b in range(num_b):
        if b < source_n:
            sc, w, _ = source_blocks[b]
            colr = key_row[b]
            current_blocks.append((sc, w, colr))
        else:
            prev_sc, prev_w, _ = current_blocks[-1]
            prev_end = prev_sc + prev_w - 1
            gap = source_w - 1
            sc = prev_end + 1 + gap
            w = source_w
            colr = key_row[b]
            if sc >= size:
                continue
            w = min(w, size - sc)
            if w >= 1:
                current_blocks.append((sc, w, colr))
    for jj in range(h):
        rr = t_start + jj
        if 0 <= rr < size:
            for sc, w, colr in current_blocks:
                for p in range(w):
                    cc = sc + p
                    if 0 <= cc < size and out[rr][cc] == bg_norm:
                        out[rr][cc] = colr
```
(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

[2025-10-03 08:58:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 09:15:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid completion where partial patterns (like colored blocks or evolving shapes) must be extended or filled vertically/horizontally based on detected motifs, such as uniform color blocks, single indicator cells, or evolving two-sided blocks with changing colors across "stages." The goal is to identify background color, locate key pattern starters (e.g., singles or blocks starting from column 7+), and replicate/extend them in predicted positions while preserving existing non-background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid; all fillings should only replace background cells, never overwrite existing non-background colors.
 * Patterns often start or are indicated by "singles": rows with exactly two non-background cells at specific positions (e.g., columns 1 and 3), which signal the color and row for extending a block elsewhere (e.g., in columns 7+).
 * Uniform blocks are vertical stacks (height >=2) of consistent non-background positions (at least 4 columns wide, starting from column 7) with a single color; these may need extension based on singles, using steps like 2*h -1 where h is block height, and potentially adding "extensions" (extra sub-blocks) if singles have extra non-background in column 5.
 * Evolution blocks are two adjacent sub-blocks (equal width >=2, separated by gap) with different left/right colors; they evolve by decrementing/incrementing the higher color toward the lower one across stages (e.g., if left=4, right=2, next stage left=3, right=2), placed in multiples of height h with gaps (e.g., 2*h or 3*h between stages); determine stage by available space above (if enough for full prior stages, fill backward; else fill forward/backward).
 * Sub-blocks are contiguous runs of non-background positions; gaps between sub-blocks matter for evolution (e.g., consistent gap size).
 * Vertical spacing: Patterns repeat every 2*h -1 or multiples of h + gaps (e.g., 2*h); ensure new placements don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Subtle: Color evolution prefers decrementing the higher side or incrementing the lower; equal colors may default to decrement left/increment right. Singles may indicate multiple instances (num_singles), with extensions only after the first one having column 5 non-background.
 * Overlaps or partial grids: Existing patterns shouldn't be overwritten; if a placement would conflict, skip or adjust (though not handled well in code). Grid size varies (23x23 in trains, 27x27? in test), so n=len(g).
 * Easy to miss: Block detection only scans from column 7+ (assuming left side is for indicators); inconsistent sub-block widths/gaps break detection; evolution assumes two sub-blocks only, fails on more/fewer.
 * All trains show partial detection (e.g., singles/blocks found) but incorrect placement (wrong rows, missing extensions, wrong colors); test likely similar.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test; essential for all fillings.)

```python
def find_singles(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    singles = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = g[i]
        nonb_pos = [j for j in range(n) if row[j] != b]
        if len(nonb_pos) == 2 and nonb_pos == [1, 3]:
            color = row[1]
            if row[3] == color:
                singles.append((i, color))
    return singles
```
(Partially helpful: Detects indicator rows with matching colors at cols 1/3; used in train1/2 to find starters like row3 color1, row5 color1; but misses if positions vary or more non-b exist; extendable for other indicator patterns.)

```python
def get_subblocks(pos: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not pos:
        return []
    pos = sorted(pos)
    sub = [pos[0]]
    subs = []
    for p in pos[1:]:
        if p == sub[-1] + 1:
            sub.append(p)
        else:
            subs.append(sub)
            sub = [p]
    subs.append(sub)
    return subs
```
(Helpful for splitting contiguous non-background runs, e.g., into left/right for evolution blocks; correctly identifies gaps, used in block detection.)

```python
def find_block(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[int], int] | None:
    # (code as provided; scans for vertical uniform blocks starting col7+, height>=2, single color, >=4 wide)
```
(Helpful in concept for uniform patterns like train1's 4-block at rows1-3 cols8-10/13-15; detects position/color but fails extension logic.)

```python
def find_evolution_block(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[int], List[int], int, int] | None:
    # (code as provided; scans for two equal-width sub-blocks with different colors, consistent vertically)
```
(Helpful for train2/3/test evolutions, e.g., train2 left1/right3 at rows7-8 cols10-12/16-17? Wait, positions vary; detects structure but evolution rules buggy: wrong stage detection, color changes, placements.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples incorrect; program detects background and some patterns (e.g., singles in train1 rows 1? Wait no, row3/5; blocks in train1 rows1-3) but fails to place extensions correctly (wrong rows, missing sub-blocks, no color adaptation).
 * Train1: Generated correctly keeps top block of 4's at rows1-3 cols8-10/13-15 and singles at rows1/3 cols1/3 (but row indices off?); what worked: detected uniform block and singles; what didn't: missed placing new 1-block at rows6-8 cols8-10/13-15 (expected has it, generated all background); also missed lower 1-block at rows11-13; singles extension logic broken (step=2*h-1=5, but placements skip or wrong start).
 * Train2: Generated places some singles (rows1 col1/3=2, row3=1, row5=2? partial, row7=1) and partial blocks (rows4-5 cols10-12/14-15=2, but expected has them; row7-8 cols10-12/14-15=1); what worked: partial evolution detection (left/right split); what didn't: missed full stage3 at rows10-12 cols10-12/14-15=1 and cols16-17=3; placements only partial, no forward extension; color evolution wrong (didn't increment to 3 on right).
 * Train3: Background=1 detected; generated places some left-side singles (rows1 col1/3=2/3? partial, row3=3, row5=3/4) and lower blocks (rows10-11 cols11-12=2 cols16-17=3, rows14-15 cols11-12/16-17=3); what worked: detected some vertical patterns; what didn't: missed upper evolutions (e.g., no row20-21 cols11-12=3 cols16-17=4); placements inconsistent (e.g., row15 has 3's but expected all1; row10-11 has 2/3 but expected same; no decrement logic for colors 2->1 or 3->2); singles not used for extensions.
 * Overall: uniform_block path triggers in train1 but extension loop buggy (new_start calc wrong, has_ext never triggers properly, new_sub placement off); evo_block in train2/3 but stage detection flawed (assumes fixed distances like 3*h or 2*h, wrong color rules e.g., always -1 higher even if equal); no handling for multiple blocks or overlaps; find_block assumes single color from first row only, breaks if varies slightly; find_evolution_block requires exact two subs, fails if more (e.g., train1 has two but gapped); get_subblocks good but underused.
 * Function find_singles is helpful but too rigid (only cols1/3, len==2); find_block partially works for uniforms but loop breaks early on len<4; find_evolution_block detects structure but consistency check too strict (requires all non-b only in left+right, misses if extras); program(g) copies grid but only fills if block found, else evo, but no fallback for neither.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The ext_dict in uniform path (uses col5, but train1 has no col5 non-b, so first_ext_k stays num, has_ext never true, no extensions added); evolution color logic arbitrary (e.g., if cl>cr: s2l=cl-1 s2r=cr, but train2 needs increment on lower side); gap2=2*h hardcoded, but trains vary (train2 gap~2 rows between stages?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it partially fills some patterns but misses key extensions and has wrong placements/colors, similar to trains.
 * What was generated: Upper left singles at row0 cols1/3=1, row3 cols1/3/5=4/2? (row3 has col5=2, but expected unknown); block at rows2-5 cols18-21=2 (4-wide uniform); lower block at rows10-13 cols13-16=4; very bottom rows22-25 cols13-16=4 but cols18-21=3 (partial evolution?); row7 has col1=8 (outlier).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from pattern/rules, since no expected given): Likely misses evolution of the 2-block (rows2-5 cols18-21=2) to next stage (e.g., if single-side, extend down with color+1=3 at similar pos, height h=4, step~7, around row12-15 but generated has 4's there instead); upper row6 cols5=1 not extended; bottom 4-block should evolve to 5 or split left/right but stays 4 and adds wrong 3's in cols18-21; left singles (1/4) not used to place blocks in cols7+ (e.g., no 1-block or 4-evolution); background=3 preserved but fillings overwrite minimally, missing multiple stages (e.g., if evo from row2, prior stage above row0 impossible, so add below at row2+h+gap~row9-12 with evolved colors, but generated skips); overall, detects some blocks but wrong evolution (no color change to 3/5), wrong positions (cols13-16=4 unrelated to upper 18-21=2), and no full grid completion (many rows all-background, expected more patterns).
 * Does not make sense: Partial fillings suggest detection works (e.g., uniform 2-block, 4-block) but extension/evo rules fail (hardcoded distances wrong for 27x27, color logic doesn't match trains' decrement/increment); looks like uniform path triggered wrongly instead of evo, leading to static copies rather than evolving.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 09:15:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists of integers representing visual elements like shapes, objects, or patterns), where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes training examples and a test input to produce correct outputs, possibly extracting or classifying objects based on puzzle rules. The previous attempt failed entirely due to a structural issue in the generated code, preventing any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function, as its absence causes immediate validation errors across all examples; this is a core structural requirement, not related to puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid patterns for objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, or connected components), with rules for extraction, counting features like holes or connections, and matching against expected outputs—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or incomplete spans across the grid.
 * Training examples are provided to infer rules (e.g., what constitutes a valid object or transformation), and the test input must be processed similarly without overfitting; subtle elements include omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching criteria like hole count) and ensuring outputs exactly match expected formats.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle logic was tested due to errors, but future attempts should include functions for grid parsing (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) and validation against training data; watch for mismatches in blob shapes, object omission, or grid boundaries that could alter connectivity.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must be deterministic and exact (no approximations); grids may have noise or separators that need filtering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function and any puzzle-specific logic. Future attempts should include grid-processing utilities like those below for object extraction.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful type for puzzle elements (not from previous attempt)
class PuzzleObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but recommended for future use)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[PuzzleObject]:
    # Use flood-fill or DFS to find connected components/objects in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []  # Collect positions
                # Implement DFS or BFS here to trace connected cells
                # Count holes if needed (e.g., enclosed zeros)
                hole_count = 0  # Placeholder: implement hole detection
                objects.append(PuzzleObject(component, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated code completely omitted the required 'program' function, leading to errors in all training examples and the test input—no puzzle logic was executed or evaluated.
 * No object extraction or grid processing was possible, so issues like blob shape mismatches, object omission (e.g., based on hole count or validity), or handling dividers/separators could not be assessed.
 * No helpful functions were provided; any future code without 'program' is structurally broken and irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * Training examples 1-3 all failed identically due to the missing function, indicating a total lack of adherence to code format requirements—subtle puzzle rules (e.g., connectivity in grids) remain untested.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the puzzle, as even basic validation failed for unknown reasons related to code generation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates invalid code rather than a puzzle solution (e.g., no processed grid output, object list, or classification).
 * It is different from expected because a valid test output should apply inferred puzzle rules to the test grid (e.g., extracting and describing objects like shapes with holes), but nothing was generated—likely missing key elements like object positions, counts, or matches to training patterns.
 * This error prevents checking if the test handles subtleties like unique grid configurations (e.g., non-spanning keys or irregular objects), confirming the output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 likely as a special case or background) where the goal is to detect and extend patterns of horizontal blocks and vertical "tracks" (likely signal columns) to place additional colored blocks in empty spaces, following rules for anchoring, gaps, and subsequence matching to complete a symmetric or patterned output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) must be correctly identified as the uniform row color or default to top-left; it's crucial for distinguishing signals and blocks from empty space, but the code mishandles cases where bg is 0.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (odd indices) with exactly one non-bg cell per column to qualify as signals; multiple consecutive non-bg cells disqualify them, enforcing isolated signal points.
 * Signal rows are those containing any non-bg cell in a track; colors in these rows (per track) form sequences that must match block color patterns via subsequence checking.
 * Horizontal blocks are consecutive non-bg cells of the same color in rows, but only those of length >=2 are considered; all blocks must have consistent height h (vertical span), or the puzzle fails validation.
 * Anchoring involves sliding a window of height h over rows to find where existing blocks' colors form a subsequence matching one signal color sequence; this anchors the pattern for extensions.
 * Placement extends blocks forward/backward from the anchor using steps (df=2h-1 forward, db=2h+1 backward), with fixed gaps between blocks; new blocks are placed only in bg cells, but overplacement or out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Subtleties: Assumes consistent h across blocks (inconsistent leads to no-op return); subsequence matching is loose (allows extra elements in signal); gaps are fixed from initial blocks; odd-column bias for tracks may miss even-column signals; 0/bg confusion in validation (e.g., "cell == 0 or cell == g[0][0] and g[0][0] == 0" is buggy); no rotation or vertical blocks considered; assumes square grid.
 * Edge cases: No tracks/signals/blocks result in unchanged grid; extension stops at grid edges; multiple signals per row/track not handled beyond collection; colors must be uniform per block vertically/horizontally.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for isolation.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):  # Odd columns only
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                if consec > max_consec:
                    max_consec = consec
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts signal tracks with isolated non-bg cells; helpful but assumes odd columns and single-cell isolation.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                signal_set.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))

def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(These collect signal positions and per-row color sequences from tracks; essential for pattern matching, but assumes one color per track per row.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(This finds horizontal block spans of same color >=2 wide; useful for detecting existing patterns, but collects across all rows without vertical consistency check.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence checker; key for matching block colors to signals, allows non-contiguous matches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt failed completely due to syntax errors (invalid code like stray "wait no..." comment in find_anchor at line ~88), preventing any execution or output generation.
 * What worked: Basic structure for extracting bg, tracks, signals, and blocks is logically sound and puzzle-aligned; subsequence matching and gap calculation capture core pattern extension ideas.
 * What didn't work: Syntax errors caused total failure (no outputs generated); find_anchor has incomplete/broken validation logic (e.g., unfinished bg checks, assumes uniform h without enforcement); placement logic (extend_ranges_for_placement, place_at) is overly rigid (fixed steps df/db, gap-based extension) and doesn't handle variable gaps, rotations, or non-odd tracks; no handling for multiple anchors or failed matches beyond no-op; assumes all blocks same height h, which may not hold; ignores even columns for tracks, potentially missing signals.
 * anchor finding (find_anchor) is broken/not helpful due to syntax and vague validation (e.g., skips bg cells incorrectly, doesn't enforce vertical uniformity properly); don't use in future without fixes.
 * get_gap and extend_ranges_for_placement are partially helpful for spacing but assume fixed gaps and forward-only extension, which may not fit puzzle symmetries.
 * Overall, the attempt shows partial understanding of signal/block detection but fails on integration and execution; training examples all errored identically, indicating no progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error due to syntax, so no grid is generated; this does not make sense or match any expected puzzle completion, as the program doesn't run to produce a modified grid.
 * Without valid execution, cannot verify if placements align with test input's patterns (e.g., expected block extensions or signal matches); the error prevents any comparison, confirming the output is incorrect and unhelpful.
 * To handle test cases, future attempts must fix syntax, add robust error handling for inconsistent h/gaps, and validate against expected symmetric placements (e.g., mirroring signals around anchor).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[tuple]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block placement where "small rows" (sparse patterned rows at specific odd indices like 1,3,5,7) serve as control instructions to replicate or extend "large layers" (dense block structures starting around row 8 or similar) into additional stacked or mirrored layers across the grid, using the background color (bg, e.g., 8, 1, or 3) to identify empty space and ensuring layers fit within grid bounds without overwriting existing content unless it's bg.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) varies per example (8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test) and must be dynamically detected (e.g., from g[0][0]); all non-bg cells are potential blocks or instructions.
 * Small rows are candidates at fixed odd indices (1,3,5,7) but only qualify if positions 1 and/or 3 are non-bg; these rows provide color cues for new layers (e.g., g[sr][1] as first color, g[sr][3] as second, g[sr][5] optionally as third if non-bg).
 * Large layers are identified in lower/middle grid sections (e.g., starting at min row with non-bg in cols 8+), consisting of horizontal blocks defined by start col, width, and color; spacing between blocks (e.g., from first to second block) must be preserved for alignment in new layers.
 * Layer placement logic depends on large layer position: if top-half (is_top = large_start < n//2), stack downward with spacing like 2*h or 2*h-1 (h=height of large layer); if bottom-half, stack upward with fixed d=2*h+1; always clip to [0, n-h] to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * New layers (for k=1 to t-1, where t=len(small_rows)) copy the large layer's structure (start cols, widths) but use small row colors; optionally add an extra block if has_col5 (g[sr][5] non-bg) at position after last block + spacing, with width assumed square (w=h).
 * Only overwrite bg cells in new layers to avoid corrupting existing content; if no small rows or no large blocks, output unchanged grid.
 * Subtle: Number of blocks p in large layer limits colors from small row (e.g., only use first p colors); assume square blocks if no widths (w=h); handle variable grid sizes (23x23 in trains, ~27x27 in test); potential for 0-4 small rows, leading to 0-3 added layers.
 * Easy to miss: Large layer height h is max-min row span of non-bg in cols 8+ (not full grid height); blocks in large layer skip bg cols; downward stacking may use varying deltas (e.g., 2h for full, 2h-1 for partial); extra block only if p>=1 and col5 non-bg; test has more cols (27), so large layer blocks extend further right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is reliable for non-destructive modification.)

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Accurately detects varying bg like 8,1,3 from top-left.)

```python
def get_small_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    candidates = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    n = len(g)
    return [r for r in candidates if r < n and g[r][1] != bg and g[r][3] != bg]
```
(Helpful for identifying control rows, but note it requires both col1 and col3 non-bg—may miss rows with only one; in train3, it would catch rows 1,3,5 with patterns like 2/3,3/3,3/4.)

```python
def has_col5(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, r: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    return 0 <= r < n and g[r][5] != bg
```
(Useful for detecting optional third block in small rows, e.g., triggers extra in train2 row5 with 3 at col5.)

```python
def find_large_layer(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, 0, []
    m = len(g[0])
    large_rs = [r for r in range(n) if any(c != bg for c in g[r][8:m])]
    if not large_rs:
        return 0, 0, []
    start_r = min(large_rs)
    h = max(large_rs) - start_r + 1
    blocks = []
    i = 8
    while i < m:
        if g[start_r][i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        colr = g[start_r][i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < m and g[start_r][j] == colr:
            j += 1
        w = j - i
        blocks.append((i, w, colr))
        i = j
    return start_r, h, blocks
```
(This correctly extracts the large layer's start row, height, and block list (start_col, width, color) from cols 8+ in the first non-empty row of the span; helpful for base structure, but assumes blocks only in start_r—may miss vertical variations; works for train1's 4-blocks at cols~8-16.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core placement logic is flawed despite detecting bg, small rows, and large layers.
 * Train1: Generated correctly placed initial small rows (1-3: left 4/1 patterns, middle 4's) and detected large layer (1's at rows7-9, cols8-16), but misplaced added layers—e.g., left 1's appear in row5 (unexpected, overwrites empty) instead of row5 empty/row6 middle 1's; bottom 1's duplicated at rows12-14 but shifted up one row from expected rows12-14 (expected has gap at row10-11); no extra block added, but p=2 so only two colors used correctly; unknown why left patterns in row5 but not aligned to expected.
 * Train2: Generated detected small rows (1:2/2? but shown as 2/2 wait, input not shown but output has row1:2's left, row3:1's left, row5:2's middle +3 left?); large layer partially captured (1's at rows8-9 cols10-16? but misplaced); added layers wrong—e.g., row7 has 1's left +3 but expected row7:1's left +1's middle no 3; row12-13 has 1's middle +3's right but expected row11-12:1's middle +3's right; extra 3's appear in row5/7/13/15 but expected only in specific spots like row5 col5, row11-12 cols16-17, row14-15 cols16-17; row4 has unexpected 2's middle; seems extra blocks added too often or wrong colors/spacing.
 * Train3: Bg=1 detected; small rows at 1(2/3),3(3/3),5(3/4); no large layer detected (since cols8+ all bg=1, so blocks=[] returns early, no additions); generated unchanged from input? But output shows left patterns in rows1,3,5,6? and bottom layers at rows15-17(3's),21-22(3/4) but expected has middle layers at rows10-11(2/3),15-17(3's),21-22(3/4); generated misses middle 2/3 entirely and places 3/4 too early/wrong; also row15-17 has 3's but shifted left/no 4's integrated; function find_large_layer broken here as no cols8+ non-bg, so skips all additions—unhelpful for cases without right-side large layer.
 * Overall: Layer stacking deltas wrong (e.g., is_top logic places downward but with incorrect 2h vs 2h-1, leading to overlaps/shifts); clipping helps but doesn't fix miscalculations; color assignment uses small row correctly but p limits it (good); extra block via has_col5 triggers but positioning (last + spacing) misaligns; w=h assumption okay but untested; program doesn't handle no-large-layer (just returns copy, but train3 needs additions? Wait, train3 expected has added bottom layers despite no large—major flaw).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it replicates some left small-row patterns (e.g., row1:1's at col1/3, row3:4's col1/3 +2 col5, row5:1/4/1 left, row6:1/4 left) and detects a large layer around rows10-13 (4's cols13-16, 2's cols18-21) and adds bottom layers at rows18-21 (4's +4's? +2's but colors wrong, expected likely 4's then 1's or per small), rows23-26 (1's cols13-16 +4's cols18-21 +1's cols24-27); but placements are shifted—e.g., row7 has unexpected 8 at col1 (bg=3, but 8!=3, possible overwrite error); row18-21 has 4's/2's but expected probably mirrored or color-swapped per small rows (e.g., using colors from row1/3/5 like 1,4,2); extra blocks added (e.g., row18-21 has extra 4's cols18-21 then 2's, but misaligned spacing); bottom rows23-26 have 1's/4's/1's but likely wrong colors (small row5 has 1/4/1? but p=2 for large? so extra via col5?); overall, similar to trains: left patterns kept but added layers misplaced vertically (gaps wrong, e.g., row14-17 all bg but expected may have more stacking), and right blocks not fully extended (27 cols suggest more blocks possible); doesn't match because training logic fails analogously—no large in trains3 but test has one, yet stacking buggy.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid completion where partial patterns (like colored blocks or evolving shapes) must be extended or filled vertically/horizontally based on detected motifs, such as uniform color blocks, single indicator cells, or evolving two-sided blocks with changing colors across "stages." The goal is to identify background color, locate key pattern starters (e.g., singles or blocks starting from column 7+), and replicate/extend them in predicted positions while preserving existing non-background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid; all fillings should only replace background cells, never overwrite existing non-background colors.
 * Patterns often start or are indicated by "singles": rows with exactly two non-background cells at specific positions (e.g., columns 1 and 3), which signal the color and row for extending a block elsewhere (e.g., in columns 7+).
 * Uniform blocks are vertical stacks (height >=2) of consistent non-background positions (at least 4 columns wide, starting from column 7) with a single color; these may need extension based on singles, using steps like 2*h -1 where h is block height, and potentially adding "extensions" (extra sub-blocks) if singles have extra non-background in column 5.
 * Evolution blocks are two adjacent sub-blocks (equal width >=2, separated by gap) with different left/right colors; they evolve by decrementing/incrementing the higher color toward the lower one across stages (e.g., if left=4, right=2, next stage left=3, right=2), placed in multiples of height h with gaps (e.g., 2*h or 3*h between stages); determine stage by available space above (if enough for full prior stages, fill backward; else fill forward/backward).
 * Sub-blocks are contiguous runs of non-background positions; gaps between sub-blocks matter for evolution (e.g., consistent gap size).
 * Vertical spacing: Patterns repeat every 2*h -1 or multiples of h + gaps (e.g., 2*h); ensure new placements don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Subtle: Color evolution prefers decrementing the higher side or incrementing the lower; equal colors may default to decrement left/increment right. Singles may indicate multiple instances (num_singles), with extensions only after the first one having column 5 non-background.
 * Overlaps or partial grids: Existing patterns shouldn't be overwritten; if a placement would conflict, skip or adjust (though not handled well in code). Grid size varies (23x23 in trains, 27x27? in test), so n=len(g).
 * Easy to miss: Block detection only scans from column 7+ (assuming left side is for indicators); inconsistent sub-block widths/gaps break detection; evolution assumes two sub-blocks only, fails on more/fewer.
 * All trains show partial detection (e.g., singles/blocks found) but incorrect placement (wrong rows, missing extensions, wrong colors); test likely similar.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test; essential for all fillings.)

```python
def find_singles(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    singles = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = g[i]
        nonb_pos = [j for j in range(n) if row[j] != b]
        if len(nonb_pos) == 2 and nonb_pos == [1, 3]:
            color = row[1]
            if row[3] == color:
                singles.append((i, color))
    return singles
```
(Partially helpful: Detects indicator rows with matching colors at cols 1/3; used in train1/2 to find starters like row3 color1, row5 color1; but misses if positions vary or more non-b exist; extendable for other indicator patterns.)

```python
def get_subblocks(pos: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not pos:
        return []
    pos = sorted(pos)
    sub = [pos[0]]
    subs = []
    for p in pos[1:]:
        if p == sub[-1] + 1:
            sub.append(p)
        else:
            subs.append(sub)
            sub = [p]
    subs.append(sub)
    return subs
```
(Helpful for splitting contiguous non-background runs, e.g., into left/right for evolution blocks; correctly identifies gaps, used in block detection.)

```python
def find_block(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[int], int] | None:
    # (code as provided; scans for vertical uniform blocks starting col7+, height>=2, single color, >=4 wide)
```
(Helpful in concept for uniform patterns like train1's 4-block at rows1-3 cols8-10/13-15; detects position/color but fails extension logic.)

```python
def find_evolution_block(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[int], List[int], int, int] | None:
    # (code as provided; scans for two equal-width sub-blocks with different colors, consistent vertically)
```
(Helpful for train2/3/test evolutions, e.g., train2 left1/right3 at rows7-8 cols10-12/16-17? Wait, positions vary; detects structure but evolution rules buggy: wrong stage detection, color changes, placements.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples incorrect; program detects background and some patterns (e.g., singles in train1 rows 1? Wait no, row3/5; blocks in train1 rows1-3) but fails to place extensions correctly (wrong rows, missing sub-blocks, no color adaptation).
 * Train1: Generated correctly keeps top block of 4's at rows1-3 cols8-10/13-15 and singles at rows1/3 cols1/3 (but row indices off?); what worked: detected uniform block and singles; what didn't: missed placing new 1-block at rows6-8 cols8-10/13-15 (expected has it, generated all background); also missed lower 1-block at rows11-13; singles extension logic broken (step=2*h-1=5, but placements skip or wrong start).
 * Train2: Generated places some singles (rows1 col1/3=2, row3=1, row5=2? partial, row7=1) and partial blocks (rows4-5 cols10-12/14-15=2, but expected has them; row7-8 cols10-12/14-15=1); what worked: partial evolution detection (left/right split); what didn't: missed full stage3 at rows10-12 cols10-12/14-15=1 and cols16-17=3; placements only partial, no forward extension; color evolution wrong (didn't increment to 3 on right).
 * Train3: Background=1 detected; generated places some left-side singles (rows1 col1/3=2/3? partial, row3=3, row5=3/4) and lower blocks (rows10-11 cols11-12=2 cols16-17=3, rows14-15 cols11-12/16-17=3); what worked: detected some vertical patterns; what didn't: missed upper evolutions (e.g., no row20-21 cols11-12=3 cols16-17=4); placements inconsistent (e.g., row15 has 3's but expected all1; row10-11 has 2/3 but expected same; no decrement logic for colors 2->1 or 3->2); singles not used for extensions.
 * Overall: uniform_block path triggers in train1 but extension loop buggy (new_start calc wrong, has_ext never triggers properly, new_sub placement off); evo_block in train2/3 but stage detection flawed (assumes fixed distances like 3*h or 2*h, wrong color rules e.g., always -1 higher even if equal); no handling for multiple blocks or overlaps; find_block assumes single color from first row only, breaks if varies slightly; find_evolution_block requires exact two subs, fails if more (e.g., train1 has two but gapped); get_subblocks good but underused.
 * Function find_singles is helpful but too rigid (only cols1/3, len==2); find_block partially works for uniforms but loop breaks early on len<4; find_evolution_block detects structure but consistency check too strict (requires all non-b only in left+right, misses if extras); program(g) copies grid but only fills if block found, else evo, but no fallback for neither.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The ext_dict in uniform path (uses col5, but train1 has no col5 non-b, so first_ext_k stays num, has_ext never true, no extensions added); evolution color logic arbitrary (e.g., if cl>cr: s2l=cl-1 s2r=cr, but train2 needs increment on lower side); gap2=2*h hardcoded, but trains vary (train2 gap~2 rows between stages?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it partially fills some patterns but misses key extensions and has wrong placements/colors, similar to trains.
 * What was generated: Upper left singles at row0 cols1/3=1, row3 cols1/3/5=4/2? (row3 has col5=2, but expected unknown); block at rows2-5 cols18-21=2 (4-wide uniform); lower block at rows10-13 cols13-16=4; very bottom rows22-25 cols13-16=4 but cols18-21=3 (partial evolution?); row7 has col1=8 (outlier).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from pattern/rules, since no expected given): Likely misses evolution of the 2-block (rows2-5 cols18-21=2) to next stage (e.g., if single-side, extend down with color+1=3 at similar pos, height h=4, step~7, around row12-15 but generated has 4's there instead); upper row6 cols5=1 not extended; bottom 4-block should evolve to 5 or split left/right but stays 4 and adds wrong 3's in cols18-21; left singles (1/4) not used to place blocks in cols7+ (e.g., no 1-block or 4-evolution); background=3 preserved but fillings overwrite minimally, missing multiple stages (e.g., if evo from row2, prior stage above row0 impossible, so add below at row2+h+gap~row9-12 with evolved colors, but generated skips); overall, detects some blocks but wrong evolution (no color change to 3/5), wrong positions (cols13-16=4 unrelated to upper 18-21=2), and no full grid completion (many rows all-background, expected more patterns).
 * Does not make sense: Partial fillings suggest detection works (e.g., uniform 2-block, 4-block) but extension/evo rules fail (hardcoded distances wrong for 27x27, color logic doesn't match trains' decrement/increment); looks like uniform path triggered wrongly instead of evo, leading to static copies rather than evolving.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

(Helpful: Gets lowest foreground color for default additions.)

    # (Full flood-fill based detection of filled rectangular components >1 cell)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'y1', 'y2', 'x1', 'x2', 'color', 'h', 'w'
```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

```python

    if not blocks:
        return False, 0
    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step
        if p1 >= 0:
            added.append(p1)
            p2 = y1 - 2 * step
            if p2 >= 0:
                added.append(p2)
    return added
```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

```python
def add_rectangle(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], py: int, x1: int, x2: int, color: int, h: int, n: int):
    for i in range(h):
        yy = py + i
        if 0 <= yy < n:
            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:23:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or signals on a background, where the task is to detect sparse "signals" in vertical tracks and use them to identify and extend uniform colored block patterns across the grid, anchoring from an existing block structure and propagating it to match signal sequences in other rows. The goal is to fill in missing blocks while preserving existing content and ensuring blocks are uniform rectangles that align with signal colors as subsequences.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color, often 3 in examples; all uniform rows help confirm it, but fall back to top-left if no full uniform row.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals—defined as having at least one non-bg cell, but crucially only those where non-bg cells are isolated (max consecutive non-bg == 1, no clumps).
 * Signals are rows with non-bg cells in tracks; collect unique such rows, sort them, and extract non-bg colors from tracks in those rows (excluding 8, which may be a special/noise value).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ consecutive identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start, end) ranges across the grid.
 * Anchor detection: Search for a rectangular block structure (height h >=2, starting at row s) where blocks are uniform color across height, all blocks same width w, positions match a sorted list of block ranges, and the sequence of block colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors.
 * Extension: Once anchored, propagate to other signal rows by calculating row positions with forward/backward steps (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward), extending block ranges rightward if needed (with fixed gap between blocks), and placing only on bg cells.
 * Fallback if no anchor: Use default h=2, w=2, start blocks at center, step backward from bottom, extend ranges, place blocks— but this seems less precise and may overlap or misalign.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., blocks match a subset); only place on bg to avoid overwriting; ensure extended ranges don't exceed grid size; gap between blocks is derived from anchor (end1 +1 + gap = start2); signals may have varying numbers of colors, so extend blocks to match; isolated signals (max_consec=1) define tracks, but blocks can be wider; 8 is ignored in signal colors, possibly a delimiter or invalid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no signals returns copy; anchor search starts from larger h downward, left-to-right s; if multiple anchors possible, takes first found; propagation skips invalid positions (out of bounds); in fallback, starts from bottom and steps up (negative direction).
 * All existing non-bg must be preserved unless overwritten logically, but code only overwrites bg; block colors must exactly match signal colors in order.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchor-based propagation.
 * Anchor finding with subsequence matching worked well for trainings, allowing flexible pattern extension without requiring exact sequence matches.
 * Fallback logic (default blocks from bottom) was not triggered in trainings (since anchors found), but ensures something is placed if no anchor.
 * get_tracks enforces isolated signals (max_consec=1), which is crucial and worked; without it, clumped columns might be misidentified.
 * place_blocks only overwrites bg, preserving existing non-bg, which is correct and prevented overwriting in trainings.
 * extend_block_ranges correctly adds blocks rightward with fixed gap and width, handling varying signal lengths.
 * No major misses in trainings, but search for anchor starts from larger h downward and left s, which may prefer certain patterns; step calculations (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) seem empirically tuned for spacing between signal rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows placements in rows 10-13 (4-wide blocks of 4 at cols 13-16, 2 at 18-21), rows 17-20 (4-wide 1 at 13-16, 4 at 18-21, 1 at 23-26), and scattered signals in upper rows (e.g., row1: 1s at cols1,3,13-16,18-21,23-26; row3 similar), with some existing patterns like row3 cols13-16=1s preserved/modified minimally.
 * It looks partially correct: blocks are uniform rectangles matching apparent signal colors (e.g., 4s and 2s in lower, 1s and 4s in mid-lower), placed on bg=3 without overwriting, and aligned to even-ish columns suggesting track influence; spacing/gaps seem consistent (e.g., gap=1 between block groups).
 * However, upper signals (rows 1-5) have placements like isolated 1/4/2 in even cols (0,2,5?), but code targets odd tracks— this may be existing input not extended, or fallback/misplacement; row6 has 1/4/1 but no block extension visible, suggesting propagation skipped invalid positions.
 * Lower blocks (rows10-13,17-20) match multi-color signals (e.g., [4,2] subsequence for row10+), but row14-16 are all bg—no placement, possibly no matching signal or out-of-bounds; overall, it makes sense as an extension but may miss forward propagation from anchor (if anchor in upper/mid) or undetect some tracks (e.g., col5 has signals but no blocks there).
 * Existing input has vertical alignments (e.g., cols13-16 have 1s in rows2-5, then 4s lower), and output extends horizontally into blocks, which aligns with rules; no obvious errors like overwriting non-bg or mismatched colors, but subtle issue: signal rows include row7? (all bg, skipped correctly), and 8 in row7 col1 ignored properly.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 09:23:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 09:46:03] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]

def get_left_cols(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3]
    if any(g[r][5] != bg for r in range(len(g))):
        left_cols.append(5)
    return left_cols

def get_sample_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, left_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(g)
    first_r = min((r for r in range(n) if any(g[r][c] != bg for c in left_cols)), default=0)
    sample_rows = []
    r = first_r
    while r < n:
        if any(g[r][c] != bg for c in left_cols):
            sample_rows.append(r)
            r += 2
        else:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 09:46:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids where a background color dominates, with palettes defined in specific left-side columns and sample rows, used to fill in missing or patterned blocks (substructures) in the right half of the grid based on matching color sequences and positional rules for blocks of fixed size 's'. The goal is to output a completed grid by replicating palette colors into detected block positions, handling variations like extra columns or special matching cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is typically the most common or top-left value, but must be propagated correctly to all functions to avoid undefined variable errors.
 * Left columns (e.g., 1,3, possibly 5) hold palette info; detect if column 5 is active based on non-bg values in that column across rows.
 * Sample rows are every other row starting from the first non-empty left-column row, used to build the palette (k rows x m columns of colors).
 * Blocks on the right start at row b_start with height s (consecutive rows with non-bg in right half); sub_starts detect horizontal block positions in the first block row by runs of non-bg colors of length exactly s.
 * Palette matching (find_j) identifies which palette row 'j' matches the sub_colors sequence from the first block; includes a special case for m=2, len_left=3 where partial matches (e.g., first two colors same, skipping middle) are allowed if the third left color is non-bg.
 * Filling propagates non-j palettes to other block positions: forward steps use 2*s -1 spacing (or adjusted if first sample is row 0), backward uses 2*s +1; for extra left column (len_left=3), fill an additional block after the second sub with separator=1.
 * Subtleties: Block detection stops at first empty right-half row; fallback j=0 if no match; skip invalid b_s positions (out of bounds); only fill non-bg palette colors; m = number of sub-blocks per row; ensure row_out is a copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Easy to miss: Variable scoping (e.g., bg not passed to find_j); special matching logic for 3-left-columns case; step_sum calculations differ if first_sample_zero; width exactly == s for sub detection; filling loops must check column bounds.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]  # Simple top-left bg detection; works if bg is consistent.
```

```python
def get_left_cols(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    left_cols = [1, 3]
    if any(g[r][5] != bg for r in range(len(g))):
        left_cols.append(5)
    return left_cols  # Detects active palette columns; useful for variable-width palettes.
```

```python
def get_sample_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, left_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    n = len(g)
    first_r = min((r for r in range(n) if any(g[r][c] != bg for c in left_cols)), default=0)
    sample_rows = []
    r = first_r
    while r < n:
        if any(g[r][c] != bg for c in left_cols):
            sample_rows.append(r)
            r += 2
        else:
            break
    return sample_rows  # Extracts every-other-row samples starting from first non-empty; key for palette building.
```

```python
def get_palette(g: List[List[int]], sample_rows: List[int], left_cols: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[g[r][c] for c in left_cols] for r in sample_rows]  # Builds palette matrix; essential for color matching.
```

```python
def get_b_start_and_s(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> tuple:
    n = len(g)
    has_non_right = [any(c != bg for c in row[n // 2:]) for row in g]
    b_start = 0
    s = 0
    current_start = 0
    for r in range(n):
        if has_non_right[r]:
            if s == 0:
                b_start = r
                current_start = r
            s = r - current_start + 1
        else:
            if s > 0:
                break
            s = 0
            current_start = r + 1
    if s == 0:
        b_start = current_start
    return b_start, s  # Detects block start row and height; critical for positioning, but fragile if no blocks (s=0 fallback).
```

```python
def get_sub_starts(g: List[List[int]], b_start: int, s: int, bg: int) -> List[int]:
    n = len(g[0])
    row = g[b_start]
    sub_starts = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            color = row[i]
            width = 0
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                width += 1
                i += 1
            if width == s:
                sub_starts.append(start)
        else:
            i += 1
    return sub_starts  # Finds horizontal block starts by exact-width runs; good for multi-sub-block rows.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (this single submission) failed due to execution errors: "name 'bg' is not defined" in find_j function, caused by missing parameter passing (bg used but not received); this prevented any grid processing or output generation.
 * What worked: Core structure detection (bg, left_cols, sample_rows, palette, b_start/s, sub_starts) seems logically sound based on puzzle patterns, with special cases for 3-column palettes and partial matching; filling logic attempts correct replication with spacing rules.
 * What didn't work: Variable scoping error halted execution entirely; no outputs generated, so unable to verify filling accuracy; special find_j matching (e.g., for m=2, len_left=3) references undefined bg, breaking palette index selection; step_sum calculations untested but potentially off if first_sample_zero mishandled; no handling for edge cases like s=0 or no matches (fallback j=0 may be wrong).
 * find_j function is broken due to missing bg param and complex logic that may overfit (special case for partial matches might miss true mismatches); still potentially helpful if fixed and simplified.
 * get_b_start_and_s is helpful but subtle bug: resets s=0 incorrectly on empty rows after blocks, and fallback b_start=current_start if s=0 may point to invalid area.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of palette/block mechanics but no successful runs; untested elements like d_forward/backward spacing and extra-column filling can't be validated.

**Test output:**
 * No actual grid outputs generated in any attempt due to execution errors; all results are "ERROR - Execution error: name 'bg' is not defined", which does not make sense or match expected completed grid (test input should produce a filled version with palettes replicated into right-side blocks per spacing rules).
 * Outputs are identical across training examples 1-3 and test (all errors), indicating a systemic scoping issue rather than input-specific failure; expected test output should show filled blocks (e.g., color sequences from non-j palettes copied to calculated b_s positions, with possible extra fills for column 5), but errors prevent comparison—likely incorrect as no filling occurs.
 * To handle test case, must fix bg passing (e.g., add bg param to find_j) and ensure out grid copies input correctly before modifications; test may involve first_sample_zero=True or len_left=3, requiring special step_sum and extra-block logic.

[2025-10-03 09:46:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:06:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of integers (colors/pixels) where the goal is to detect a background color, identify "key" rows and columns with non-background indicators, extract a small key pattern from their intersections, determine a block scale from run lengths, and then "reveal" or fill a larger logo pattern by placing scaled blocks of colors from the key matrix into the grid at aligned positions, overwriting background cells while preserving existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (B) is the most common color in the flattened grid; everything else is a signal or part of the pattern.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (starting from 1, up to min(10, n)) that contain at least one non-B cell in the top min(8, n) rows— this acts as vertical "keys" or anchors for the pattern.
 * Key rows are those (up to top 8) that have at least one non-B in the key columns; the key matrix is extracted solely from intersections of key rows and key columns, forming an m x k color grid (often small, like 3x3).
 * Scale (s) is the maximum horizontal run of consecutive identical non-B cells in any row, used as the width (and sometimes height proxy) for logo blocks.
 * Block starts are horizontal positions where full s-length runs of non-B start across multiple rows; spacing between blocks is derived from differences in these starts (s + empty gaps).
 * Vertical placement: Align blocks to key rows' positions, but shift based on a "filled" index (matching key colors to existing blocks) and spacing; height (h) is derived from the vertical span of the first detected block.
 * Subtlety: Only fill background (B) cells; do not overwrite existing non-B cells. Protection rules skip filling in top/bottom borders if s==2 and B==8 (likely to avoid UI elements or frames).
 * Subtlety: If multiple block starts, use their differences for empty spacing; default to 1 if only one. Block starts may truncate if they exceed grid width.
 * Subtlety: "i_filled" is the highest key row index matching an existing block's color, used to anchor vertical shifts; r_starts are offset from the filled block's row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction is limited to top 8 rows/10 cols, even if grid is larger (e.g., 23x23 in examples); patterns may have side indicators (like vertical stripes in cols 1,3) that are not part of the main logo.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must be solid (all cells in the h x s rectangle match the color) in existing grid to validate; invalid blocks are skipped.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal block detection skips over B runs and only considers non-B runs of at least s.
 * Considerations: Grids can be 23x23 (training) or 27x27 (test); colors vary (1-8, B=8 or 3); patterns may have irregular heights or partial fills; multiple blocks per row/column.
 * All attempts assume logo is placed in a grid-aligned, spaced manner, but fail on vertical alignment or skipping invalid placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies B, used in all attempts and works across examples.)

```python
def get_key_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    key_cols = []
    for c in range(1, min(10, n), 2):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for r in range(min(8, n))):
            key_cols.append(c)
    return key_cols
```
(This identifies odd-indexed key columns with signals in top rows; helpful for anchoring, works in train3.)

```python
def get_key_rows(g: List[List[int]], B: int, key_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rows = set()
    for r in range(min(8, len(g))):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for c in key_cols):
            rows.add(r)
    return sorted(rows)
```
(This finds key rows based on key cols; essential for extracting the key matrix, accurate in examples.)

```python
def get_key_colors(g: List[List[int]], key_rows: List[int], key_cols: List[int], B: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    m = len(key_rows)
    k = len(key_cols)
    kc = [[B] * k for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        r = key_rows[i]
        for j in range(k):
            kc[i][j] = g[r][key_cols[j]]
    return kc
```
(This extracts the m x k key pattern; core to getting colors for filling, works but ignores B in key if present.)

```python
def get_scale(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> int:
    max_s = 1
    for row in g:
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == B:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_color = row[i]
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == start_color:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if length > max_s:
                max_s = length
            i = j
    return max_s
```
(This finds max non-B run length for block width s; helpful, but may overfit if runs vary; works for train3.)

```python
def get_main_start_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = set()
    for r in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i <= n - s:
            if all(g[r][c] == g[r][i] != B for c in range(i, i + s)):
                starts.add(i)
            j = i
            while j < n and g[r][j] == g[r][i]:
                j += 1
            i = j
    return sorted(list(starts))
```
(This detects horizontal start positions for s-length non-B runs; useful for horizontal spacing, but buggy as it adds starts even if not full blocks vertically.)

```python
def get_block_info(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, start_c: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    present_rows = []
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == g[r][start_c] != B for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            present_rows.append(r)
    if not present_rows:
        return None
    min_r = min(present_rows)
    max_r = max(present_rows)
    color = g[min_r][start_c]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        if not all(g[r][c] == color for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            return None
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    return (min_r, h, color)
```
(This validates vertical blocks at a start col, returning position, height, color if solid; helpful for detecting existing filled blocks, key to anchoring.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects B, key rows/cols, and key colors in all cases, as seen in partial matches.
 * Worked well for train3 (fully correct), indicating core logic for spacing, scaling, and filling aligns sometimes when patterns are simple/aligned.
 * Failed train1: Generated extra 4's in row1 cols18-20 (not in expected, which has empty there); placed 1's in rows16-18 cols8-10 but expected has them empty (only side indicators); missed aligning lower 1's blocks to match expected positions in rows11-13 and16-18; overfilled some areas ignoring protection.
 * Failed train2: Missed placing 1's block in rows7-8 cols10-14 (expected has it, but generated only has side 1's and 3's); duplicated 3's in rows10-13 cols16-17 but expected has them only lower; failed to shift vertical placements correctly for middle rows; extra empty rows unfilled.
 * get_main_start_cols is helpful but buggy—adds starts per row without requiring vertical consistency, leading to incorrect spacing (e.g., assumes too many starts in train1/2).
 * get_block_info is essential and mostly correct, but skips invalid blocks; in train1/2, it under-detects filled blocks, causing wrong i_filled (defaults to 0, misaligning r_starts).
 * Protection logic (skip top/bottom if s==2 and B==8) is unhelpful/broken for train1 (B=8, s likely 3, but still overfills borders); not triggered in train2 (B=8? wait, train2 seems B=8, but no protection applied correctly).
 * Vertical shifting via i_filled and r_starts works in train3 but fails in train1/2 due to poor matching of key colors to blocks (uses max possible_i, but misses color consistency across h).
 * Horizontal block_starts truncate correctly but spacing (s + empty) assumes uniform gaps; in train1, diff-based empty=1? leads to overlaps/misplacements.
 * Overall, attempt understands extraction and scaling but mishandles vertical alignment and validation, causing partial/overfills in complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies B=3, extracts keys (e.g., fills 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16,20-23 matching input hints), places scaled blocks (s likely 4, seen in 4x4 fills of 1,4,2), and uses spacing ~4+3=7 (e.g., blocks at cols13-16,20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overwrites/adds 8's in rows20-23 cols13-16 (input has empty 3's, but 8 may be invalid color for this grid—B=3, 8 seems out of place); misses filling some hinted areas like row3 col5=2 (remains isolated, not expanded to block); row5 col3=4 not expanded vertically/horizontally to match key; extra 1's in row5 col13-16 but input already has them, and it doesn't align all key rows (e.g., lower keys in rows15-18,20-23 partially filled but shifted wrong, adding 1's in row19? wait, row15-18 has 1's and 4's but expected likely needs consistent h=4 blocks); side indicators (cols1,3,5) preserved but logo blocks seem misaligned vertically (e.g., row20-23 8's block doesn't match any key color pattern).
 * Fills bottom rows20-23 with 8's block, but input has no such hint there—likely wrong color from key mismatch or invalid extraction; upper rows0-3 side fills (1,4,2) not blocked properly.
 * To handle test: Need better block validation (require full h consistency before filling), correct i_filled to min/max instead of max, and ignore/exclude B=3 in key_colors properly; spacing may need vertical detection too.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 10:06:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists of integers representing visual elements like shapes, objects, or patterns), where the goal is to generate a Python program containing a specific 'program' function that processes training examples and a test input to produce correct outputs, possibly extracting or classifying objects based on puzzle rules. The previous attempt failed entirely due to a structural issue in the generated code, preventing any evaluation of puzzle-solving logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The generated code must include a top-level 'program' function, as its absence causes immediate validation errors across all examples; this is a core structural requirement, not related to puzzle logic.
 * Puzzle likely involves analyzing grid patterns for objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, or connected components), with rules for extraction, counting features like holes or connections, and matching against expected outputs—subtleties may include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, dividers, or incomplete spans across the grid.
 * Training examples are provided to infer rules (e.g., what constitutes a valid object or transformation), and the test input must be processed similarly without overfitting; subtle elements include omitting invalid objects (e.g., those not matching criteria like hole count) and ensuring outputs exactly match expected formats.
 * Considerations across attempts: No puzzle logic was tested due to errors, but future attempts should include functions for grid parsing (e.g., flood-fill for connected components) and validation against training data; watch for mismatches in blob shapes, object omission, or grid boundaries that could alter connectivity.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must be deterministic and exact (no approximations); grids may have noise or separators that need filtering.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were generated in the previous attempt, as the code lacked the required 'program' function and any puzzle-specific logic. Future attempts should include grid-processing utilities like those below for object extraction.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful type for puzzle elements (not from previous attempt)
class PuzzleObject:
    def __init__(self, positions, hole_count=0):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row, col) tuples
        self.hole_count = hole_count
```

```python
# Example of a helpful extraction function (not from previous attempt, but recommended for future use)
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[PuzzleObject]:
    # Use flood-fill or DFS to find connected components/objects in the grid
    visited = [[False for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]
    objects = []
    for i in range(len(grid)):
        for j in range(len(grid[0])):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:  # Assuming non-zero cells are part of objects
                component = []  # Collect positions
                # Implement DFS or BFS here to trace connected cells
                # Count holes if needed (e.g., enclosed zeros)
                hole_count = 0  # Placeholder: implement hole detection
                objects.append(PuzzleObject(component, hole_count))
    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The generated code completely omitted the required 'program' function, leading to errors in all training examples and the test input—no puzzle logic was executed or evaluated.
 * No object extraction or grid processing was possible, so issues like blob shape mismatches, object omission (e.g., based on hole count or validity), or handling dividers/separators could not be assessed.
 * No helpful functions were provided; any future code without 'program' is structurally broken and irrelevant to the puzzle.
 * Training examples 1-3 all failed identically due to the missing function, indicating a total lack of adherence to code format requirements—subtle puzzle rules (e.g., connectivity in grids) remain untested.
 * The attempt demonstrated no understanding of the puzzle, as even basic validation failed for unknown reasons related to code generation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct, as it indicates invalid code rather than a puzzle solution (e.g., no processed grid output, object list, or classification).
 * It is different from expected because a valid test output should apply inferred puzzle rules to the test grid (e.g., extracting and describing objects like shapes with holes), but nothing was generated—likely missing key elements like object positions, counts, or matches to training patterns.
 * This error prevents checking if the test handles subtleties like unique grid configurations (e.g., non-spanning keys or irregular objects), confirming the output is entirely incorrect and unhelpful.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with 0 likely as a special case or background) where the goal is to detect and extend patterns of horizontal blocks and vertical "tracks" (likely signal columns) to place additional colored blocks in empty spaces, following rules for anchoring, gaps, and subsequence matching to complete a symmetric or patterned output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) must be correctly identified as the uniform row color or default to top-left; it's crucial for distinguishing signals and blocks from empty space, but the code mishandles cases where bg is 0.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (odd indices) with exactly one non-bg cell per column to qualify as signals; multiple consecutive non-bg cells disqualify them, enforcing isolated signal points.
 * Signal rows are those containing any non-bg cell in a track; colors in these rows (per track) form sequences that must match block color patterns via subsequence checking.
 * Horizontal blocks are consecutive non-bg cells of the same color in rows, but only those of length >=2 are considered; all blocks must have consistent height h (vertical span), or the puzzle fails validation.
 * Anchoring involves sliding a window of height h over rows to find where existing blocks' colors form a subsequence matching one signal color sequence; this anchors the pattern for extensions.
 * Placement extends blocks forward/backward from the anchor using steps (df=2h-1 forward, db=2h+1 backward), with fixed gaps between blocks; new blocks are placed only in bg cells, but overplacement or out-of-bounds is ignored.
 * Subtleties: Assumes consistent h across blocks (inconsistent leads to no-op return); subsequence matching is loose (allows extra elements in signal); gaps are fixed from initial blocks; odd-column bias for tracks may miss even-column signals; 0/bg confusion in validation (e.g., "cell == 0 or cell == g[0][0] and g[0][0] == 0" is buggy); no rotation or vertical blocks considered; assumes square grid.
 * Edge cases: No tracks/signals/blocks result in unchanged grid; extension stops at grid edges; multiple signals per row/track not handled beyond collection; colors must be uniform per block vertically/horizontally.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for isolation.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):  # Odd columns only
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                if consec > max_consec:
                    max_consec = consec
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts signal tracks with isolated non-bg cells; helpful but assumes odd columns and single-cell isolation.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                signal_set.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))

def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(These collect signal positions and per-row color sequences from tracks; essential for pattern matching, but assumes one color per track per row.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    size = len(g)
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(This finds horizontal block spans of same color >=2 wide; useful for detecting existing patterns, but collects across all rows without vertical consistency check.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence checker; key for matching block colors to signals, allows non-contiguous matches.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt failed completely due to syntax errors (invalid code like stray "wait no..." comment in find_anchor at line ~88), preventing any execution or output generation.
 * What worked: Basic structure for extracting bg, tracks, signals, and blocks is logically sound and puzzle-aligned; subsequence matching and gap calculation capture core pattern extension ideas.
 * What didn't work: Syntax errors caused total failure (no outputs generated); find_anchor has incomplete/broken validation logic (e.g., unfinished bg checks, assumes uniform h without enforcement); placement logic (extend_ranges_for_placement, place_at) is overly rigid (fixed steps df/db, gap-based extension) and doesn't handle variable gaps, rotations, or non-odd tracks; no handling for multiple anchors or failed matches beyond no-op; assumes all blocks same height h, which may not hold; ignores even columns for tracks, potentially missing signals.
 * anchor finding (find_anchor) is broken/not helpful due to syntax and vague validation (e.g., skips bg cells incorrectly, doesn't enforce vertical uniformity properly); don't use in future without fixes.
 * get_gap and extend_ranges_for_placement are partially helpful for spacing but assume fixed gaps and forward-only extension, which may not fit puzzle symmetries.
 * Overall, the attempt shows partial understanding of signal/block detection but fails on integration and execution; training examples all errored identically, indicating no progress.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error due to syntax, so no grid is generated; this does not make sense or match any expected puzzle completion, as the program doesn't run to produce a modified grid.
 * Without valid execution, cannot verify if placements align with test input's patterns (e.g., expected block extensions or signal matches); the error prevents any comparison, confirming the output is incorrect and unhelpful.
 * To handle test cases, future attempts must fix syntax, add robust error handling for inconsistent h/gaps, and validate against expected symmetric placements (e.g., mirroring signals around anchor).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid where a background color is identified, signals in specific "tracks" (likely vertical columns) indicate rows that define frame patterns, and horizontal blocks of consecutive non-background cells represent frame elements to be placed or extended across the grid in a structured way, possibly reconstructing missing frames in a sequence. The goal is to output a modified grid with these frames filled based on signal cues and block patterns, handling multiple frames separated by consistent spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is a uniform color in full rows; if none, default to top-left cell—easy to miss partial backgrounds or grids without full uniform rows.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) with non-background signals, but only qualify if they have isolated single signals (not consecutive >=2), suggesting tracks carry discrete frame indicators rather than continuous elements.
 * Signal rows are any rows with non-background cells in valid tracks, implying these rows encode the color/pattern for frames.
 * Block ranges are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-background cells in any row, assumed to define the width and position of frame "bars" or fills; all blocks seem to share the same width, but positions may vary—subtlety is detecting only qualifying blocks and assuming uniform height for placement.
 * Frame placement involves finding a "filled" reference frame (where a block-width segment matches signal colors), then extrapolating forward/backward with steps like 2*h-1 (forward) or 2*h+1 (backward), where h is block width; this assumes arithmetic progression in positioning, but initial offsets depend on signal spacing (d = signal_row[1] - signal_row[0]).
 * Multiple frames (n = len(signal_rows)) are placed sequentially, but only after the filled frame; backward placement starts from a computed prior position—easy to miss edge cases like n=1 (default to first), no blocks (return original), or out-of-bounds starts.
 * Output is a copy of input with placed frames overlaid using signal colors; subtlety is that placement uses signal row colors for entire blocks, but only if non-background, and skips if start + h > grid size.
 * General: Grid is square (size x size); assumes even spacing and uniform block widths; potential issues with varying block positions per row or non-uniform colors across frames.
 * Across attempts: No successful runs, so untested on variations like no signals, all-background grids, or irregular spacing; consider validating assumptions like fixed step sizes against examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies uniform row background or defaults sensibly; useful for initialization.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, min(8, size), 2):
        has_signal = False
        consecutive = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != background:
                has_signal = True
                consecutive += 1
                if consecutive >= 2:
                    break
            else:
                consecutive = 0
        if has_signal and consecutive < 2:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(This extracts odd columns up to 8 with exactly one isolated signal; helpful for identifying cue columns, but cap at 8 may be puzzle-specific and limit larger grids.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], background: int) -> List[int]:
    size = len(g)
    signal_rows = set()
    for i in range(size):
        for j in tracks:
            if g[i][j] != background:
                signal_rows.add(i)
                break
    return sorted(list(signal_rows))
```
(This finds rows with signals in tracks; essential for frame indexing, assumes one signal per row max.)

    size = len(g)
    ranges = set()

        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == background:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges))
```
(This collects all horizontal runs >=2 of same color; useful for detecting frame block positions, but uses set so dedupes identical ranges across rows—may need per-row if positions vary.)

```python
def get_block_width(block_ranges: List[tuple]) -> int:
    if not block_ranges:
        return 0
    return block_ranges[0][1] - block_ranges[0][0] + 1
```
(Assumes uniform width from first range; simple but critical for h, fails if widths vary.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt provided a structured approach to parsing background, tracks, signals, and blocks, then placing frames via extrapolation from a reference—shows core understanding of component extraction and sequential placement logic.
 * What worked: Functions like get_background, get_tracks, get_signal_rows, and get_block_ranges correctly identify key grid elements (e.g., uniform background, isolated signals in odd columns, horizontal blocks), providing a solid foundation for puzzle decomposition.
 * What didn't work: Syntax error on line 122 (likely in place_frame referencing undefined 'g' or incomplete code in program function, e.g., "the filled start" is pseudocode-like and invalid), causing all executions (training 1-3 and test) to fail with "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 122)"—no outputs generated at all.
 * Placement logic in get_filled_frame and place_frame is conceptually sound (scans for matching filled segments, uses signal colors for fills) but buggy: get_filled_frame defaults to 1 if no match (may skip valid cases), place_frame references undefined 'g' (should pass g as param), and program has incomplete lines like "current_start = the filled start - step_before" (syntax/incomplete) and "g[0][0] # dummy" (not used properly).
 * Step calculations (d from signal spacing, step_after=2*h-1, step_before=2*h+1) seem derived from pattern observation but untested; initial_after computation assumes signals define offsets correctly, but may misalign if spacing irregular.
 * No handling for empty cases (e.g., no tracks/signals returns original—good), but overall, the attempt demonstrates partial puzzle grasp (element extraction) but fails execution, so no validation of placement accuracy.
 * get_filled_frame scans vertically for h-height filled blocks matching signal colors per track/block pair—helpful idea, but nested loops inefficient and assumes exact color matches per frame.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The program function's backward placement block is incomplete ("current_start = g[0][0]  # dummy" and "the filled start"), making it unusable; avoid direct use without fixing references to g and computing actual filled start position.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an ERROR due to syntax failure, so no grid is generated—completely invalid and does not match any expected puzzle solution.
 * Without execution, cannot assess if the logic would produce correct fills (e.g., placing colored blocks at computed positions matching signal cues); however, given the bugs, it likely wouldn't align frames properly even if syntax-fixed (e.g., unknown if step sizes handle test spacing, or if block matching finds the right reference frame).
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with extrapolated frames (e.g., extending visible patterns backward/forward using signal colors), but since nothing runs, it's missing all elements—prioritize syntax fixes and test on simple cases to verify placement.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based block placement where "small rows" (sparse patterned rows at specific odd indices like 1,3,5,7) serve as control instructions to replicate or extend "large layers" (dense block structures starting around row 8 or similar) into additional stacked or mirrored layers across the grid, using the background color (bg, e.g., 8, 1, or 3) to identify empty space and ensuring layers fit within grid bounds without overwriting existing content unless it's bg.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) varies per example (8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test) and must be dynamically detected (e.g., from g[0][0]); all non-bg cells are potential blocks or instructions.
 * Small rows are candidates at fixed odd indices (1,3,5,7) but only qualify if positions 1 and/or 3 are non-bg; these rows provide color cues for new layers (e.g., g[sr][1] as first color, g[sr][3] as second, g[sr][5] optionally as third if non-bg).
 * Large layers are identified in lower/middle grid sections (e.g., starting at min row with non-bg in cols 8+), consisting of horizontal blocks defined by start col, width, and color; spacing between blocks (e.g., from first to second block) must be preserved for alignment in new layers.
 * Layer placement logic depends on large layer position: if top-half (is_top = large_start < n//2), stack downward with spacing like 2*h or 2*h-1 (h=height of large layer); if bottom-half, stack upward with fixed d=2*h+1; always clip to [0, n-h] to avoid out-of-bounds.
 * New layers (for k=1 to t-1, where t=len(small_rows)) copy the large layer's structure (start cols, widths) but use small row colors; optionally add an extra block if has_col5 (g[sr][5] non-bg) at position after last block + spacing, with width assumed square (w=h).
 * Only overwrite bg cells in new layers to avoid corrupting existing content; if no small rows or no large blocks, output unchanged grid.
 * Subtle: Number of blocks p in large layer limits colors from small row (e.g., only use first p colors); assume square blocks if no widths (w=h); handle variable grid sizes (23x23 in trains, ~27x27 in test); potential for 0-4 small rows, leading to 0-3 added layers.
 * Easy to miss: Large layer height h is max-min row span of non-bg in cols 8+ (not full grid height); blocks in large layer skip bg cols; downward stacking may use varying deltas (e.g., 2h for full, 2h-1 for partial); extra block only if p>=1 and col5 non-bg; test has more cols (27), so large layer blocks extend further right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(This is reliable for non-destructive modification.)

```python
def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Accurately detects varying bg like 8,1,3 from top-left.)

```python
def get_small_rows(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[int]:
    candidates = [1, 3, 5, 7]
    n = len(g)
    return [r for r in candidates if r < n and g[r][1] != bg and g[r][3] != bg]
```
(Helpful for identifying control rows, but note it requires both col1 and col3 non-bg—may miss rows with only one; in train3, it would catch rows 1,3,5 with patterns like 2/3,3/3,3/4.)

```python
def has_col5(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, r: int) -> bool:
    n = len(g)
    return 0 <= r < n and g[r][5] != bg
```
(Useful for detecting optional third block in small rows, e.g., triggers extra in train2 row5 with 3 at col5.)

```python
def find_large_layer(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    n = len(g)
    if n == 0:
        return 0, 0, []
    m = len(g[0])
    large_rs = [r for r in range(n) if any(c != bg for c in g[r][8:m])]
    if not large_rs:
        return 0, 0, []
    start_r = min(large_rs)
    h = max(large_rs) - start_r + 1
    blocks = []
    i = 8
    while i < m:
        if g[start_r][i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        colr = g[start_r][i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < m and g[start_r][j] == colr:
            j += 1
        w = j - i
        blocks.append((i, w, colr))
        i = j
    return start_r, h, blocks
```
(This correctly extracts the large layer's start row, height, and block list (start_col, width, color) from cols 8+ in the first non-empty row of the span; helpful for base structure, but assumes blocks only in start_r—may miss vertical variations; works for train1's 4-blocks at cols~8-16.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed, indicating core placement logic is flawed despite detecting bg, small rows, and large layers.
 * Train1: Generated correctly placed initial small rows (1-3: left 4/1 patterns, middle 4's) and detected large layer (1's at rows7-9, cols8-16), but misplaced added layers—e.g., left 1's appear in row5 (unexpected, overwrites empty) instead of row5 empty/row6 middle 1's; bottom 1's duplicated at rows12-14 but shifted up one row from expected rows12-14 (expected has gap at row10-11); no extra block added, but p=2 so only two colors used correctly; unknown why left patterns in row5 but not aligned to expected.
 * Train2: Generated detected small rows (1:2/2? but shown as 2/2 wait, input not shown but output has row1:2's left, row3:1's left, row5:2's middle +3 left?); large layer partially captured (1's at rows8-9 cols10-16? but misplaced); added layers wrong—e.g., row7 has 1's left +3 but expected row7:1's left +1's middle no 3; row12-13 has 1's middle +3's right but expected row11-12:1's middle +3's right; extra 3's appear in row5/7/13/15 but expected only in specific spots like row5 col5, row11-12 cols16-17, row14-15 cols16-17; row4 has unexpected 2's middle; seems extra blocks added too often or wrong colors/spacing.
 * Train3: Bg=1 detected; small rows at 1(2/3),3(3/3),5(3/4); no large layer detected (since cols8+ all bg=1, so blocks=[] returns early, no additions); generated unchanged from input? But output shows left patterns in rows1,3,5,6? and bottom layers at rows15-17(3's),21-22(3/4) but expected has middle layers at rows10-11(2/3),15-17(3's),21-22(3/4); generated misses middle 2/3 entirely and places 3/4 too early/wrong; also row15-17 has 3's but shifted left/no 4's integrated; function find_large_layer broken here as no cols8+ non-bg, so skips all additions—unhelpful for cases without right-side large layer.
 * Overall: Layer stacking deltas wrong (e.g., is_top logic places downward but with incorrect 2h vs 2h-1, leading to overlaps/shifts); clipping helps but doesn't fix miscalculations; color assignment uses small row correctly but p limits it (good); extra block via has_col5 triggers but positioning (last + spacing) misaligns; w=h assumption okay but untested; program doesn't handle no-large-layer (just returns copy, but train3 needs additions? Wait, train3 expected has added bottom layers despite no large—major flaw).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it replicates some left small-row patterns (e.g., row1:1's at col1/3, row3:4's col1/3 +2 col5, row5:1/4/1 left, row6:1/4 left) and detects a large layer around rows10-13 (4's cols13-16, 2's cols18-21) and adds bottom layers at rows18-21 (4's +4's? +2's but colors wrong, expected likely 4's then 1's or per small), rows23-26 (1's cols13-16 +4's cols18-21 +1's cols24-27); but placements are shifted—e.g., row7 has unexpected 8 at col1 (bg=3, but 8!=3, possible overwrite error); row18-21 has 4's/2's but expected probably mirrored or color-swapped per small rows (e.g., using colors from row1/3/5 like 1,4,2); extra blocks added (e.g., row18-21 has extra 4's cols18-21 then 2's, but misaligned spacing); bottom rows23-26 have 1's/4's/1's but likely wrong colors (small row5 has 1/4/1? but p=2 for large? so extra via col5?); overall, similar to trains: left patterns kept but added layers misplaced vertically (gaps wrong, e.g., row14-17 all bg but expected may have more stacking), and right blocks not fully extended (27 cols suggest more blocks possible); doesn't match because training logic fails analogously—no large in trains3 but test has one, yet stacking buggy.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving colored grids where a background color dominates, with palettes defined in specific left-side columns and sample rows, used to fill in missing or patterned blocks (substructures) in the right half of the grid based on matching color sequences and positional rules for blocks of fixed size 's'. The goal is to output a completed grid by replicating palette colors into detected block positions, handling variations like extra columns or special matching cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) color is typically the most common or top-left value, but must be propagated correctly to all functions to avoid undefined variable errors.
 * Left columns (e.g., 1,3, possibly 5) hold palette info; detect if column 5 is active based on non-bg values in that column across rows.
 * Sample rows are every other row starting from the first non-empty left-column row, used to build the palette (k rows x m columns of colors).
 * Blocks on the right start at row b_start with height s (consecutive rows with non-bg in right half); sub_starts detect horizontal block positions in the first block row by runs of non-bg colors of length exactly s.
 * Palette matching (find_j) identifies which palette row 'j' matches the sub_colors sequence from the first block; includes a special case for m=2, len_left=3 where partial matches (e.g., first two colors same, skipping middle) are allowed if the third left color is non-bg.
 * Filling propagates non-j palettes to other block positions: forward steps use 2*s -1 spacing (or adjusted if first sample is row 0), backward uses 2*s +1; for extra left column (len_left=3), fill an additional block after the second sub with separator=1.
 * Subtleties: Block detection stops at first empty right-half row; fallback j=0 if no match; skip invalid b_s positions (out of bounds); only fill non-bg palette colors; m = number of sub-blocks per row; ensure row_out is a copy to avoid mutating input.
 * Easy to miss: Variable scoping (e.g., bg not passed to find_j); special matching logic for 3-left-columns case; step_sum calculations differ if first_sample_zero; width exactly == s for sub detection; filling loops must check column bounds.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]  # Simple top-left bg detection; works if bg is consistent.

    while r < n:
        if any(g[r][c] != bg for c in left_cols):

            r += 2
        else:
            break

```

```python
def get_b_start_and_s(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> tuple:

    has_non_right = [any(c != bg for c in row[n // 2:]) for row in g]
    b_start = 0
    s = 0
    current_start = 0
    for r in range(n):
        if has_non_right[r]:

    return b_start, s  # Detects block start row and height; critical for positioning, but fragile if no blocks (s=0 fallback).

    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] != bg:
            start = i
            color = row[i]
            width = 0
            while i < n and row[i] == color:
                width += 1
                i += 1
            if width == s:

        else:
            i += 1
    return sub_starts  # Finds horizontal block starts by exact-width runs; good for multi-sub-block rows.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (this single submission) failed due to execution errors: "name 'bg' is not defined" in find_j function, caused by missing parameter passing (bg used but not received); this prevented any grid processing or output generation.
 * What worked: Core structure detection (bg, left_cols, sample_rows, palette, b_start/s, sub_starts) seems logically sound based on puzzle patterns, with special cases for 3-column palettes and partial matching; filling logic attempts correct replication with spacing rules.
 * What didn't work: Variable scoping error halted execution entirely; no outputs generated, so unable to verify filling accuracy; special find_j matching (e.g., for m=2, len_left=3) references undefined bg, breaking palette index selection; step_sum calculations untested but potentially off if first_sample_zero mishandled; no handling for edge cases like s=0 or no matches (fallback j=0 may be wrong).
 * find_j function is broken due to missing bg param and complex logic that may overfit (special case for partial matches might miss true mismatches); still potentially helpful if fixed and simplified.
 * get_b_start_and_s is helpful but subtle bug: resets s=0 incorrectly on empty rows after blocks, and fallback b_start=current_start if s=0 may point to invalid area.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of palette/block mechanics but no successful runs; untested elements like d_forward/backward spacing and extra-column filling can't be validated.

**Test output:**
 * No actual grid outputs generated in any attempt due to execution errors; all results are "ERROR - Execution error: name 'bg' is not defined", which does not make sense or match expected completed grid (test input should produce a filled version with palettes replicated into right-side blocks per spacing rules).
 * Outputs are identical across training examples 1-3 and test (all errors), indicating a systemic scoping issue rather than input-specific failure; expected test output should show filled blocks (e.g., color sequences from non-j palettes copied to calculated b_s positions, with possible extra fills for column 5), but errors prevent comparison—likely incorrect as no filling occurs.
 * To handle test case, must fix bg passing (e.g., add bg param to find_j) and ensure out grid copies input correctly before modifications; test may involve first_sample_zero=True or len_left=3, requiring special step_sum and extra-block logic.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid completion where partial patterns (like colored blocks or evolving shapes) must be extended or filled vertically/horizontally based on detected motifs, such as uniform color blocks, single indicator cells, or evolving two-sided blocks with changing colors across "stages." The goal is to identify background color, locate key pattern starters (e.g., singles or blocks starting from column 7+), and replicate/extend them in predicted positions while preserving existing non-background elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common value in the flattened grid; all fillings should only replace background cells, never overwrite existing non-background colors.
 * Patterns often start or are indicated by "singles": rows with exactly two non-background cells at specific positions (e.g., columns 1 and 3), which signal the color and row for extending a block elsewhere (e.g., in columns 7+).
 * Uniform blocks are vertical stacks (height >=2) of consistent non-background positions (at least 4 columns wide, starting from column 7) with a single color; these may need extension based on singles, using steps like 2*h -1 where h is block height, and potentially adding "extensions" (extra sub-blocks) if singles have extra non-background in column 5.
 * Evolution blocks are two adjacent sub-blocks (equal width >=2, separated by gap) with different left/right colors; they evolve by decrementing/incrementing the higher color toward the lower one across stages (e.g., if left=4, right=2, next stage left=3, right=2), placed in multiples of height h with gaps (e.g., 2*h or 3*h between stages); determine stage by available space above (if enough for full prior stages, fill backward; else fill forward/backward).
 * Sub-blocks are contiguous runs of non-background positions; gaps between sub-blocks matter for evolution (e.g., consistent gap size).
 * Vertical spacing: Patterns repeat every 2*h -1 or multiples of h + gaps (e.g., 2*h); ensure new placements don't exceed grid bounds.
 * Subtle: Color evolution prefers decrementing the higher side or incrementing the lower; equal colors may default to decrement left/increment right. Singles may indicate multiple instances (num_singles), with extensions only after the first one having column 5 non-background.
 * Overlaps or partial grids: Existing patterns shouldn't be overwritten; if a placement would conflict, skip or adjust (though not handled well in code). Grid size varies (23x23 in trains, 27x27? in test), so n=len(g).
 * Easy to miss: Block detection only scans from column 7+ (assuming left side is for indicators); inconsistent sub-block widths/gaps break detection; evolution assumes two sub-blocks only, fails on more/fewer.
 * All trains show partial detection (e.g., singles/blocks found) but incorrect placement (wrong rows, missing extensions, wrong colors); test likely similar.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [c for row in g for c in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, e.g., 8 in train1/2, 1 in train3, 3 in test; essential for all fillings.)

```python
def find_singles(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    singles = []
    for i in range(n):
        row = g[i]
        nonb_pos = [j for j in range(n) if row[j] != b]
        if len(nonb_pos) == 2 and nonb_pos == [1, 3]:
            color = row[1]
            if row[3] == color:
                singles.append((i, color))
    return singles
```
(Partially helpful: Detects indicator rows with matching colors at cols 1/3; used in train1/2 to find starters like row3 color1, row5 color1; but misses if positions vary or more non-b exist; extendable for other indicator patterns.)

```python
def get_subblocks(pos: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not pos:
        return []
    pos = sorted(pos)
    sub = [pos[0]]
    subs = []
    for p in pos[1:]:
        if p == sub[-1] + 1:
            sub.append(p)
        else:
            subs.append(sub)
            sub = [p]
    subs.append(sub)
    return subs
```
(Helpful for splitting contiguous non-background runs, e.g., into left/right for evolution blocks; correctly identifies gaps, used in block detection.)

```python
def find_block(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[int], int] | None:
    # (code as provided; scans for vertical uniform blocks starting col7+, height>=2, single color, >=4 wide)
```
(Helpful in concept for uniform patterns like train1's 4-block at rows1-3 cols8-10/13-15; detects position/color but fails extension logic.)

```python
def find_evolution_block(g: List[List[int]], b: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, List[int], List[int], int, int] | None:
    # (code as provided; scans for two equal-width sub-blocks with different colors, consistent vertically)
```
(Helpful for train2/3/test evolutions, e.g., train2 left1/right3 at rows7-8 cols10-12/16-17? Wait, positions vary; detects structure but evolution rules buggy: wrong stage detection, color changes, placements.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples incorrect; program detects background and some patterns (e.g., singles in train1 rows 1? Wait no, row3/5; blocks in train1 rows1-3) but fails to place extensions correctly (wrong rows, missing sub-blocks, no color adaptation).
 * Train1: Generated correctly keeps top block of 4's at rows1-3 cols8-10/13-15 and singles at rows1/3 cols1/3 (but row indices off?); what worked: detected uniform block and singles; what didn't: missed placing new 1-block at rows6-8 cols8-10/13-15 (expected has it, generated all background); also missed lower 1-block at rows11-13; singles extension logic broken (step=2*h-1=5, but placements skip or wrong start).
 * Train2: Generated places some singles (rows1 col1/3=2, row3=1, row5=2? partial, row7=1) and partial blocks (rows4-5 cols10-12/14-15=2, but expected has them; row7-8 cols10-12/14-15=1); what worked: partial evolution detection (left/right split); what didn't: missed full stage3 at rows10-12 cols10-12/14-15=1 and cols16-17=3; placements only partial, no forward extension; color evolution wrong (didn't increment to 3 on right).
 * Train3: Background=1 detected; generated places some left-side singles (rows1 col1/3=2/3? partial, row3=3, row5=3/4) and lower blocks (rows10-11 cols11-12=2 cols16-17=3, rows14-15 cols11-12/16-17=3); what worked: detected some vertical patterns; what didn't: missed upper evolutions (e.g., no row20-21 cols11-12=3 cols16-17=4); placements inconsistent (e.g., row15 has 3's but expected all1; row10-11 has 2/3 but expected same; no decrement logic for colors 2->1 or 3->2); singles not used for extensions.
 * Overall: uniform_block path triggers in train1 but extension loop buggy (new_start calc wrong, has_ext never triggers properly, new_sub placement off); evo_block in train2/3 but stage detection flawed (assumes fixed distances like 3*h or 2*h, wrong color rules e.g., always -1 higher even if equal); no handling for multiple blocks or overlaps; find_block assumes single color from first row only, breaks if varies slightly; find_evolution_block requires exact two subs, fails if more (e.g., train1 has two but gapped); get_subblocks good but underused.
 * Function find_singles is helpful but too rigid (only cols1/3, len==2); find_block partially works for uniforms but loop breaks early on len<4; find_evolution_block detects structure but consistency check too strict (requires all non-b only in left+right, misses if extras); program(g) copies grid but only fills if block found, else evo, but no fallback for neither.
 * Unhelpful/broken: The ext_dict in uniform path (uses col5, but train1 has no col5 non-b, so first_ext_k stays num, has_ext never true, no extensions added); evolution color logic arbitrary (e.g., if cl>cr: s2l=cl-1 s2r=cr, but train2 needs increment on lower side); gap2=2*h hardcoded, but trains vary (train2 gap~2 rows between stages?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it partially fills some patterns but misses key extensions and has wrong placements/colors, similar to trains.
 * What was generated: Upper left singles at row0 cols1/3=1, row3 cols1/3/5=4/2? (row3 has col5=2, but expected unknown); block at rows2-5 cols18-21=2 (4-wide uniform); lower block at rows10-13 cols13-16=4; very bottom rows22-25 cols13-16=4 but cols18-21=3 (partial evolution?); row7 has col1=8 (outlier).
 * Differences from expected (inferred from pattern/rules, since no expected given): Likely misses evolution of the 2-block (rows2-5 cols18-21=2) to next stage (e.g., if single-side, extend down with color+1=3 at similar pos, height h=4, step~7, around row12-15 but generated has 4's there instead); upper row6 cols5=1 not extended; bottom 4-block should evolve to 5 or split left/right but stays 4 and adds wrong 3's in cols18-21; left singles (1/4) not used to place blocks in cols7+ (e.g., no 1-block or 4-evolution); background=3 preserved but fillings overwrite minimally, missing multiple stages (e.g., if evo from row2, prior stage above row0 impossible, so add below at row2+h+gap~row9-12 with evolved colors, but generated skips); overall, detects some blocks but wrong evolution (no color change to 3/5), wrong positions (cols13-16=4 unrelated to upper 18-21=2), and no full grid completion (many rows all-background, expected more patterns).
 * Does not make sense: Partial fillings suggest detection works (e.g., uniform 2-block, 4-block) but extension/evo rules fail (hardcoded distances wrong for 27x27, color logic doesn't match trains' decrement/increment); looks like uniform path triggered wrongly instead of evo, leading to static copies rather than evolving.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of integers (colors/pixels) where the goal is to detect a background color, identify "key" rows and columns with non-background indicators, extract a small key pattern from their intersections, determine a block scale from run lengths, and then "reveal" or fill a larger logo pattern by placing scaled blocks of colors from the key matrix into the grid at aligned positions, overwriting background cells while preserving existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (B) is the most common color in the flattened grid; everything else is a signal or part of the pattern.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (starting from 1, up to min(10, n)) that contain at least one non-B cell in the top min(8, n) rows— this acts as vertical "keys" or anchors for the pattern.
 * Key rows are those (up to top 8) that have at least one non-B in the key columns; the key matrix is extracted solely from intersections of key rows and key columns, forming an m x k color grid (often small, like 3x3).
 * Scale (s) is the maximum horizontal run of consecutive identical non-B cells in any row, used as the width (and sometimes height proxy) for logo blocks.
 * Block starts are horizontal positions where full s-length runs of non-B start across multiple rows; spacing between blocks is derived from differences in these starts (s + empty gaps).
 * Vertical placement: Align blocks to key rows' positions, but shift based on a "filled" index (matching key colors to existing blocks) and spacing; height (h) is derived from the vertical span of the first detected block.
 * Subtlety: Only fill background (B) cells; do not overwrite existing non-B cells. Protection rules skip filling in top/bottom borders if s==2 and B==8 (likely to avoid UI elements or frames).
 * Subtlety: If multiple block starts, use their differences for empty spacing; default to 1 if only one. Block starts may truncate if they exceed grid width.
 * Subtlety: "i_filled" is the highest key row index matching an existing block's color, used to anchor vertical shifts; r_starts are offset from the filled block's row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction is limited to top 8 rows/10 cols, even if grid is larger (e.g., 23x23 in examples); patterns may have side indicators (like vertical stripes in cols 1,3) that are not part of the main logo.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must be solid (all cells in the h x s rectangle match the color) in existing grid to validate; invalid blocks are skipped.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal block detection skips over B runs and only considers non-B runs of at least s.
 * Considerations: Grids can be 23x23 (training) or 27x27 (test); colors vary (1-8, B=8 or 3); patterns may have irregular heights or partial fills; multiple blocks per row/column.
 * All attempts assume logo is placed in a grid-aligned, spaced manner, but fail on vertical alignment or skipping invalid placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies B, used in all attempts and works across examples.)

```python
def get_key_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    key_cols = []
    for c in range(1, min(10, n), 2):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for r in range(min(8, n))):
            key_cols.append(c)
    return key_cols
```
(This identifies odd-indexed key columns with signals in top rows; helpful for anchoring, works in train3.)

```python
def get_key_rows(g: List[List[int]], B: int, key_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rows = set()
    for r in range(min(8, len(g))):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for c in key_cols):
            rows.add(r)
    return sorted(rows)
```
(This finds key rows based on key cols; essential for extracting the key matrix, accurate in examples.)

```python
def get_key_colors(g: List[List[int]], key_rows: List[int], key_cols: List[int], B: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    m = len(key_rows)
    k = len(key_cols)
    kc = [[B] * k for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        r = key_rows[i]
        for j in range(k):
            kc[i][j] = g[r][key_cols[j]]
    return kc
```
(This extracts the m x k key pattern; core to getting colors for filling, works but ignores B in key if present.)

```python
def get_scale(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> int:
    max_s = 1
    for row in g:
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == B:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_color = row[i]
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == start_color:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if length > max_s:
                max_s = length
            i = j
    return max_s
```
(This finds max non-B run length for block width s; helpful, but may overfit if runs vary; works for train3.)

```python
def get_main_start_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = set()
    for r in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i <= n - s:
            if all(g[r][c] == g[r][i] != B for c in range(i, i + s)):
                starts.add(i)
            j = i
            while j < n and g[r][j] == g[r][i]:
                j += 1
            i = j
    return sorted(list(starts))
```
(This detects horizontal start positions for s-length non-B runs; useful for horizontal spacing, but buggy as it adds starts even if not full blocks vertically.)

```python
def get_block_info(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, start_c: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    present_rows = []
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == g[r][start_c] != B for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            present_rows.append(r)
    if not present_rows:
        return None
    min_r = min(present_rows)
    max_r = max(present_rows)
    color = g[min_r][start_c]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        if not all(g[r][c] == color for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            return None
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    return (min_r, h, color)
```
(This validates vertical blocks at a start col, returning position, height, color if solid; helpful for detecting existing filled blocks, key to anchoring.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects B, key rows/cols, and key colors in all cases, as seen in partial matches.
 * Worked well for train3 (fully correct), indicating core logic for spacing, scaling, and filling aligns sometimes when patterns are simple/aligned.
 * Failed train1: Generated extra 4's in row1 cols18-20 (not in expected, which has empty there); placed 1's in rows16-18 cols8-10 but expected has them empty (only side indicators); missed aligning lower 1's blocks to match expected positions in rows11-13 and16-18; overfilled some areas ignoring protection.
 * Failed train2: Missed placing 1's block in rows7-8 cols10-14 (expected has it, but generated only has side 1's and 3's); duplicated 3's in rows10-13 cols16-17 but expected has them only lower; failed to shift vertical placements correctly for middle rows; extra empty rows unfilled.
 * get_main_start_cols is helpful but buggy—adds starts per row without requiring vertical consistency, leading to incorrect spacing (e.g., assumes too many starts in train1/2).
 * get_block_info is essential and mostly correct, but skips invalid blocks; in train1/2, it under-detects filled blocks, causing wrong i_filled (defaults to 0, misaligning r_starts).
 * Protection logic (skip top/bottom if s==2 and B==8) is unhelpful/broken for train1 (B=8, s likely 3, but still overfills borders); not triggered in train2 (B=8? wait, train2 seems B=8, but no protection applied correctly).
 * Vertical shifting via i_filled and r_starts works in train3 but fails in train1/2 due to poor matching of key colors to blocks (uses max possible_i, but misses color consistency across h).
 * Horizontal block_starts truncate correctly but spacing (s + empty) assumes uniform gaps; in train1, diff-based empty=1? leads to overlaps/misplacements.
 * Overall, attempt understands extraction and scaling but mishandles vertical alignment and validation, causing partial/overfills in complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies B=3, extracts keys (e.g., fills 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16,20-23 matching input hints), places scaled blocks (s likely 4, seen in 4x4 fills of 1,4,2), and uses spacing ~4+3=7 (e.g., blocks at cols13-16,20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overwrites/adds 8's in rows20-23 cols13-16 (input has empty 3's, but 8 may be invalid color for this grid—B=3, 8 seems out of place); misses filling some hinted areas like row3 col5=2 (remains isolated, not expanded to block); row5 col3=4 not expanded vertically/horizontally to match key; extra 1's in row5 col13-16 but input already has them, and it doesn't align all key rows (e.g., lower keys in rows15-18,20-23 partially filled but shifted wrong, adding 1's in row19? wait, row15-18 has 1's and 4's but expected likely needs consistent h=4 blocks); side indicators (cols1,3,5) preserved but logo blocks seem misaligned vertically (e.g., row20-23 8's block doesn't match any key color pattern).
 * Fills bottom rows20-23 with 8's block, but input has no such hint there—likely wrong color from key mismatch or invalid extraction; upper rows0-3 side fills (1,4,2) not blocked properly.
 * To handle test: Need better block validation (require full h consistency before filling), correct i_filled to min/max instead of max, and ignore/exclude B=3 in key_colors properly; spacing may need vertical detection too.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg via frequency.)

```python
def find_min_fg(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> int:
    candidates = [c for row in g for c in row if c != bg]
    return min(candidates) if candidates else bg
```
(Helpful: Gets lowest foreground color for default additions.)

```python
def find_large_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]]:
    # (Full flood-fill based detection of filled rectangular components >1 cell)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'y1', 'y2', 'x1', 'x2', 'color', 'h', 'w'
```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

```python
def has_special(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int, blocks: tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]], y1: int, h: int, large_color: int, min_fg: int) -> tp.Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if not blocks:
        return False, 0
    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step
        if p1 >= 0:
            added.append(p1)
            p2 = y1 - 2 * step
            if p2 >= 0:
                added.append(p2)
    return added
```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

```python
def add_rectangle(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], py: int, x1: int, x2: int, color: int, h: int, n: int):
    for i in range(h):
        yy = py + i
        if 0 <= yy < n:
            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def find_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]
    c = Counter(flat)
    return c.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Finds the dominant background color reliably.)

```python
def normalize_grid(grid: List[List[int]], mapping: dict) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[mapping.get(cell, cell) for cell in row] for row in grid]
```
(Standardizes colors; mapping like {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0} is fixed and crucial for consistency across examples.)

```python
def extract_key(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[List[int]]:

        row_key = [grid[r][c] for c in [1, 3, 5] if c < size and grid[r][c] != bg]
        if row_key:
            key.append(row_key)
    return key
```
(Extracts key sequences from left-side positions in odd rows; filters non-bg; extend range if size > typical 23x23.)

    return source_start, source_h, block_configs
```
(Detects central source block by matching run configs (start, width, color) across consecutive rows; restricts to center horizontally; returns start row, height, and configs.)

```
(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or signals on a background, where the task is to detect sparse "signals" in vertical tracks and use them to identify and extend uniform colored block patterns across the grid, anchoring from an existing block structure and propagating it to match signal sequences in other rows. The goal is to fill in missing blocks while preserving existing content and ensuring blocks are uniform rectangles that align with signal colors as subsequences.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color, often 3 in examples; all uniform rows help confirm it, but fall back to top-left if no full uniform row.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals—defined as having at least one non-bg cell, but crucially only those where non-bg cells are isolated (max consecutive non-bg == 1, no clumps).
 * Signals are rows with non-bg cells in tracks; collect unique such rows, sort them, and extract non-bg colors from tracks in those rows (excluding 8, which may be a special/noise value).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ consecutive identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start, end) ranges across the grid.
 * Anchor detection: Search for a rectangular block structure (height h >=2, starting at row s) where blocks are uniform color across height, all blocks same width w, positions match a sorted list of block ranges, and the sequence of block colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors.
 * Extension: Once anchored, propagate to other signal rows by calculating row positions with forward/backward steps (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward), extending block ranges rightward if needed (with fixed gap between blocks), and placing only on bg cells.
 * Fallback if no anchor: Use default h=2, w=2, start blocks at center, step backward from bottom, extend ranges, place blocks— but this seems less precise and may overlap or misalign.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., blocks match a subset); only place on bg to avoid overwriting; ensure extended ranges don't exceed grid size; gap between blocks is derived from anchor (end1 +1 + gap = start2); signals may have varying numbers of colors, so extend blocks to match; isolated signals (max_consec=1) define tracks, but blocks can be wider; 8 is ignored in signal colors, possibly a delimiter or invalid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no signals returns copy; anchor search starts from larger h downward, left-to-right s; if multiple anchors possible, takes first found; propagation skips invalid positions (out of bounds); in fallback, starts from bottom and steps up (negative direction).
 * All existing non-bg must be preserved unless overwritten logically, but code only overwrites bg; block colors must exactly match signal colors in order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchor-based propagation.
 * Anchor finding with subsequence matching worked well for trainings, allowing flexible pattern extension without requiring exact sequence matches.
 * Fallback logic (default blocks from bottom) was not triggered in trainings (since anchors found), but ensures something is placed if no anchor.
 * get_tracks enforces isolated signals (max_consec=1), which is crucial and worked; without it, clumped columns might be misidentified.
 * place_blocks only overwrites bg, preserving existing non-bg, which is correct and prevented overwriting in trainings.
 * extend_block_ranges correctly adds blocks rightward with fixed gap and width, handling varying signal lengths.
 * No major misses in trainings, but search for anchor starts from larger h downward and left s, which may prefer certain patterns; step calculations (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) seem empirically tuned for spacing between signal rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows placements in rows 10-13 (4-wide blocks of 4 at cols 13-16, 2 at 18-21), rows 17-20 (4-wide 1 at 13-16, 4 at 18-21, 1 at 23-26), and scattered signals in upper rows (e.g., row1: 1s at cols1,3,13-16,18-21,23-26; row3 similar), with some existing patterns like row3 cols13-16=1s preserved/modified minimally.
 * It looks partially correct: blocks are uniform rectangles matching apparent signal colors (e.g., 4s and 2s in lower, 1s and 4s in mid-lower), placed on bg=3 without overwriting, and aligned to even-ish columns suggesting track influence; spacing/gaps seem consistent (e.g., gap=1 between block groups).
 * However, upper signals (rows 1-5) have placements like isolated 1/4/2 in even cols (0,2,5?), but code targets odd tracks— this may be existing input not extended, or fallback/misplacement; row6 has 1/4/1 but no block extension visible, suggesting propagation skipped invalid positions.
 * Lower blocks (rows10-13,17-20) match multi-color signals (e.g., [4,2] subsequence for row10+), but row14-16 are all bg—no placement, possibly no matching signal or out-of-bounds; overall, it makes sense as an extension but may miss forward propagation from anchor (if anchor in upper/mid) or undetect some tracks (e.g., col5 has signals but no blocks there).
 * Existing input has vertical alignments (e.g., cols13-16 have 1s in rows2-5, then 4s lower), and output extends horizontally into blocks, which aligns with rules; no obvious errors like overwriting non-bg or mismatched colors, but subtle issue: signal rows include row7? (all bg, skipped correctly), and 8 in row7 col1 ignored properly.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:12:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid represents a pattern with a background color, vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns) containing isolated signal colors, and horizontal "blocks" (consecutive cells of the same non-background color, at least 2 wide) that need to be detected, anchored, and extended or placed vertically to match subsequences of signal colors across multiple rows. The goal is to generate an output grid that completes or replicates these block patterns at relative positions based on an anchor point, filling only background areas without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the most common or uniform row color (e.g., 3), but must be reliably detected even if not all rows are uniform.
 * Tracks are specifically odd-indexed columns (j in range(1, size, 2)) that contain at least one non-background cell, but only qualify if all non-background cells are isolated (max consecutive == 1), indicating "signals" rather than blocks.
 * Signal rows are those with any non-background in tracks; signal colors are the list of non-background values in those tracks per row, in track order.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of the same non-background color (>=2 wide) across any row; all detected blocks must have uniform width (h) for anchoring to work, otherwise fall back to default placement.
 * Anchoring requires finding a starting row s where a vertical stack of h rows has uniform horizontal blocks matching the positions/sizes in block_ranges, and their colors form a subsequence of one signal_colors list (using is_subsequence check); this anchor_k identifies which signal to "root" placements to.
 * Placements extend blocks forward/backward from anchor using steps (e.g., 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and differences from existing ranges; only fill background cells, and limit to grid bounds.
 * If no blocks or no anchor found, default to h=2, centered horizontal placements with fixed spacing (diff_start=2*h+1, vertical step=2*h+1), starting from grid center.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., block colors can be a subset of signal colors in order); placements can overlap or extend partial blocks but shouldn't overwrite non-bg; vertical positioning uses delta * step, with forward/backward steps differing to avoid overlap; isolated signals (max_consec=1) distinguish tracks from potential vertical blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty signals return input unchanged; non-uniform block widths or invalid anchors trigger default mode; bounds checking prevents out-of-grid placements; multiple signals per row possible, but colors list per signal_row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure block detection scans all rows but deduplicates ranges by position; vertical uniformity check in anchor must verify entire block rectangle is same color; default mode assumes symmetric centering but may not fit odd-sized grids perfectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    if size == 0:
        return 0
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This reliably detects uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for grids with mixed rows.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                max_consec = max(max_consec, consec)
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(Key for identifying signal tracks; enforces isolation to avoid mistaking vertical blocks for signals.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Essential for matching block color sequences to signal colors; allows skipping in b for partial fits.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(Extracts unique horizontal block positions/sizes; deduplicates to find consistent patterns across rows.)

```python
def find_anchor(g: List[List[int]], block_ranges: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, signal_colors: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # (Full function body as in program; checks vertical uniformity and subsequence match)
```
(Core for locating anchor; verifies full rectangular uniformity, which is subtle and easy to miss.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * extend_ranges and place_blocks: These are implementation helpers but can over-extend beyond grid or place on non-bg if not careful (e.g., no overwrite check in place_blocks beyond bg==3); they're functional but brittle for varying sizes.
 * The default placement logic in program (when no blocks/anchor): Assumes fixed h=2 and centering, which works for training but may not generalize to test if input expects different h or asymmetry; it's a fallback but overrides custom block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchoring/placement logic.
 * Worked well: Uniform background detection, isolated signal filtering in tracks, subsequence matching for anchors, and relative placement with steps (forward/backward differentiation avoids overlap in training).
 * Did not work/partial issues: In default mode (no blocks), fixed spacing (e.g., diff_start=2*h+1) may not align with input patterns if test has asymmetric or wider defaults; anchor search assumes blocks exist in exact range positions vertically, which could miss partial or shifted anchors.
 * Block width uniformity check is strict (len(widths)!=1 returns copy), which is good for consistency but may fail tests with mixed widths (fallback to default helps but isn't adaptive).
 * No explicit handling for multiple block sets per row or vertical signals misidentified as tracks (but max_consec=1 prevents most).
 * Training successes suggest extract-like functions (get_tracks, get_signal_colors, get_block_ranges) are essential for decomposing the grid into signals vs. blocks.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt demonstrates progressive logic (detect -> extract -> anchor -> place), which is helpful for future refinements.

 * The generated test output (27x27 grid, bg=3) shows partial placements: e.g., row 1 has isolated 1's in positions ~1,3,5 (possibly misplaced signals) and a block of four 1's starting ~13, then another at ~18-21 and ~23-26; row 3 has similar but with 4's and a 2; rows 10-13 have vertical stacks of four 4's (~13-16) and four 2's (~18-21,23-26); rows 17-20 mirror with 1's and four 4's.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely complete symmetric horizontal blocks across full h-height vertical stacks matching all signal_colors subsequences, but here placements are inconsistent—e.g., row 1 has singles (not blocks >=2), row 2/4/5 are mostly bg with trailing 1's (partial fills?), and upper rows (0,6-9) are all bg (possibly no signals there). Lower blocks (rows 10-13,17-20) look like proper 4-high stacks, but spacing/diffs seem off (e.g., 4's and 2's blocks are adjacent without expected gaps like 2*h+1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input had partial anchors or signals in odd columns, output should extend uniformly without isolated cells (e.g., row1 singles suggest failed block placement or track misdetection); vertical stacks are present but may not match all signal rows (e.g., no clear anchor in upper half); many rows remain all-bg, indicating skipped placements due to bounds or delta*step overflow (size=27, steps~5 for h=2 could skip). Unknown why upper signals (1,4,2) didn't form full blocks—possibly anchor not found, triggering partial default.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense (some block completions) but appears incomplete/inaccurate, missing full pattern replication (e.g., no forward/backward extensions from a clear anchor; irregularities like non-uniform heights).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of integers (colors/pixels) where the goal is to detect a background color, identify "key" rows and columns with non-background indicators, extract a small key pattern from their intersections, determine a block scale from run lengths, and then "reveal" or fill a larger logo pattern by placing scaled blocks of colors from the key matrix into the grid at aligned positions, overwriting background cells while preserving existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (B) is the most common color in the flattened grid; everything else is a signal or part of the pattern.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (starting from 1, up to min(10, n)) that contain at least one non-B cell in the top min(8, n) rows— this acts as vertical "keys" or anchors for the pattern.
 * Key rows are those (up to top 8) that have at least one non-B in the key columns; the key matrix is extracted solely from intersections of key rows and key columns, forming an m x k color grid (often small, like 3x3).
 * Scale (s) is the maximum horizontal run of consecutive identical non-B cells in any row, used as the width (and sometimes height proxy) for logo blocks.
 * Block starts are horizontal positions where full s-length runs of non-B start across multiple rows; spacing between blocks is derived from differences in these starts (s + empty gaps).
 * Vertical placement: Align blocks to key rows' positions, but shift based on a "filled" index (matching key colors to existing blocks) and spacing; height (h) is derived from the vertical span of the first detected block.
 * Subtlety: Only fill background (B) cells; do not overwrite existing non-B cells. Protection rules skip filling in top/bottom borders if s==2 and B==8 (likely to avoid UI elements or frames).
 * Subtlety: If multiple block starts, use their differences for empty spacing; default to 1 if only one. Block starts may truncate if they exceed grid width.
 * Subtlety: "i_filled" is the highest key row index matching an existing block's color, used to anchor vertical shifts; r_starts are offset from the filled block's row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction is limited to top 8 rows/10 cols, even if grid is larger (e.g., 23x23 in examples); patterns may have side indicators (like vertical stripes in cols 1,3) that are not part of the main logo.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must be solid (all cells in the h x s rectangle match the color) in existing grid to validate; invalid blocks are skipped.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal block detection skips over B runs and only considers non-B runs of at least s.
 * Considerations: Grids can be 23x23 (training) or 27x27 (test); colors vary (1-8, B=8 or 3); patterns may have irregular heights or partial fills; multiple blocks per row/column.
 * All attempts assume logo is placed in a grid-aligned, spaced manner, but fail on vertical alignment or skipping invalid placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies B, used in all attempts and works across examples.)

```python
def get_key_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    key_cols = []
    for c in range(1, min(10, n), 2):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for r in range(min(8, n))):
            key_cols.append(c)
    return key_cols
```
(This identifies odd-indexed key columns with signals in top rows; helpful for anchoring, works in train3.)

```python
def get_key_rows(g: List[List[int]], B: int, key_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rows = set()
    for r in range(min(8, len(g))):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for c in key_cols):
            rows.add(r)
    return sorted(rows)
```
(This finds key rows based on key cols; essential for extracting the key matrix, accurate in examples.)

```python
def get_key_colors(g: List[List[int]], key_rows: List[int], key_cols: List[int], B: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    m = len(key_rows)
    k = len(key_cols)
    kc = [[B] * k for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        r = key_rows[i]
        for j in range(k):
            kc[i][j] = g[r][key_cols[j]]
    return kc
```
(This extracts the m x k key pattern; core to getting colors for filling, works but ignores B in key if present.)

```python
def get_scale(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> int:
    max_s = 1
    for row in g:
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == B:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_color = row[i]
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == start_color:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if length > max_s:
                max_s = length
            i = j
    return max_s
```
(This finds max non-B run length for block width s; helpful, but may overfit if runs vary; works for train3.)

```python
def get_main_start_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = set()
    for r in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i <= n - s:
            if all(g[r][c] == g[r][i] != B for c in range(i, i + s)):
                starts.add(i)
            j = i
            while j < n and g[r][j] == g[r][i]:
                j += 1
            i = j
    return sorted(list(starts))
```
(This detects horizontal start positions for s-length non-B runs; useful for horizontal spacing, but buggy as it adds starts even if not full blocks vertically.)

```python
def get_block_info(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, start_c: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    present_rows = []
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == g[r][start_c] != B for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            present_rows.append(r)
    if not present_rows:
        return None
    min_r = min(present_rows)
    max_r = max(present_rows)
    color = g[min_r][start_c]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        if not all(g[r][c] == color for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            return None
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    return (min_r, h, color)
```
(This validates vertical blocks at a start col, returning position, height, color if solid; helpful for detecting existing filled blocks, key to anchoring.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects B, key rows/cols, and key colors in all cases, as seen in partial matches.
 * Worked well for train3 (fully correct), indicating core logic for spacing, scaling, and filling aligns sometimes when patterns are simple/aligned.
 * Failed train1: Generated extra 4's in row1 cols18-20 (not in expected, which has empty there); placed 1's in rows16-18 cols8-10 but expected has them empty (only side indicators); missed aligning lower 1's blocks to match expected positions in rows11-13 and16-18; overfilled some areas ignoring protection.
 * Failed train2: Missed placing 1's block in rows7-8 cols10-14 (expected has it, but generated only has side 1's and 3's); duplicated 3's in rows10-13 cols16-17 but expected has them only lower; failed to shift vertical placements correctly for middle rows; extra empty rows unfilled.
 * get_main_start_cols is helpful but buggy—adds starts per row without requiring vertical consistency, leading to incorrect spacing (e.g., assumes too many starts in train1/2).
 * get_block_info is essential and mostly correct, but skips invalid blocks; in train1/2, it under-detects filled blocks, causing wrong i_filled (defaults to 0, misaligning r_starts).
 * Protection logic (skip top/bottom if s==2 and B==8) is unhelpful/broken for train1 (B=8, s likely 3, but still overfills borders); not triggered in train2 (B=8? wait, train2 seems B=8, but no protection applied correctly).
 * Vertical shifting via i_filled and r_starts works in train3 but fails in train1/2 due to poor matching of key colors to blocks (uses max possible_i, but misses color consistency across h).
 * Horizontal block_starts truncate correctly but spacing (s + empty) assumes uniform gaps; in train1, diff-based empty=1? leads to overlaps/misplacements.
 * Overall, attempt understands extraction and scaling but mishandles vertical alignment and validation, causing partial/overfills in complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies B=3, extracts keys (e.g., fills 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16,20-23 matching input hints), places scaled blocks (s likely 4, seen in 4x4 fills of 1,4,2), and uses spacing ~4+3=7 (e.g., blocks at cols13-16,20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overwrites/adds 8's in rows20-23 cols13-16 (input has empty 3's, but 8 may be invalid color for this grid—B=3, 8 seems out of place); misses filling some hinted areas like row3 col5=2 (remains isolated, not expanded to block); row5 col3=4 not expanded vertically/horizontally to match key; extra 1's in row5 col13-16 but input already has them, and it doesn't align all key rows (e.g., lower keys in rows15-18,20-23 partially filled but shifted wrong, adding 1's in row19? wait, row15-18 has 1's and 4's but expected likely needs consistent h=4 blocks); side indicators (cols1,3,5) preserved but logo blocks seem misaligned vertically (e.g., row20-23 8's block doesn't match any key color pattern).
 * Fills bottom rows20-23 with 8's block, but input has no such hint there—likely wrong color from key mismatch or invalid extraction; upper rows0-3 side fills (1,4,2) not blocked properly.
 * To handle test: Need better block validation (require full h consistency before filling), correct i_filled to min/max instead of max, and ignore/exclude B=3 in key_colors properly; spacing may need vertical detection too.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def find_background(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)
    return count.most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg via frequency.)

```python
def find_min_fg(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> int:
    candidates = [c for row in g for c in row if c != bg]
    return min(candidates) if candidates else bg
```
(Helpful: Gets lowest foreground color for default additions.)

```python
def find_large_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]]:
    # (Full flood-fill based detection of filled rectangular components >1 cell)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'y1', 'y2', 'x1', 'x2', 'color', 'h', 'w'
```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

```python
def has_special(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int, blocks: tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]], y1: int, h: int, large_color: int, min_fg: int) -> tp.Tuple[bool, int]:
    n = len(g)
    if not blocks:
        return False, 0
    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step
        if p1 >= 0:
            added.append(p1)
            p2 = y1 - 2 * step
            if p2 >= 0:
                added.append(p2)
    return added
```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

```python
def add_rectangle(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], py: int, x1: int, x2: int, color: int, h: int, n: int):
    for i in range(h):
        yy = py + i
        if 0 <= yy < n:
            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

(Standardizes colors; mapping like {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0} is fixed and crucial for consistency across examples.)

```
(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid represents a pattern with a background color, vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns) containing isolated signal colors, and horizontal "blocks" (consecutive cells of the same non-background color, at least 2 wide) that need to be detected, anchored, and extended or placed vertically to match subsequences of signal colors across multiple rows. The goal is to generate an output grid that completes or replicates these block patterns at relative positions based on an anchor point, filling only background areas without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the most common or uniform row color (e.g., 3), but must be reliably detected even if not all rows are uniform.
 * Tracks are specifically odd-indexed columns (j in range(1, size, 2)) that contain at least one non-background cell, but only qualify if all non-background cells are isolated (max consecutive == 1), indicating "signals" rather than blocks.
 * Signal rows are those with any non-background in tracks; signal colors are the list of non-background values in those tracks per row, in track order.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of the same non-background color (>=2 wide) across any row; all detected blocks must have uniform width (h) for anchoring to work, otherwise fall back to default placement.
 * Anchoring requires finding a starting row s where a vertical stack of h rows has uniform horizontal blocks matching the positions/sizes in block_ranges, and their colors form a subsequence of one signal_colors list (using is_subsequence check); this anchor_k identifies which signal to "root" placements to.
 * Placements extend blocks forward/backward from anchor using steps (e.g., 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and differences from existing ranges; only fill background cells, and limit to grid bounds.
 * If no blocks or no anchor found, default to h=2, centered horizontal placements with fixed spacing (diff_start=2*h+1, vertical step=2*h+1), starting from grid center.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., block colors can be a subset of signal colors in order); placements can overlap or extend partial blocks but shouldn't overwrite non-bg; vertical positioning uses delta * step, with forward/backward steps differing to avoid overlap; isolated signals (max_consec=1) distinguish tracks from potential vertical blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty signals return input unchanged; non-uniform block widths or invalid anchors trigger default mode; bounds checking prevents out-of-grid placements; multiple signals per row possible, but colors list per signal_row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure block detection scans all rows but deduplicates ranges by position; vertical uniformity check in anchor must verify entire block rectangle is same color; default mode assumes symmetric centering but may not fit odd-sized grids perfectly.

    # (Full function body as in program; checks vertical uniformity and subsequence match)
```
(Core for locating anchor; verifies full rectangular uniformity, which is subtle and easy to miss.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * extend_ranges and place_blocks: These are implementation helpers but can over-extend beyond grid or place on non-bg if not careful (e.g., no overwrite check in place_blocks beyond bg==3); they're functional but brittle for varying sizes.
 * The default placement logic in program (when no blocks/anchor): Assumes fixed h=2 and centering, which works for training but may not generalize to test if input expects different h or asymmetry; it's a fallback but overrides custom block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchoring/placement logic.
 * Worked well: Uniform background detection, isolated signal filtering in tracks, subsequence matching for anchors, and relative placement with steps (forward/backward differentiation avoids overlap in training).
 * Did not work/partial issues: In default mode (no blocks), fixed spacing (e.g., diff_start=2*h+1) may not align with input patterns if test has asymmetric or wider defaults; anchor search assumes blocks exist in exact range positions vertically, which could miss partial or shifted anchors.
 * Block width uniformity check is strict (len(widths)!=1 returns copy), which is good for consistency but may fail tests with mixed widths (fallback to default helps but isn't adaptive).
 * No explicit handling for multiple block sets per row or vertical signals misidentified as tracks (but max_consec=1 prevents most).
 * Training successes suggest extract-like functions (get_tracks, get_signal_colors, get_block_ranges) are essential for decomposing the grid into signals vs. blocks.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt demonstrates progressive logic (detect -> extract -> anchor -> place), which is helpful for future refinements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (27x27 grid, bg=3) shows partial placements: e.g., row 1 has isolated 1's in positions ~1,3,5 (possibly misplaced signals) and a block of four 1's starting ~13, then another at ~18-21 and ~23-26; row 3 has similar but with 4's and a 2; rows 10-13 have vertical stacks of four 4's (~13-16) and four 2's (~18-21,23-26); rows 17-20 mirror with 1's and four 4's.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely complete symmetric horizontal blocks across full h-height vertical stacks matching all signal_colors subsequences, but here placements are inconsistent—e.g., row 1 has singles (not blocks >=2), row 2/4/5 are mostly bg with trailing 1's (partial fills?), and upper rows (0,6-9) are all bg (possibly no signals there). Lower blocks (rows 10-13,17-20) look like proper 4-high stacks, but spacing/diffs seem off (e.g., 4's and 2's blocks are adjacent without expected gaps like 2*h+1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input had partial anchors or signals in odd columns, output should extend uniformly without isolated cells (e.g., row1 singles suggest failed block placement or track misdetection); vertical stacks are present but may not match all signal rows (e.g., no clear anchor in upper half); many rows remain all-bg, indicating skipped placements due to bounds or delta*step overflow (size=27, steps~5 for h=2 could skip). Unknown why upper signals (1,4,2) didn't form full blocks—possibly anchor not found, triggering partial default.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense (some block completions) but appears incomplete/inaccurate, missing full pattern replication (e.g., no forward/backward extensions from a clear anchor; irregularities like non-uniform heights).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or signals on a background, where the task is to detect sparse "signals" in vertical tracks and use them to identify and extend uniform colored block patterns across the grid, anchoring from an existing block structure and propagating it to match signal sequences in other rows. The goal is to fill in missing blocks while preserving existing content and ensuring blocks are uniform rectangles that align with signal colors as subsequences.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color, often 3 in examples; all uniform rows help confirm it, but fall back to top-left if no full uniform row.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals—defined as having at least one non-bg cell, but crucially only those where non-bg cells are isolated (max consecutive non-bg == 1, no clumps).
 * Signals are rows with non-bg cells in tracks; collect unique such rows, sort them, and extract non-bg colors from tracks in those rows (excluding 8, which may be a special/noise value).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ consecutive identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start, end) ranges across the grid.
 * Anchor detection: Search for a rectangular block structure (height h >=2, starting at row s) where blocks are uniform color across height, all blocks same width w, positions match a sorted list of block ranges, and the sequence of block colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors.
 * Extension: Once anchored, propagate to other signal rows by calculating row positions with forward/backward steps (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward), extending block ranges rightward if needed (with fixed gap between blocks), and placing only on bg cells.
 * Fallback if no anchor: Use default h=2, w=2, start blocks at center, step backward from bottom, extend ranges, place blocks— but this seems less precise and may overlap or misalign.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., blocks match a subset); only place on bg to avoid overwriting; ensure extended ranges don't exceed grid size; gap between blocks is derived from anchor (end1 +1 + gap = start2); signals may have varying numbers of colors, so extend blocks to match; isolated signals (max_consec=1) define tracks, but blocks can be wider; 8 is ignored in signal colors, possibly a delimiter or invalid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no signals returns copy; anchor search starts from larger h downward, left-to-right s; if multiple anchors possible, takes first found; propagation skips invalid positions (out of bounds); in fallback, starts from bottom and steps up (negative direction).
 * All existing non-bg must be preserved unless overwritten logically, but code only overwrites bg; block colors must exactly match signal colors in order.

    # Searches for anchor: uniform rectangular blocks matching a signal subsequence; returns start row s, height h, signal index kk, sorted block ranges, width w.
    # (Full implementation as in program; key is validating uniformity and subsequence match.)
    # ... (code as provided)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchor-based propagation.
 * Anchor finding with subsequence matching worked well for trainings, allowing flexible pattern extension without requiring exact sequence matches.
 * Fallback logic (default blocks from bottom) was not triggered in trainings (since anchors found), but ensures something is placed if no anchor.
 * get_tracks enforces isolated signals (max_consec=1), which is crucial and worked; without it, clumped columns might be misidentified.
 * place_blocks only overwrites bg, preserving existing non-bg, which is correct and prevented overwriting in trainings.
 * extend_block_ranges correctly adds blocks rightward with fixed gap and width, handling varying signal lengths.
 * No major misses in trainings, but search for anchor starts from larger h downward and left s, which may prefer certain patterns; step calculations (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) seem empirically tuned for spacing between signal rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows placements in rows 10-13 (4-wide blocks of 4 at cols 13-16, 2 at 18-21), rows 17-20 (4-wide 1 at 13-16, 4 at 18-21, 1 at 23-26), and scattered signals in upper rows (e.g., row1: 1s at cols1,3,13-16,18-21,23-26; row3 similar), with some existing patterns like row3 cols13-16=1s preserved/modified minimally.
 * It looks partially correct: blocks are uniform rectangles matching apparent signal colors (e.g., 4s and 2s in lower, 1s and 4s in mid-lower), placed on bg=3 without overwriting, and aligned to even-ish columns suggesting track influence; spacing/gaps seem consistent (e.g., gap=1 between block groups).
 * However, upper signals (rows 1-5) have placements like isolated 1/4/2 in even cols (0,2,5?), but code targets odd tracks— this may be existing input not extended, or fallback/misplacement; row6 has 1/4/1 but no block extension visible, suggesting propagation skipped invalid positions.
 * Lower blocks (rows10-13,17-20) match multi-color signals (e.g., [4,2] subsequence for row10+), but row14-16 are all bg—no placement, possibly no matching signal or out-of-bounds; overall, it makes sense as an extension but may miss forward propagation from anchor (if anchor in upper/mid) or undetect some tracks (e.g., col5 has signals but no blocks there).
 * Existing input has vertical alignments (e.g., cols13-16 have 1s in rows2-5, then 4s lower), and output extends horizontally into blocks, which aligns with rules; no obvious errors like overwriting non-bg or mismatched colors, but subtle issue: signal rows include row7? (all bg, skipped correctly), and 8 in row7 col1 ignored properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

[2025-10-03 10:18:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving detection and replication of horizontal block patterns (anchors) across multiple rows, guided by "key" sequences extracted from specific rows and columns, to fill in missing or implied parts of the grid while preserving the background and avoiding overwriting existing non-background elements. The goal is to identify repeating block structures and propagate them vertically using patterned stepping, matching color sequences from keys to ensure correct placement.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common color; all placements must respect it by only overwriting bg cells, never existing non-bg cells.
 * Horizontal runs are sequences of identical non-bg cells of length >=2; anchors require identical run starts, lengths (>=2), and colors repeating for at least h=2 consecutive rows.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (1,3,5,7,9) with any non-bg in the first 8 rows; key rows are those with non-bg in key columns (first 8 rows); key colors are non-bg, non-8 values from key row-key col intersections, forming per-row color lists that act as sequence guides.
 * Anchor selection prioritizes tallest h, then earliest start row s, and requires block colors to be a subsequence of some key color list; spacing (diff) between blocks is derived from starts or defaults to w+2 if single block.
 * Placement for other keys uses delta-based stepping: step_down=2*h-1 for below, step_up=2*h+1 for above; extend block starts rightward using anchor_diff if key sequence is longer than anchor blocks.
 * Subtle: Exclude color 8 from keys (possibly a special marker or invalid for replication); single-block anchors use w+2 as diff; only place if target row range fits grid; subsequence matching allows partial embeds (e.g., anchor colors subset of key).
 * Grids may have size >8 (up to 27x27 in test), but keys limited to first 8 rows/cols; patterns may not span full width; replication only for matching subsequences, skipping if out-of-bounds or no match.
 * Potential misses: Wrong anchor selection (e.g., picking a shorter/wrong-color repeat); incorrect stepping leading to overlap or misplacement; failing to extend blocks for longer keys; not handling isolated non-repeating patterns.
 * All attempts assume rectangular grid input/output; preserve existing non-bg (only fill bg).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return [row[:] for row in g]

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
```python
def get_runs(row: List[int], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    # Extracts horizontal runs: (start_col, length, color) for non-bg sequences >=2 long
    runs = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row)
    while i < n:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        col = row[i]
        while i < n and row[i] == col:
            i += 1
        leng = i - start
        if leng >= 2:
            runs.append((start, leng, col))
    return runs
```
```python
def is_subsequence(sub: List[int], full: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Checks if sub is a subsequence of full (allows non-contiguous matching)
    if not sub:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in full:
        if i < len(sub) and val == sub[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(sub):
                return True
    return i == len(sub)
```
```python
def place_block(out: List[List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, start_c: int, w: int, col: int, bg: int, size: int):
    # Fills a rectangular block of color col over bg cells only, clipped to grid
    for r in range(start_r, min(start_r + h, size)):
        for c in range(start_c, min(start_c + w, size)):
            if out[r][c] == bg:
                out[r][c] = col
```
(Note: get_key_cols, get_key_rows, get_key_colors, find_anchor are helpful but buggy in current form—e.g., find_anchor has return tuple mismatch and incomplete extension logic; use as base but fix.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The current find_anchor: Broken return (appends extra h, slices to 6 but expects 7); assumes uniform w across blocks (fails if varied); diff calculation assumes >=2 blocks or defaults poorly; doesn't handle multiple possible anchors well (picks by h then s, but may miss best subsequence match).
 * get_key_colors: Excludes 8 arbitrarily (works for train1 bg=8 but may be puzzle rule); filters only key_cols but ignores full row context.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) passed training examples 2 and 3 fully (correct outputs match expected, demonstrating core anchor detection, key extraction, and stepping work for those cases).
 * Failed training example 1: Generated output incorrectly placed 4-colored blocks in rows 6-8 (positions ~8-10 and ~13-15) where expected has 1's; also placed extra 4's in rows 11-13 third block where expected has 4's but mismatched prior (actually, rows 11-13 third block is correct as 4's, but rows 6-8 wrong color suggests anchor mismatch—likely picked a 4-based anchor instead of 1-based, or wrong ki assignment; rows 16-18 correctly placed 1's, but overall incomplete as lower empty rows stayed empty correctly).
 * What worked: Background detection (8 in train1, 3 in test); run extraction for anchors; subsequence matching to keys; basic placement without overwriting; stepping logic positioned blocks vertically correctly in passing cases (e.g., delta-based row calc).
 * What didn't: Anchor selection suboptimal (chose wrong h/s/ki in train1, leading to color swap 4->1 error); block extension in placement loop caps at min(len(temp_starts), m) but may not pad correctly for short anchors/long keys; key_colors exclude 8 (helped train1 but unclear if general); no handling for non-uniform block widths or single-block diffs; program returns copy if no anchor/keys, which is safe but misses non-anchor patterns.
 * extract_objects not present but implied via runs/keys—essential for identifying replicable blocks vs. static elements.
 * Subtle miss: In train1, expected has isolated 1's in rows 1,3,5 (cols 1,3) not replicated, showing only multi-row repeating runs are anchors; generated preserved them but erred on replication color.
 * Overall understanding: Core replication via keys/anchors grasped (passes 2/3 trains), but edge cases like multiple possible anchors or color-specific matching fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects bg=3; preserves existing patterns (e.g., row 0 all 3's, row 7 has isolated 8 at col1 untouched); replicates horizontal blocks like 1's/4's/2's in rows 1-4 and 10-13,17-20 using apparent stepping (e.g., 4-high blocks at cols ~13-16 and ~18-21, matching key-like sequences); extends to 4 blocks in some rows (e.g., row 17 adds 1's at end).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 5 has partial fills (1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) that seem like over-placement or wrong extension (expected likely preserves isolated or non-repeating as-is, without filling bg between); rows 6-9 and 14-16 are mostly empty but generated fills row 5 oddly; third block in rows 17-20 is 4's where input has none, but adds extra 1's at cols 23-26 which may overrun or mismatch subsequence (input row 17 has 1's only in first two blocks); isolated 8 in row7 col1 is preserved but not replicated (correct, as non-run); overall, stepping seems asymmetric (down more filled than up), and no replication in upper/lower empties suggests missed anchors—likely wrong anchor picked (e.g., 4-high 1/4/2 seq from rows1-4 as anchor, but misextended for lower keys including the 8? which is excluded); differs from expected by adding unrequested blocks (e.g., extra 1's) and partial row5, indicating subsequence or diff calc error for longer keys.

[2025-10-03 10:18:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of integers (colors/pixels) where the goal is to detect a background color, identify "key" rows and columns with non-background indicators, extract a small key pattern from their intersections, determine a block scale from run lengths, and then "reveal" or fill a larger logo pattern by placing scaled blocks of colors from the key matrix into the grid at aligned positions, overwriting background cells while preserving existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (B) is the most common color in the flattened grid; everything else is a signal or part of the pattern.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (starting from 1, up to min(10, n)) that contain at least one non-B cell in the top min(8, n) rows— this acts as vertical "keys" or anchors for the pattern.
 * Key rows are those (up to top 8) that have at least one non-B in the key columns; the key matrix is extracted solely from intersections of key rows and key columns, forming an m x k color grid (often small, like 3x3).
 * Scale (s) is the maximum horizontal run of consecutive identical non-B cells in any row, used as the width (and sometimes height proxy) for logo blocks.
 * Block starts are horizontal positions where full s-length runs of non-B start across multiple rows; spacing between blocks is derived from differences in these starts (s + empty gaps).
 * Vertical placement: Align blocks to key rows' positions, but shift based on a "filled" index (matching key colors to existing blocks) and spacing; height (h) is derived from the vertical span of the first detected block.
 * Subtlety: Only fill background (B) cells; do not overwrite existing non-B cells. Protection rules skip filling in top/bottom borders if s==2 and B==8 (likely to avoid UI elements or frames).
 * Subtlety: If multiple block starts, use their differences for empty spacing; default to 1 if only one. Block starts may truncate if they exceed grid width.
 * Subtlety: "i_filled" is the highest key row index matching an existing block's color, used to anchor vertical shifts; r_starts are offset from the filled block's row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction is limited to top 8 rows/10 cols, even if grid is larger (e.g., 23x23 in examples); patterns may have side indicators (like vertical stripes in cols 1,3) that are not part of the main logo.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must be solid (all cells in the h x s rectangle match the color) in existing grid to validate; invalid blocks are skipped.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal block detection skips over B runs and only considers non-B runs of at least s.
 * Considerations: Grids can be 23x23 (training) or 27x27 (test); colors vary (1-8, B=8 or 3); patterns may have irregular heights or partial fills; multiple blocks per row/column.
 * All attempts assume logo is placed in a grid-aligned, spaced manner, but fail on vertical alignment or skipping invalid placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies B, used in all attempts and works across examples.)

```python
def get_key_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    key_cols = []
    for c in range(1, min(10, n), 2):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for r in range(min(8, n))):
            key_cols.append(c)
    return key_cols
```
(This identifies odd-indexed key columns with signals in top rows; helpful for anchoring, works in train3.)

```python
def get_key_rows(g: List[List[int]], B: int, key_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rows = set()
    for r in range(min(8, len(g))):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for c in key_cols):
            rows.add(r)
    return sorted(rows)
```
(This finds key rows based on key cols; essential for extracting the key matrix, accurate in examples.)

```python
def get_key_colors(g: List[List[int]], key_rows: List[int], key_cols: List[int], B: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    m = len(key_rows)
    k = len(key_cols)
    kc = [[B] * k for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        r = key_rows[i]
        for j in range(k):
            kc[i][j] = g[r][key_cols[j]]
    return kc
```
(This extracts the m x k key pattern; core to getting colors for filling, works but ignores B in key if present.)

```python
def get_scale(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> int:
    max_s = 1
    for row in g:
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == B:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_color = row[i]
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == start_color:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if length > max_s:
                max_s = length
            i = j
    return max_s
```
(This finds max non-B run length for block width s; helpful, but may overfit if runs vary; works for train3.)

```python
def get_main_start_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = set()
    for r in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i <= n - s:
            if all(g[r][c] == g[r][i] != B for c in range(i, i + s)):
                starts.add(i)
            j = i
            while j < n and g[r][j] == g[r][i]:
                j += 1
            i = j
    return sorted(list(starts))
```
(This detects horizontal start positions for s-length non-B runs; useful for horizontal spacing, but buggy as it adds starts even if not full blocks vertically.)

```python
def get_block_info(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, start_c: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    present_rows = []
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == g[r][start_c] != B for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            present_rows.append(r)
    if not present_rows:
        return None
    min_r = min(present_rows)
    max_r = max(present_rows)
    color = g[min_r][start_c]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        if not all(g[r][c] == color for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            return None
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    return (min_r, h, color)
```
(This validates vertical blocks at a start col, returning position, height, color if solid; helpful for detecting existing filled blocks, key to anchoring.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects B, key rows/cols, and key colors in all cases, as seen in partial matches.
 * Worked well for train3 (fully correct), indicating core logic for spacing, scaling, and filling aligns sometimes when patterns are simple/aligned.
 * Failed train1: Generated extra 4's in row1 cols18-20 (not in expected, which has empty there); placed 1's in rows16-18 cols8-10 but expected has them empty (only side indicators); missed aligning lower 1's blocks to match expected positions in rows11-13 and16-18; overfilled some areas ignoring protection.
 * Failed train2: Missed placing 1's block in rows7-8 cols10-14 (expected has it, but generated only has side 1's and 3's); duplicated 3's in rows10-13 cols16-17 but expected has them only lower; failed to shift vertical placements correctly for middle rows; extra empty rows unfilled.
 * get_main_start_cols is helpful but buggy—adds starts per row without requiring vertical consistency, leading to incorrect spacing (e.g., assumes too many starts in train1/2).
 * get_block_info is essential and mostly correct, but skips invalid blocks; in train1/2, it under-detects filled blocks, causing wrong i_filled (defaults to 0, misaligning r_starts).
 * Protection logic (skip top/bottom if s==2 and B==8) is unhelpful/broken for train1 (B=8, s likely 3, but still overfills borders); not triggered in train2 (B=8? wait, train2 seems B=8, but no protection applied correctly).
 * Vertical shifting via i_filled and r_starts works in train3 but fails in train1/2 due to poor matching of key colors to blocks (uses max possible_i, but misses color consistency across h).
 * Horizontal block_starts truncate correctly but spacing (s + empty) assumes uniform gaps; in train1, diff-based empty=1? leads to overlaps/misplacements.
 * Overall, attempt understands extraction and scaling but mishandles vertical alignment and validation, causing partial/overfills in complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies B=3, extracts keys (e.g., fills 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16,20-23 matching input hints), places scaled blocks (s likely 4, seen in 4x4 fills of 1,4,2), and uses spacing ~4+3=7 (e.g., blocks at cols13-16,20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overwrites/adds 8's in rows20-23 cols13-16 (input has empty 3's, but 8 may be invalid color for this grid—B=3, 8 seems out of place); misses filling some hinted areas like row3 col5=2 (remains isolated, not expanded to block); row5 col3=4 not expanded vertically/horizontally to match key; extra 1's in row5 col13-16 but input already has them, and it doesn't align all key rows (e.g., lower keys in rows15-18,20-23 partially filled but shifted wrong, adding 1's in row19? wait, row15-18 has 1's and 4's but expected likely needs consistent h=4 blocks); side indicators (cols1,3,5) preserved but logo blocks seem misaligned vertically (e.g., row20-23 8's block doesn't match any key color pattern).
 * Fills bottom rows20-23 with 8's block, but input has no such hint there—likely wrong color from key mismatch or invalid extraction; upper rows0-3 side fills (1,4,2) not blocked properly.
 * To handle test: Need better block validation (require full h consistency before filling), correct i_filled to min/max instead of max, and ignore/exclude B=3 in key_colors properly; spacing may need vertical detection too.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

    return tracks
```
(Extracts valid signal tracks: odd columns with only single isolated non-bg cells; essential for identifying signal columns.)

                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(Collects unique horizontal block positions (width >=2); useful for detecting patterns but note: doesn't capture colors or verticality directly—pair with other funcs.)

            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving detection and replication of horizontal block patterns (anchors) across multiple rows, guided by "key" sequences extracted from specific rows and columns, to fill in missing or implied parts of the grid while preserving the background and avoiding overwriting existing non-background elements. The goal is to identify repeating block structures and propagate them vertically using patterned stepping, matching color sequences from keys to ensure correct placement.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common color; all placements must respect it by only overwriting bg cells, never existing non-bg cells.
 * Horizontal runs are sequences of identical non-bg cells of length >=2; anchors require identical run starts, lengths (>=2), and colors repeating for at least h=2 consecutive rows.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (1,3,5,7,9) with any non-bg in the first 8 rows; key rows are those with non-bg in key columns (first 8 rows); key colors are non-bg, non-8 values from key row-key col intersections, forming per-row color lists that act as sequence guides.
 * Anchor selection prioritizes tallest h, then earliest start row s, and requires block colors to be a subsequence of some key color list; spacing (diff) between blocks is derived from starts or defaults to w+2 if single block.
 * Placement for other keys uses delta-based stepping: step_down=2*h-1 for below, step_up=2*h+1 for above; extend block starts rightward using anchor_diff if key sequence is longer than anchor blocks.
 * Subtle: Exclude color 8 from keys (possibly a special marker or invalid for replication); single-block anchors use w+2 as diff; only place if target row range fits grid; subsequence matching allows partial embeds (e.g., anchor colors subset of key).
 * Grids may have size >8 (up to 27x27 in test), but keys limited to first 8 rows/cols; patterns may not span full width; replication only for matching subsequences, skipping if out-of-bounds or no match.
 * Potential misses: Wrong anchor selection (e.g., picking a shorter/wrong-color repeat); incorrect stepping leading to overlap or misplacement; failing to extend blocks for longer keys; not handling isolated non-repeating patterns.
 * All attempts assume rectangular grid input/output; preserve existing non-bg (only fill bg).

            if out[r][c] == bg:
                out[r][c] = col
```
(Note: get_key_cols, get_key_rows, get_key_colors, find_anchor are helpful but buggy in current form—e.g., find_anchor has return tuple mismatch and incomplete extension logic; use as base but fix.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The current find_anchor: Broken return (appends extra h, slices to 6 but expects 7); assumes uniform w across blocks (fails if varied); diff calculation assumes >=2 blocks or defaults poorly; doesn't handle multiple possible anchors well (picks by h then s, but may miss best subsequence match).
 * get_key_colors: Excludes 8 arbitrarily (works for train1 bg=8 but may be puzzle rule); filters only key_cols but ignores full row context.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) passed training examples 2 and 3 fully (correct outputs match expected, demonstrating core anchor detection, key extraction, and stepping work for those cases).
 * Failed training example 1: Generated output incorrectly placed 4-colored blocks in rows 6-8 (positions ~8-10 and ~13-15) where expected has 1's; also placed extra 4's in rows 11-13 third block where expected has 4's but mismatched prior (actually, rows 11-13 third block is correct as 4's, but rows 6-8 wrong color suggests anchor mismatch—likely picked a 4-based anchor instead of 1-based, or wrong ki assignment; rows 16-18 correctly placed 1's, but overall incomplete as lower empty rows stayed empty correctly).
 * What worked: Background detection (8 in train1, 3 in test); run extraction for anchors; subsequence matching to keys; basic placement without overwriting; stepping logic positioned blocks vertically correctly in passing cases (e.g., delta-based row calc).
 * What didn't: Anchor selection suboptimal (chose wrong h/s/ki in train1, leading to color swap 4->1 error); block extension in placement loop caps at min(len(temp_starts), m) but may not pad correctly for short anchors/long keys; key_colors exclude 8 (helped train1 but unclear if general); no handling for non-uniform block widths or single-block diffs; program returns copy if no anchor/keys, which is safe but misses non-anchor patterns.
 * extract_objects not present but implied via runs/keys—essential for identifying replicable blocks vs. static elements.
 * Subtle miss: In train1, expected has isolated 1's in rows 1,3,5 (cols 1,3) not replicated, showing only multi-row repeating runs are anchors; generated preserved them but erred on replication color.
 * Overall understanding: Core replication via keys/anchors grasped (passes 2/3 trains), but edge cases like multiple possible anchors or color-specific matching fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects bg=3; preserves existing patterns (e.g., row 0 all 3's, row 7 has isolated 8 at col1 untouched); replicates horizontal blocks like 1's/4's/2's in rows 1-4 and 10-13,17-20 using apparent stepping (e.g., 4-high blocks at cols ~13-16 and ~18-21, matching key-like sequences); extends to 4 blocks in some rows (e.g., row 17 adds 1's at end).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 5 has partial fills (1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) that seem like over-placement or wrong extension (expected likely preserves isolated or non-repeating as-is, without filling bg between); rows 6-9 and 14-16 are mostly empty but generated fills row 5 oddly; third block in rows 17-20 is 4's where input has none, but adds extra 1's at cols 23-26 which may overrun or mismatch subsequence (input row 17 has 1's only in first two blocks); isolated 8 in row7 col1 is preserved but not replicated (correct, as non-run); overall, stepping seems asymmetric (down more filled than up), and no replication in upper/lower empties suggests missed anchors—likely wrong anchor picked (e.g., 4-high 1/4/2 seq from rows1-4 as anchor, but misextended for lower keys including the 8? which is excluded); differs from expected by adding unrequested blocks (e.g., extra 1's) and partial row5, indicating subsequence or diff calc error for longer keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid represents a pattern with a background color, vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns) containing isolated signal colors, and horizontal "blocks" (consecutive cells of the same non-background color, at least 2 wide) that need to be detected, anchored, and extended or placed vertically to match subsequences of signal colors across multiple rows. The goal is to generate an output grid that completes or replicates these block patterns at relative positions based on an anchor point, filling only background areas without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the most common or uniform row color (e.g., 3), but must be reliably detected even if not all rows are uniform.
 * Tracks are specifically odd-indexed columns (j in range(1, size, 2)) that contain at least one non-background cell, but only qualify if all non-background cells are isolated (max consecutive == 1), indicating "signals" rather than blocks.
 * Signal rows are those with any non-background in tracks; signal colors are the list of non-background values in those tracks per row, in track order.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of the same non-background color (>=2 wide) across any row; all detected blocks must have uniform width (h) for anchoring to work, otherwise fall back to default placement.
 * Anchoring requires finding a starting row s where a vertical stack of h rows has uniform horizontal blocks matching the positions/sizes in block_ranges, and their colors form a subsequence of one signal_colors list (using is_subsequence check); this anchor_k identifies which signal to "root" placements to.
 * Placements extend blocks forward/backward from anchor using steps (e.g., 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and differences from existing ranges; only fill background cells, and limit to grid bounds.
 * If no blocks or no anchor found, default to h=2, centered horizontal placements with fixed spacing (diff_start=2*h+1, vertical step=2*h+1), starting from grid center.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., block colors can be a subset of signal colors in order); placements can overlap or extend partial blocks but shouldn't overwrite non-bg; vertical positioning uses delta * step, with forward/backward steps differing to avoid overlap; isolated signals (max_consec=1) distinguish tracks from potential vertical blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty signals return input unchanged; non-uniform block widths or invalid anchors trigger default mode; bounds checking prevents out-of-grid placements; multiple signals per row possible, but colors list per signal_row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure block detection scans all rows but deduplicates ranges by position; vertical uniformity check in anchor must verify entire block rectangle is same color; default mode assumes symmetric centering but may not fit odd-sized grids perfectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    if size == 0:
        return 0
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(This reliably detects uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for grids with mixed rows.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                has_signal = True
                consec += 1
                max_consec = max(max_consec, consec)
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(Key for identifying signal tracks; enforces isolation to avoid mistaking vertical blocks for signals.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Essential for matching block color sequences to signal colors; allows skipping in b for partial fits.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            color = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == color:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(Extracts unique horizontal block positions/sizes; deduplicates to find consistent patterns across rows.)

```python
def find_anchor(g: List[List[int]], block_ranges: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, signal_colors: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # (Full function body as in program; checks vertical uniformity and subsequence match)
```
(Core for locating anchor; verifies full rectangular uniformity, which is subtle and easy to miss.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * extend_ranges and place_blocks: These are implementation helpers but can over-extend beyond grid or place on non-bg if not careful (e.g., no overwrite check in place_blocks beyond bg==3); they're functional but brittle for varying sizes.
 * The default placement logic in program (when no blocks/anchor): Assumes fixed h=2 and centering, which works for training but may not generalize to test if input expects different h or asymmetry; it's a fallback but overrides custom block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchoring/placement logic.
 * Worked well: Uniform background detection, isolated signal filtering in tracks, subsequence matching for anchors, and relative placement with steps (forward/backward differentiation avoids overlap in training).
 * Did not work/partial issues: In default mode (no blocks), fixed spacing (e.g., diff_start=2*h+1) may not align with input patterns if test has asymmetric or wider defaults; anchor search assumes blocks exist in exact range positions vertically, which could miss partial or shifted anchors.
 * Block width uniformity check is strict (len(widths)!=1 returns copy), which is good for consistency but may fail tests with mixed widths (fallback to default helps but isn't adaptive).
 * No explicit handling for multiple block sets per row or vertical signals misidentified as tracks (but max_consec=1 prevents most).
 * Training successes suggest extract-like functions (get_tracks, get_signal_colors, get_block_ranges) are essential for decomposing the grid into signals vs. blocks.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt demonstrates progressive logic (detect -> extract -> anchor -> place), which is helpful for future refinements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (27x27 grid, bg=3) shows partial placements: e.g., row 1 has isolated 1's in positions ~1,3,5 (possibly misplaced signals) and a block of four 1's starting ~13, then another at ~18-21 and ~23-26; row 3 has similar but with 4's and a 2; rows 10-13 have vertical stacks of four 4's (~13-16) and four 2's (~18-21,23-26); rows 17-20 mirror with 1's and four 4's.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely complete symmetric horizontal blocks across full h-height vertical stacks matching all signal_colors subsequences, but here placements are inconsistent—e.g., row 1 has singles (not blocks >=2), row 2/4/5 are mostly bg with trailing 1's (partial fills?), and upper rows (0,6-9) are all bg (possibly no signals there). Lower blocks (rows 10-13,17-20) look like proper 4-high stacks, but spacing/diffs seem off (e.g., 4's and 2's blocks are adjacent without expected gaps like 2*h+1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input had partial anchors or signals in odd columns, output should extend uniformly without isolated cells (e.g., row1 singles suggest failed block placement or track misdetection); vertical stacks are present but may not match all signal rows (e.g., no clear anchor in upper half); many rows remain all-bg, indicating skipped placements due to bounds or delta*step overflow (size=27, steps~5 for h=2 could skip). Unknown why upper signals (1,4,2) didn't form full blocks—possibly anchor not found, triggering partial default.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense (some block completions) but appears incomplete/inaccurate, missing full pattern replication (e.g., no forward/backward extensions from a clear anchor; irregularities like non-uniform heights).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or signals on a background, where the task is to detect sparse "signals" in vertical tracks and use them to identify and extend uniform colored block patterns across the grid, anchoring from an existing block structure and propagating it to match signal sequences in other rows. The goal is to fill in missing blocks while preserving existing content and ensuring blocks are uniform rectangles that align with signal colors as subsequences.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color, often 3 in examples; all uniform rows help confirm it, but fall back to top-left if no full uniform row.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals—defined as having at least one non-bg cell, but crucially only those where non-bg cells are isolated (max consecutive non-bg == 1, no clumps).
 * Signals are rows with non-bg cells in tracks; collect unique such rows, sort them, and extract non-bg colors from tracks in those rows (excluding 8, which may be a special/noise value).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ consecutive identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start, end) ranges across the grid.
 * Anchor detection: Search for a rectangular block structure (height h >=2, starting at row s) where blocks are uniform color across height, all blocks same width w, positions match a sorted list of block ranges, and the sequence of block colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors.
 * Extension: Once anchored, propagate to other signal rows by calculating row positions with forward/backward steps (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward), extending block ranges rightward if needed (with fixed gap between blocks), and placing only on bg cells.
 * Fallback if no anchor: Use default h=2, w=2, start blocks at center, step backward from bottom, extend ranges, place blocks— but this seems less precise and may overlap or misalign.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., blocks match a subset); only place on bg to avoid overwriting; ensure extended ranges don't exceed grid size; gap between blocks is derived from anchor (end1 +1 + gap = start2); signals may have varying numbers of colors, so extend blocks to match; isolated signals (max_consec=1) define tracks, but blocks can be wider; 8 is ignored in signal colors, possibly a delimiter or invalid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no signals returns copy; anchor search starts from larger h downward, left-to-right s; if multiple anchors possible, takes first found; propagation skips invalid positions (out of bounds); in fallback, starts from bottom and steps up (negative direction).
 * All existing non-bg must be preserved unless overwritten logically, but code only overwrites bg; block colors must exactly match signal colors in order.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchor-based propagation.
 * Anchor finding with subsequence matching worked well for trainings, allowing flexible pattern extension without requiring exact sequence matches.
 * Fallback logic (default blocks from bottom) was not triggered in trainings (since anchors found), but ensures something is placed if no anchor.
 * get_tracks enforces isolated signals (max_consec=1), which is crucial and worked; without it, clumped columns might be misidentified.
 * place_blocks only overwrites bg, preserving existing non-bg, which is correct and prevented overwriting in trainings.
 * extend_block_ranges correctly adds blocks rightward with fixed gap and width, handling varying signal lengths.
 * No major misses in trainings, but search for anchor starts from larger h downward and left s, which may prefer certain patterns; step calculations (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) seem empirically tuned for spacing between signal rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows placements in rows 10-13 (4-wide blocks of 4 at cols 13-16, 2 at 18-21), rows 17-20 (4-wide 1 at 13-16, 4 at 18-21, 1 at 23-26), and scattered signals in upper rows (e.g., row1: 1s at cols1,3,13-16,18-21,23-26; row3 similar), with some existing patterns like row3 cols13-16=1s preserved/modified minimally.
 * It looks partially correct: blocks are uniform rectangles matching apparent signal colors (e.g., 4s and 2s in lower, 1s and 4s in mid-lower), placed on bg=3 without overwriting, and aligned to even-ish columns suggesting track influence; spacing/gaps seem consistent (e.g., gap=1 between block groups).
 * However, upper signals (rows 1-5) have placements like isolated 1/4/2 in even cols (0,2,5?), but code targets odd tracks— this may be existing input not extended, or fallback/misplacement; row6 has 1/4/1 but no block extension visible, suggesting propagation skipped invalid positions.
 * Lower blocks (rows10-13,17-20) match multi-color signals (e.g., [4,2] subsequence for row10+), but row14-16 are all bg—no placement, possibly no matching signal or out-of-bounds; overall, it makes sense as an extension but may miss forward propagation from anchor (if anchor in upper/mid) or undetect some tracks (e.g., col5 has signals but no blocks there).
 * Existing input has vertical alignments (e.g., cols13-16 have 1s in rows2-5, then 4s lower), and output extends horizontally into blocks, which aligns with rules; no obvious errors like overwriting non-bg or mismatched colors, but subtle issue: signal rows include row7? (all bg, skipped correctly), and 8 in row7 col1 ignored properly.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 10:36:37] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 2D grid (likely representing a pixel art or pattern completion task) needs to be completed by filling background cells (most common color, e.g., 8 or 3) with colored rectangular blocks. The blocks are inferred from vertical "tracks" (odd-indexed columns with isolated non-background signals), horizontal runs of colors in signal rows, and propagating uniform block templates (of consistent height h and width w) forward/backward across the grid using specific step sizes and gaps, with a fallback mode for simple linear filling if no template is detected.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent color; non-bg cells in odd columns (tracks) must have isolated signals (max consecutive non-bg of 1 per column) to qualify as valid tracks—columns with longer runs or no signals are ignored.
 * Signal rows (srows) are rows with non-bg colors in tracks, but filter out color 8 (possibly a special/noise value); collect per-row color sequences from tracks as "sig_colors" lists, which form subsequences for matching block color patterns.
 * Block detection searches for horizontal templates: uniform rectangular blocks (height ph from 2 to n, width w from runs >=2 in a starting row sr) with consistent colors across height; the block's color sequence must be a subsequence of some sig_colors entry.
 * Propagation uses asymmetric steps: forward step_f = 2*h -1, backward step_b = 2*h +1; horizontal spacing via horiz_diff = 2*w -1, gap = horiz_diff - w; adjust template starts by extending/contracting based on color list lengths, and skip if out of bounds.
 * Subtlety: When propagating, d_step varies—if current num_b > next/prev len, use h, else use step_f/step_b; only fill bg cells (don't overwrite existing).
 * Extra forward pass if trailing sig_colors have uniform lengths: repeat last colors with step_f.
 * Fallback if no template found: fixed h=2, w=2, horiz_diff=5, step_f=5, starts at n//2, s=min(8,n)+h, linear forward filling with extensions; extra forward if all sig_colors same length.
 * Easy to miss: is_subsequence allows non-consecutive matching (e.g., [1,4] matches if 1 then later 4 in sig_colors); runs only consider >=2 length; uniform check requires exact color match across entire block height/width.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 23x23); outputs copy of input with fills.
 * Considerations: Overfilling (e.g., placing blocks where expected is bg) due to fallback triggering incorrectly; missing propagation direction or step miscalculation leads to gaps; subsequence matching may align wrong if multiple similar sig_colors.

        if i < len(sub) and val == sub[i]:

    runs = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        colr = row[i]
        while i < n and row[i] == colr:

        leng = i - start
        if leng >= 2:
            runs.append((start, leng, colr))
    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies bg, tracks, and sig_colors in all cases, and the template search with run-based uniform blocks works for train3 (exact match via propagation).
 * Worked: is_subsequence and find_runs enable accurate color matching and run detection; fallback partially handles linear patterns but overfills in train1/2.
 * Didn't work: Template search failed to find/align blocks in train1/2, triggering fallback which placed extra 1's in rows 16-18 of train1 (where expected all 8's) and extra 3's in rows 10/14 of train2 (expected 3's only in rows 10-11 and 13-14, but positions mismatched—generated row10 has 1's+3's but expected all 8's for row10? Wait, row indexing: generated overpropagated downward).
 * In train1, generated matches expected in upper/mid but adds unauthorized 1-blocks in lower empty areas (rows 16-18 cols 8-10/13-15), likely fallback misplacement.
 * In train2, generated adds extra 3's in row10 cols16-17 (expected all 8's there) and duplicates in row14 (expected has 3's but shifted?); misses vertical alignment for 3's in rows13-14.
 * Fallback is helpful for simple cases (train3) but broken for complex—overextends with fixed h=2/w=2/step=5, ignoring actual patterns, leading to irrelevant fills.
 * get_tracks is essential and correct (filters isolated signals well); get_valid_srows_and_colors useful but filters color=8 too aggressively (may miss if 8 is valid signal).
 * Propagation logic subtle but flawed: backward loop uses kk-1 to 0 but starts from found s, may skip/underfill; forward extra only if uniform lengths, but in train1/2 lengths vary (e.g., train1 sig_colors likely [4],[4],[4,4,4],[1,1,1] varying).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but fallback block is not helpful (causes overfill; avoid or condition better).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves most bg=3 intact, fills isolated vertical signals (cols1,3,5 with 1/4/2) without extension, and attempts block fills like 1's in rows1-4 cols13-16/18-21 (matching a 4x4 pattern), 4's+2's in rows10-13 cols13-16/18-21, and 1's+4's in rows17-20 cols13-16/18-21, suggesting propagation from detected templates.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: upper fills (rows1-4) overwrite existing non-bg (e.g., row3 col5=2 remains but nearby 1's added; expected likely preserves isolated signals without merging). Lower fills (rows17-20) add 1's+4's where input has none, but input row17 all 3's—propagation may overextend if steps miscalculated (e.g., from row11-14 4/2 blocks, step_f=3? leads to row18ish). Misses potential backward fill from row5-6 1/4 signals. Extra 8 in row7 col1 seems erroneous (input 8? but bg=3, possibly noise). Overall, blocks align to tracks but heights/positions don't match input patterns (e.g., row11-14 should propagate 4/2 without changing to 1/4 below); likely fallback or wrong h=4 triggered incorrectly.
 * To handle test: Ensure template search starts from actual signal rows (e.g., row0-6,10-14,17-20); adjust steps for bg=3 grids (n=27? wider); verify subsequence matches don't skip varying lengths like [1,1,1,1] to [4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2].

[2025-10-03 10:36:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of integers (colors/pixels) where the goal is to detect a background color, identify "key" rows and columns with non-background indicators, extract a small key pattern from their intersections, determine a block scale from run lengths, and then "reveal" or fill a larger logo pattern by placing scaled blocks of colors from the key matrix into the grid at aligned positions, overwriting background cells while preserving existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (B) is the most common color in the flattened grid; everything else is a signal or part of the pattern.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (starting from 1, up to min(10, n)) that contain at least one non-B cell in the top min(8, n) rows— this acts as vertical "keys" or anchors for the pattern.
 * Key rows are those (up to top 8) that have at least one non-B in the key columns; the key matrix is extracted solely from intersections of key rows and key columns, forming an m x k color grid (often small, like 3x3).
 * Scale (s) is the maximum horizontal run of consecutive identical non-B cells in any row, used as the width (and sometimes height proxy) for logo blocks.
 * Block starts are horizontal positions where full s-length runs of non-B start across multiple rows; spacing between blocks is derived from differences in these starts (s + empty gaps).
 * Vertical placement: Align blocks to key rows' positions, but shift based on a "filled" index (matching key colors to existing blocks) and spacing; height (h) is derived from the vertical span of the first detected block.
 * Subtlety: Only fill background (B) cells; do not overwrite existing non-B cells. Protection rules skip filling in top/bottom borders if s==2 and B==8 (likely to avoid UI elements or frames).
 * Subtlety: If multiple block starts, use their differences for empty spacing; default to 1 if only one. Block starts may truncate if they exceed grid width.
 * Subtlety: "i_filled" is the highest key row index matching an existing block's color, used to anchor vertical shifts; r_starts are offset from the filled block's row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction is limited to top 8 rows/10 cols, even if grid is larger (e.g., 23x23 in examples); patterns may have side indicators (like vertical stripes in cols 1,3) that are not part of the main logo.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must be solid (all cells in the h x s rectangle match the color) in existing grid to validate; invalid blocks are skipped.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal block detection skips over B runs and only considers non-B runs of at least s.
 * Considerations: Grids can be 23x23 (training) or 27x27 (test); colors vary (1-8, B=8 or 3); patterns may have irregular heights or partial fills; multiple blocks per row/column.
 * All attempts assume logo is placed in a grid-aligned, spaced manner, but fail on vertical alignment or skipping invalid placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies B, used in all attempts and works across examples.)

```python
def get_key_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    key_cols = []
    for c in range(1, min(10, n), 2):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for r in range(min(8, n))):
            key_cols.append(c)
    return key_cols
```
(This identifies odd-indexed key columns with signals in top rows; helpful for anchoring, works in train3.)

```python
def get_key_rows(g: List[List[int]], B: int, key_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rows = set()
    for r in range(min(8, len(g))):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for c in key_cols):
            rows.add(r)
    return sorted(rows)
```
(This finds key rows based on key cols; essential for extracting the key matrix, accurate in examples.)

```python
def get_key_colors(g: List[List[int]], key_rows: List[int], key_cols: List[int], B: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    m = len(key_rows)
    k = len(key_cols)
    kc = [[B] * k for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        r = key_rows[i]
        for j in range(k):
            kc[i][j] = g[r][key_cols[j]]
    return kc
```
(This extracts the m x k key pattern; core to getting colors for filling, works but ignores B in key if present.)

```python
def get_scale(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> int:
    max_s = 1
    for row in g:
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == B:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_color = row[i]
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == start_color:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if length > max_s:
                max_s = length
            i = j
    return max_s
```
(This finds max non-B run length for block width s; helpful, but may overfit if runs vary; works for train3.)

```python
def get_main_start_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = set()
    for r in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i <= n - s:
            if all(g[r][c] == g[r][i] != B for c in range(i, i + s)):
                starts.add(i)
            j = i
            while j < n and g[r][j] == g[r][i]:
                j += 1
            i = j
    return sorted(list(starts))
```
(This detects horizontal start positions for s-length non-B runs; useful for horizontal spacing, but buggy as it adds starts even if not full blocks vertically.)

```python
def get_block_info(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, start_c: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    present_rows = []
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == g[r][start_c] != B for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            present_rows.append(r)
    if not present_rows:
        return None
    min_r = min(present_rows)
    max_r = max(present_rows)
    color = g[min_r][start_c]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        if not all(g[r][c] == color for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            return None
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    return (min_r, h, color)
```
(This validates vertical blocks at a start col, returning position, height, color if solid; helpful for detecting existing filled blocks, key to anchoring.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects B, key rows/cols, and key colors in all cases, as seen in partial matches.
 * Worked well for train3 (fully correct), indicating core logic for spacing, scaling, and filling aligns sometimes when patterns are simple/aligned.
 * Failed train1: Generated extra 4's in row1 cols18-20 (not in expected, which has empty there); placed 1's in rows16-18 cols8-10 but expected has them empty (only side indicators); missed aligning lower 1's blocks to match expected positions in rows11-13 and16-18; overfilled some areas ignoring protection.
 * Failed train2: Missed placing 1's block in rows7-8 cols10-14 (expected has it, but generated only has side 1's and 3's); duplicated 3's in rows10-13 cols16-17 but expected has them only lower; failed to shift vertical placements correctly for middle rows; extra empty rows unfilled.
 * get_main_start_cols is helpful but buggy—adds starts per row without requiring vertical consistency, leading to incorrect spacing (e.g., assumes too many starts in train1/2).
 * get_block_info is essential and mostly correct, but skips invalid blocks; in train1/2, it under-detects filled blocks, causing wrong i_filled (defaults to 0, misaligning r_starts).
 * Protection logic (skip top/bottom if s==2 and B==8) is unhelpful/broken for train1 (B=8, s likely 3, but still overfills borders); not triggered in train2 (B=8? wait, train2 seems B=8, but no protection applied correctly).
 * Vertical shifting via i_filled and r_starts works in train3 but fails in train1/2 due to poor matching of key colors to blocks (uses max possible_i, but misses color consistency across h).
 * Horizontal block_starts truncate correctly but spacing (s + empty) assumes uniform gaps; in train1, diff-based empty=1? leads to overlaps/misplacements.
 * Overall, attempt understands extraction and scaling but mishandles vertical alignment and validation, causing partial/overfills in complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies B=3, extracts keys (e.g., fills 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16,20-23 matching input hints), places scaled blocks (s likely 4, seen in 4x4 fills of 1,4,2), and uses spacing ~4+3=7 (e.g., blocks at cols13-16,20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overwrites/adds 8's in rows20-23 cols13-16 (input has empty 3's, but 8 may be invalid color for this grid—B=3, 8 seems out of place); misses filling some hinted areas like row3 col5=2 (remains isolated, not expanded to block); row5 col3=4 not expanded vertically/horizontally to match key; extra 1's in row5 col13-16 but input already has them, and it doesn't align all key rows (e.g., lower keys in rows15-18,20-23 partially filled but shifted wrong, adding 1's in row19? wait, row15-18 has 1's and 4's but expected likely needs consistent h=4 blocks); side indicators (cols1,3,5) preserved but logo blocks seem misaligned vertically (e.g., row20-23 8's block doesn't match any key color pattern).
 * Fills bottom rows20-23 with 8's block, but input has no such hint there—likely wrong color from key mismatch or invalid extraction; upper rows0-3 side fills (1,4,2) not blocked properly.
 * To handle test: Need better block validation (require full h consistency before filling), correct i_filled to min/max instead of max, and ignore/exclude B=3 in key_colors properly; spacing may need vertical detection too.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 2D grid (likely representing a pixel art or pattern completion task) needs to be completed by filling background cells (most common color, e.g., 8 or 3) with colored rectangular blocks. The blocks are inferred from vertical "tracks" (odd-indexed columns with isolated non-background signals), horizontal runs of colors in signal rows, and propagating uniform block templates (of consistent height h and width w) forward/backward across the grid using specific step sizes and gaps, with a fallback mode for simple linear filling if no template is detected.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent color; non-bg cells in odd columns (tracks) must have isolated signals (max consecutive non-bg of 1 per column) to qualify as valid tracks—columns with longer runs or no signals are ignored.
 * Signal rows (srows) are rows with non-bg colors in tracks, but filter out color 8 (possibly a special/noise value); collect per-row color sequences from tracks as "sig_colors" lists, which form subsequences for matching block color patterns.
 * Block detection searches for horizontal templates: uniform rectangular blocks (height ph from 2 to n, width w from runs >=2 in a starting row sr) with consistent colors across height; the block's color sequence must be a subsequence of some sig_colors entry.
 * Propagation uses asymmetric steps: forward step_f = 2*h -1, backward step_b = 2*h +1; horizontal spacing via horiz_diff = 2*w -1, gap = horiz_diff - w; adjust template starts by extending/contracting based on color list lengths, and skip if out of bounds.
 * Subtlety: When propagating, d_step varies—if current num_b > next/prev len, use h, else use step_f/step_b; only fill bg cells (don't overwrite existing).
 * Extra forward pass if trailing sig_colors have uniform lengths: repeat last colors with step_f.
 * Fallback if no template found: fixed h=2, w=2, horiz_diff=5, step_f=5, starts at n//2, s=min(8,n)+h, linear forward filling with extensions; extra forward if all sig_colors same length.
 * Easy to miss: is_subsequence allows non-consecutive matching (e.g., [1,4] matches if 1 then later 4 in sig_colors); runs only consider >=2 length; uniform check requires exact color match across entire block height/width.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 23x23); outputs copy of input with fills.
 * Considerations: Overfilling (e.g., placing blocks where expected is bg) due to fallback triggering incorrectly; missing propagation direction or step miscalculation leads to gaps; subsequence matching may align wrong if multiple similar sig_colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies bg, tracks, and sig_colors in all cases, and the template search with run-based uniform blocks works for train3 (exact match via propagation).
 * Worked: is_subsequence and find_runs enable accurate color matching and run detection; fallback partially handles linear patterns but overfills in train1/2.
 * Didn't work: Template search failed to find/align blocks in train1/2, triggering fallback which placed extra 1's in rows 16-18 of train1 (where expected all 8's) and extra 3's in rows 10/14 of train2 (expected 3's only in rows 10-11 and 13-14, but positions mismatched—generated row10 has 1's+3's but expected all 8's for row10? Wait, row indexing: generated overpropagated downward).
 * In train1, generated matches expected in upper/mid but adds unauthorized 1-blocks in lower empty areas (rows 16-18 cols 8-10/13-15), likely fallback misplacement.
 * In train2, generated adds extra 3's in row10 cols16-17 (expected all 8's there) and duplicates in row14 (expected has 3's but shifted?); misses vertical alignment for 3's in rows13-14.
 * Fallback is helpful for simple cases (train3) but broken for complex—overextends with fixed h=2/w=2/step=5, ignoring actual patterns, leading to irrelevant fills.
 * get_tracks is essential and correct (filters isolated signals well); get_valid_srows_and_colors useful but filters color=8 too aggressively (may miss if 8 is valid signal).
 * Propagation logic subtle but flawed: backward loop uses kk-1 to 0 but starts from found s, may skip/underfill; forward extra only if uniform lengths, but in train1/2 lengths vary (e.g., train1 sig_colors likely [4],[4],[4,4,4],[1,1,1] varying).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but fallback block is not helpful (causes overfill; avoid or condition better).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves most bg=3 intact, fills isolated vertical signals (cols1,3,5 with 1/4/2) without extension, and attempts block fills like 1's in rows1-4 cols13-16/18-21 (matching a 4x4 pattern), 4's+2's in rows10-13 cols13-16/18-21, and 1's+4's in rows17-20 cols13-16/18-21, suggesting propagation from detected templates.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: upper fills (rows1-4) overwrite existing non-bg (e.g., row3 col5=2 remains but nearby 1's added; expected likely preserves isolated signals without merging). Lower fills (rows17-20) add 1's+4's where input has none, but input row17 all 3's—propagation may overextend if steps miscalculated (e.g., from row11-14 4/2 blocks, step_f=3? leads to row18ish). Misses potential backward fill from row5-6 1/4 signals. Extra 8 in row7 col1 seems erroneous (input 8? but bg=3, possibly noise). Overall, blocks align to tracks but heights/positions don't match input patterns (e.g., row11-14 should propagate 4/2 without changing to 1/4 below); likely fallback or wrong h=4 triggered incorrectly.
 * To handle test: Ensure template search starts from actual signal rows (e.g., row0-6,10-14,17-20); adjust steps for bg=3 grids (n=27? wider); verify subsequence matches don't skip varying lengths like [1,1,1,1] to [4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2].

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg via frequency.)

```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step

```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving detection and replication of horizontal block patterns (anchors) across multiple rows, guided by "key" sequences extracted from specific rows and columns, to fill in missing or implied parts of the grid while preserving the background and avoiding overwriting existing non-background elements. The goal is to identify repeating block structures and propagate them vertically using patterned stepping, matching color sequences from keys to ensure correct placement.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common color; all placements must respect it by only overwriting bg cells, never existing non-bg cells.
 * Horizontal runs are sequences of identical non-bg cells of length >=2; anchors require identical run starts, lengths (>=2), and colors repeating for at least h=2 consecutive rows.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (1,3,5,7,9) with any non-bg in the first 8 rows; key rows are those with non-bg in key columns (first 8 rows); key colors are non-bg, non-8 values from key row-key col intersections, forming per-row color lists that act as sequence guides.
 * Anchor selection prioritizes tallest h, then earliest start row s, and requires block colors to be a subsequence of some key color list; spacing (diff) between blocks is derived from starts or defaults to w+2 if single block.
 * Placement for other keys uses delta-based stepping: step_down=2*h-1 for below, step_up=2*h+1 for above; extend block starts rightward using anchor_diff if key sequence is longer than anchor blocks.
 * Subtle: Exclude color 8 from keys (possibly a special marker or invalid for replication); single-block anchors use w+2 as diff; only place if target row range fits grid; subsequence matching allows partial embeds (e.g., anchor colors subset of key).
 * Grids may have size >8 (up to 27x27 in test), but keys limited to first 8 rows/cols; patterns may not span full width; replication only for matching subsequences, skipping if out-of-bounds or no match.
 * Potential misses: Wrong anchor selection (e.g., picking a shorter/wrong-color repeat); incorrect stepping leading to overlap or misplacement; failing to extend blocks for longer keys; not handling isolated non-repeating patterns.
 * All attempts assume rectangular grid input/output; preserve existing non-bg (only fill bg).

```
(Note: get_key_cols, get_key_rows, get_key_colors, find_anchor are helpful but buggy in current form—e.g., find_anchor has return tuple mismatch and incomplete extension logic; use as base but fix.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The current find_anchor: Broken return (appends extra h, slices to 6 but expects 7); assumes uniform w across blocks (fails if varied); diff calculation assumes >=2 blocks or defaults poorly; doesn't handle multiple possible anchors well (picks by h then s, but may miss best subsequence match).
 * get_key_colors: Excludes 8 arbitrarily (works for train1 bg=8 but may be puzzle rule); filters only key_cols but ignores full row context.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) passed training examples 2 and 3 fully (correct outputs match expected, demonstrating core anchor detection, key extraction, and stepping work for those cases).
 * Failed training example 1: Generated output incorrectly placed 4-colored blocks in rows 6-8 (positions ~8-10 and ~13-15) where expected has 1's; also placed extra 4's in rows 11-13 third block where expected has 4's but mismatched prior (actually, rows 11-13 third block is correct as 4's, but rows 6-8 wrong color suggests anchor mismatch—likely picked a 4-based anchor instead of 1-based, or wrong ki assignment; rows 16-18 correctly placed 1's, but overall incomplete as lower empty rows stayed empty correctly).
 * What worked: Background detection (8 in train1, 3 in test); run extraction for anchors; subsequence matching to keys; basic placement without overwriting; stepping logic positioned blocks vertically correctly in passing cases (e.g., delta-based row calc).
 * What didn't: Anchor selection suboptimal (chose wrong h/s/ki in train1, leading to color swap 4->1 error); block extension in placement loop caps at min(len(temp_starts), m) but may not pad correctly for short anchors/long keys; key_colors exclude 8 (helped train1 but unclear if general); no handling for non-uniform block widths or single-block diffs; program returns copy if no anchor/keys, which is safe but misses non-anchor patterns.
 * extract_objects not present but implied via runs/keys—essential for identifying replicable blocks vs. static elements.
 * Subtle miss: In train1, expected has isolated 1's in rows 1,3,5 (cols 1,3) not replicated, showing only multi-row repeating runs are anchors; generated preserved them but erred on replication color.
 * Overall understanding: Core replication via keys/anchors grasped (passes 2/3 trains), but edge cases like multiple possible anchors or color-specific matching fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects bg=3; preserves existing patterns (e.g., row 0 all 3's, row 7 has isolated 8 at col1 untouched); replicates horizontal blocks like 1's/4's/2's in rows 1-4 and 10-13,17-20 using apparent stepping (e.g., 4-high blocks at cols ~13-16 and ~18-21, matching key-like sequences); extends to 4 blocks in some rows (e.g., row 17 adds 1's at end).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 5 has partial fills (1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) that seem like over-placement or wrong extension (expected likely preserves isolated or non-repeating as-is, without filling bg between); rows 6-9 and 14-16 are mostly empty but generated fills row 5 oddly; third block in rows 17-20 is 4's where input has none, but adds extra 1's at cols 23-26 which may overrun or mismatch subsequence (input row 17 has 1's only in first two blocks); isolated 8 in row7 col1 is preserved but not replicated (correct, as non-run); overall, stepping seems asymmetric (down more filled than up), and no replication in upper/lower empties suggests missed anchors—likely wrong anchor picked (e.g., 4-high 1/4/2 seq from rows1-4 as anchor, but misextended for lower keys including the 8? which is excluded); differs from expected by adding unrequested blocks (e.g., extra 1's) and partial row5, indicating subsequence or diff calc error for longer keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

                    return s, kk
    return -1, -1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

```
(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid represents a pattern with a background color, vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns) containing isolated signal colors, and horizontal "blocks" (consecutive cells of the same non-background color, at least 2 wide) that need to be detected, anchored, and extended or placed vertically to match subsequences of signal colors across multiple rows. The goal is to generate an output grid that completes or replicates these block patterns at relative positions based on an anchor point, filling only background areas without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the most common or uniform row color (e.g., 3), but must be reliably detected even if not all rows are uniform.
 * Tracks are specifically odd-indexed columns (j in range(1, size, 2)) that contain at least one non-background cell, but only qualify if all non-background cells are isolated (max consecutive == 1), indicating "signals" rather than blocks.
 * Signal rows are those with any non-background in tracks; signal colors are the list of non-background values in those tracks per row, in track order.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of the same non-background color (>=2 wide) across any row; all detected blocks must have uniform width (h) for anchoring to work, otherwise fall back to default placement.
 * Anchoring requires finding a starting row s where a vertical stack of h rows has uniform horizontal blocks matching the positions/sizes in block_ranges, and their colors form a subsequence of one signal_colors list (using is_subsequence check); this anchor_k identifies which signal to "root" placements to.
 * Placements extend blocks forward/backward from anchor using steps (e.g., 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and differences from existing ranges; only fill background cells, and limit to grid bounds.
 * If no blocks or no anchor found, default to h=2, centered horizontal placements with fixed spacing (diff_start=2*h+1, vertical step=2*h+1), starting from grid center.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., block colors can be a subset of signal colors in order); placements can overlap or extend partial blocks but shouldn't overwrite non-bg; vertical positioning uses delta * step, with forward/backward steps differing to avoid overlap; isolated signals (max_consec=1) distinguish tracks from potential vertical blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty signals return input unchanged; non-uniform block widths or invalid anchors trigger default mode; bounds checking prevents out-of-grid placements; multiple signals per row possible, but colors list per signal_row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure block detection scans all rows but deduplicates ranges by position; vertical uniformity check in anchor must verify entire block rectangle is same color; default mode assumes symmetric centering but may not fit odd-sized grids perfectly.

```
(Core for locating anchor; verifies full rectangular uniformity, which is subtle and easy to miss.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * extend_ranges and place_blocks: These are implementation helpers but can over-extend beyond grid or place on non-bg if not careful (e.g., no overwrite check in place_blocks beyond bg==3); they're functional but brittle for varying sizes.
 * The default placement logic in program (when no blocks/anchor): Assumes fixed h=2 and centering, which works for training but may not generalize to test if input expects different h or asymmetry; it's a fallback but overrides custom block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchoring/placement logic.
 * Worked well: Uniform background detection, isolated signal filtering in tracks, subsequence matching for anchors, and relative placement with steps (forward/backward differentiation avoids overlap in training).
 * Did not work/partial issues: In default mode (no blocks), fixed spacing (e.g., diff_start=2*h+1) may not align with input patterns if test has asymmetric or wider defaults; anchor search assumes blocks exist in exact range positions vertically, which could miss partial or shifted anchors.
 * Block width uniformity check is strict (len(widths)!=1 returns copy), which is good for consistency but may fail tests with mixed widths (fallback to default helps but isn't adaptive).
 * No explicit handling for multiple block sets per row or vertical signals misidentified as tracks (but max_consec=1 prevents most).
 * Training successes suggest extract-like functions (get_tracks, get_signal_colors, get_block_ranges) are essential for decomposing the grid into signals vs. blocks.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt demonstrates progressive logic (detect -> extract -> anchor -> place), which is helpful for future refinements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (27x27 grid, bg=3) shows partial placements: e.g., row 1 has isolated 1's in positions ~1,3,5 (possibly misplaced signals) and a block of four 1's starting ~13, then another at ~18-21 and ~23-26; row 3 has similar but with 4's and a 2; rows 10-13 have vertical stacks of four 4's (~13-16) and four 2's (~18-21,23-26); rows 17-20 mirror with 1's and four 4's.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely complete symmetric horizontal blocks across full h-height vertical stacks matching all signal_colors subsequences, but here placements are inconsistent—e.g., row 1 has singles (not blocks >=2), row 2/4/5 are mostly bg with trailing 1's (partial fills?), and upper rows (0,6-9) are all bg (possibly no signals there). Lower blocks (rows 10-13,17-20) look like proper 4-high stacks, but spacing/diffs seem off (e.g., 4's and 2's blocks are adjacent without expected gaps like 2*h+1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input had partial anchors or signals in odd columns, output should extend uniformly without isolated cells (e.g., row1 singles suggest failed block placement or track misdetection); vertical stacks are present but may not match all signal rows (e.g., no clear anchor in upper half); many rows remain all-bg, indicating skipped placements due to bounds or delta*step overflow (size=27, steps~5 for h=2 could skip). Unknown why upper signals (1,4,2) didn't form full blocks—possibly anchor not found, triggering partial default.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense (some block completions) but appears incomplete/inaccurate, missing full pattern replication (e.g., no forward/backward extensions from a clear anchor; irregularities like non-uniform heights).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or signals on a background, where the task is to detect sparse "signals" in vertical tracks and use them to identify and extend uniform colored block patterns across the grid, anchoring from an existing block structure and propagating it to match signal sequences in other rows. The goal is to fill in missing blocks while preserving existing content and ensuring blocks are uniform rectangles that align with signal colors as subsequences.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color, often 3 in examples; all uniform rows help confirm it, but fall back to top-left if no full uniform row.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals—defined as having at least one non-bg cell, but crucially only those where non-bg cells are isolated (max consecutive non-bg == 1, no clumps).
 * Signals are rows with non-bg cells in tracks; collect unique such rows, sort them, and extract non-bg colors from tracks in those rows (excluding 8, which may be a special/noise value).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ consecutive identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start, end) ranges across the grid.
 * Anchor detection: Search for a rectangular block structure (height h >=2, starting at row s) where blocks are uniform color across height, all blocks same width w, positions match a sorted list of block ranges, and the sequence of block colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors.
 * Extension: Once anchored, propagate to other signal rows by calculating row positions with forward/backward steps (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward), extending block ranges rightward if needed (with fixed gap between blocks), and placing only on bg cells.
 * Fallback if no anchor: Use default h=2, w=2, start blocks at center, step backward from bottom, extend ranges, place blocks— but this seems less precise and may overlap or misalign.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., blocks match a subset); only place on bg to avoid overwriting; ensure extended ranges don't exceed grid size; gap between blocks is derived from anchor (end1 +1 + gap = start2); signals may have varying numbers of colors, so extend blocks to match; isolated signals (max_consec=1) define tracks, but blocks can be wider; 8 is ignored in signal colors, possibly a delimiter or invalid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no signals returns copy; anchor search starts from larger h downward, left-to-right s; if multiple anchors possible, takes first found; propagation skips invalid positions (out of bounds); in fallback, starts from bottom and steps up (negative direction).
 * All existing non-bg must be preserved unless overwritten logically, but code only overwrites bg; block colors must exactly match signal colors in order.

    # (Full implementation as in program; key is validating uniformity and subsequence match.)
    # ... (code as provided)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchor-based propagation.
 * Anchor finding with subsequence matching worked well for trainings, allowing flexible pattern extension without requiring exact sequence matches.
 * Fallback logic (default blocks from bottom) was not triggered in trainings (since anchors found), but ensures something is placed if no anchor.
 * get_tracks enforces isolated signals (max_consec=1), which is crucial and worked; without it, clumped columns might be misidentified.
 * place_blocks only overwrites bg, preserving existing non-bg, which is correct and prevented overwriting in trainings.
 * extend_block_ranges correctly adds blocks rightward with fixed gap and width, handling varying signal lengths.
 * No major misses in trainings, but search for anchor starts from larger h downward and left s, which may prefer certain patterns; step calculations (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) seem empirically tuned for spacing between signal rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows placements in rows 10-13 (4-wide blocks of 4 at cols 13-16, 2 at 18-21), rows 17-20 (4-wide 1 at 13-16, 4 at 18-21, 1 at 23-26), and scattered signals in upper rows (e.g., row1: 1s at cols1,3,13-16,18-21,23-26; row3 similar), with some existing patterns like row3 cols13-16=1s preserved/modified minimally.
 * It looks partially correct: blocks are uniform rectangles matching apparent signal colors (e.g., 4s and 2s in lower, 1s and 4s in mid-lower), placed on bg=3 without overwriting, and aligned to even-ish columns suggesting track influence; spacing/gaps seem consistent (e.g., gap=1 between block groups).
 * However, upper signals (rows 1-5) have placements like isolated 1/4/2 in even cols (0,2,5?), but code targets odd tracks— this may be existing input not extended, or fallback/misplacement; row6 has 1/4/1 but no block extension visible, suggesting propagation skipped invalid positions.
 * Lower blocks (rows10-13,17-20) match multi-color signals (e.g., [4,2] subsequence for row10+), but row14-16 are all bg—no placement, possibly no matching signal or out-of-bounds; overall, it makes sense as an extension but may miss forward propagation from anchor (if anchor in upper/mid) or undetect some tracks (e.g., col5 has signals but no blocks there).
 * Existing input has vertical alignments (e.g., cols13-16 have 1s in rows2-5, then 4s lower), and output extends horizontally into blocks, which aligns with rules; no obvious errors like overwriting non-bg or mismatched colors, but subtle issue: signal rows include row7? (all bg, skipped correctly), and 8 in row7 col1 ignored properly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 10:48:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with a dominant background color like 8 or 3), where the task is to detect and extend vertical stacks of uniform horizontal blocks based on "signals" in odd-numbered columns that act as sparse guides or tracks, while avoiding over-extension or duplication of patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common cell value; all operations ignore or skip it unless placing new blocks.
 * Identify "runs" as horizontal sequences of 2+ identical non-background cells in a row.
 * Detect the "best stack": the tallest (hh) vertical group of rows starting at ss, where each row has the same-width (ww >=2) non-bg runs at consistent positions, all filled with the same color per block across the height.
 * Odd columns (1,3,5,...) serve as "tracks" for signals: only if they have isolated (max consecutive non-bg ==1) non-bg cells, indicating valid signal columns; no tracks means no changes.
 * Signal rows are unique rows with non-bg in tracks; signal colors are lists of non-8 (or non-bg?) non-bg values from those tracks in a row, excluding 8 specifically in the code (subtle: 8 might be a special "ignore" color even if not bg).
 * Match signals to the best stack's block colors to find a "key" signal row (kk) with the best partial or full sequence match; use this to infer a vertical step (step_v) from block start positions (gap_h = step_v - ww).
 * Extend by placing copies of the key stack's structure at offset positions (pos = best_s + delta * step_v) for other signal rows (i != kk), using their signal colors to fill only bg cells; skip if out of bounds.
 * Extra forward extension: If all signal color lists have the same length, repeatedly append new stacks downward using the last signal's colors, but only if space allows; this seems to cause over-extension in some cases.
 * Subtle: Only fill if target cell is bg; don't overwrite existing non-bg. Blocks must be uniform in color and width across the stack height.
 * Handles multiple blocks per row/stack, with starts derived from key and extended via gaps.
 * Edge cases: No best stack or no tracks/signals = return unchanged grid. If <2 starts, default step_v = ww +1 (assuming single block with gap). Matching allows partial (greedy forward match), but requires exact sequence order.
 * Potential miss: Signals exclude 8 even if not bg; in test, bg=3, so 8 might be treated as signal but code excludes it. Isolated signals mean no vertical runs >1 in tracks.
 * Over-extension risk: The "extra forward" logic duplicates the last pattern indefinitely if lengths uniform, but should stop at grid end or lack of signals.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant bg color.)

```python
def find_runs(row: List[int], bg: int, n: int) -> List[tuple]:
    runs = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        col = row[i]
        while i < n and row[i] == col:
            i += 1
        leng = i - start
        if leng >= 2:
            runs.append((start, leng, col))
    return runs
```
(This extracts horizontal runs of >=2 non-bg cells, useful for detecting block structures; returns (start, length, color).)

(The best stack detection loop is helpful but buggy in extension; signal extraction and matching logic captures core idea of using tracks for guidance.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Incorrect; generated output duplicated the 1-block stacks (positions 8-10 and 13-15) into rows 15-17 (0-based), filling bg=8 cells with 1's where expected output leaves them as 8's (all-empty rows); this over-extended the pattern downward without corresponding signals.
 * Training example 1: Expected output preserves the existing partial stacks (e.g., rows 1-3 with 4's, row 5 with isolated 1's, rows 6-8 with 1's) but adds nothing extra; generated matched existing but added unwarranted lower blocks, likely from faulty "extra forward" logic triggering on uniform signal lengths.
 * Training examples 2 and 3: Correct, indicating the core detection of best stack, tracks, and basic placement works when signals align without needing extra extension.
 * Missed stopping condition for extensions: In training 1, uniform signal lengths (all len=2 for 1-signals?) triggered indefinite forward filling, but expected has gaps/empty rows, suggesting extensions should only align to existing signals, not extrapolate beyond.
 * Signal matching is partial/greedy but worked in 2/3 cases; in training 1, it may have mismatched or over-applied the key (kk) based on the 1-signals.
 * Tracks detection correctly identifies odd columns with only isolated non-bg (maxcon==1), which prevented changes when absent.
 * The "extra forward if all same length" logic is unhelpful/broken: it caused the duplication in training 1 and should be removed or conditioned on actual signals continuing; don't use it in future attempts.
 * Best stack search (tallest hh with uniform ww blocks) is essential and worked, but extension assumes periodic vertical stepping which fails when signals are sparse/gapped.
 * get_background and find_runs are helpful and correct; the stack consistency check (cons) is key for validating uniform blocks.
 * In training 1, lower signals (rows 11-13,17-19 with 1's) were not extended from, but code tried to place from mismatched kk, leading to extras.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it preserves existing structures (e.g., isolated 1/4/2 in early rows, 1/2/4 blocks in rows 5-8 and 10-13) but adds new blocks like 1's in rows 5-8 (cols 13-16,19-22), 4's/2's in rows 10-13 (cols 13-16,18-21), and duplicates 1/4 blocks in rows 15-18 and 20-23, which may over-extend without clear signal justification.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Expected likely only fills gaps in existing stack patterns (e.g., complete the 1/4 blocks in rows 5-8 using signals from odd cols like 1,3,5 with isolated 1/4/2/8, but ignore 8; extend vertically only where signals match sequence, without duplicating entire lower sections like rows 15+ which have no corresponding upper signals).
 * The output fills bg=3 cells in new positions (e.g., row 5 cols 13-16 with 1's, matching a signal pattern?), but extras in rows 20-23 seem like erroneous forward extension similar to training 1 error; this doesn't make sense as those rows lack any signals in tracks (odd cols are all 3's there).
 * Tracks in test: Odd cols (1,3,5,...) have isolated non-3 (e.g., col1: 1's at rows1,5; col3:1/4 at rows1,3,5; col5:1/2/4/1 at various), but maxcon=1 holds; however, output ignores some 8's (row7 col1=8 excluded correctly) but over-places blocks not aligned to all signals.
 * To handle test: Limit placements to only delta positions with actual signals (no blind forward); match full sequences more strictly; the generated has too many filled blocks in lower empty areas, suggesting the extra forward logic fired incorrectly on uniform lengths (e.g., multiple len=4 signal lists).

[2025-10-03 10:48:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of integers (colors/pixels) where the goal is to detect a background color, identify "key" rows and columns with non-background indicators, extract a small key pattern from their intersections, determine a block scale from run lengths, and then "reveal" or fill a larger logo pattern by placing scaled blocks of colors from the key matrix into the grid at aligned positions, overwriting background cells while preserving existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (B) is the most common color in the flattened grid; everything else is a signal or part of the pattern.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (starting from 1, up to min(10, n)) that contain at least one non-B cell in the top min(8, n) rows— this acts as vertical "keys" or anchors for the pattern.
 * Key rows are those (up to top 8) that have at least one non-B in the key columns; the key matrix is extracted solely from intersections of key rows and key columns, forming an m x k color grid (often small, like 3x3).
 * Scale (s) is the maximum horizontal run of consecutive identical non-B cells in any row, used as the width (and sometimes height proxy) for logo blocks.
 * Block starts are horizontal positions where full s-length runs of non-B start across multiple rows; spacing between blocks is derived from differences in these starts (s + empty gaps).
 * Vertical placement: Align blocks to key rows' positions, but shift based on a "filled" index (matching key colors to existing blocks) and spacing; height (h) is derived from the vertical span of the first detected block.
 * Subtlety: Only fill background (B) cells; do not overwrite existing non-B cells. Protection rules skip filling in top/bottom borders if s==2 and B==8 (likely to avoid UI elements or frames).
 * Subtlety: If multiple block starts, use their differences for empty spacing; default to 1 if only one. Block starts may truncate if they exceed grid width.
 * Subtlety: "i_filled" is the highest key row index matching an existing block's color, used to anchor vertical shifts; r_starts are offset from the filled block's row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction is limited to top 8 rows/10 cols, even if grid is larger (e.g., 23x23 in examples); patterns may have side indicators (like vertical stripes in cols 1,3) that are not part of the main logo.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must be solid (all cells in the h x s rectangle match the color) in existing grid to validate; invalid blocks are skipped.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal block detection skips over B runs and only considers non-B runs of at least s.
 * Considerations: Grids can be 23x23 (training) or 27x27 (test); colors vary (1-8, B=8 or 3); patterns may have irregular heights or partial fills; multiple blocks per row/column.
 * All attempts assume logo is placed in a grid-aligned, spaced manner, but fail on vertical alignment or skipping invalid placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies B, used in all attempts and works across examples.)

```python
def get_key_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    key_cols = []
    for c in range(1, min(10, n), 2):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for r in range(min(8, n))):
            key_cols.append(c)
    return key_cols
```
(This identifies odd-indexed key columns with signals in top rows; helpful for anchoring, works in train3.)

```python
def get_key_rows(g: List[List[int]], B: int, key_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rows = set()
    for r in range(min(8, len(g))):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for c in key_cols):
            rows.add(r)
    return sorted(rows)
```
(This finds key rows based on key cols; essential for extracting the key matrix, accurate in examples.)

```python
def get_key_colors(g: List[List[int]], key_rows: List[int], key_cols: List[int], B: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    m = len(key_rows)
    k = len(key_cols)
    kc = [[B] * k for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        r = key_rows[i]
        for j in range(k):
            kc[i][j] = g[r][key_cols[j]]
    return kc
```
(This extracts the m x k key pattern; core to getting colors for filling, works but ignores B in key if present.)

```python
def get_scale(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> int:
    max_s = 1
    for row in g:
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == B:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_color = row[i]
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == start_color:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if length > max_s:
                max_s = length
            i = j
    return max_s
```
(This finds max non-B run length for block width s; helpful, but may overfit if runs vary; works for train3.)

```python
def get_main_start_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = set()
    for r in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i <= n - s:
            if all(g[r][c] == g[r][i] != B for c in range(i, i + s)):
                starts.add(i)
            j = i
            while j < n and g[r][j] == g[r][i]:
                j += 1
            i = j
    return sorted(list(starts))
```
(This detects horizontal start positions for s-length non-B runs; useful for horizontal spacing, but buggy as it adds starts even if not full blocks vertically.)

```python
def get_block_info(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, start_c: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    present_rows = []
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == g[r][start_c] != B for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            present_rows.append(r)
    if not present_rows:
        return None
    min_r = min(present_rows)
    max_r = max(present_rows)
    color = g[min_r][start_c]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        if not all(g[r][c] == color for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            return None
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    return (min_r, h, color)
```
(This validates vertical blocks at a start col, returning position, height, color if solid; helpful for detecting existing filled blocks, key to anchoring.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects B, key rows/cols, and key colors in all cases, as seen in partial matches.
 * Worked well for train3 (fully correct), indicating core logic for spacing, scaling, and filling aligns sometimes when patterns are simple/aligned.
 * Failed train1: Generated extra 4's in row1 cols18-20 (not in expected, which has empty there); placed 1's in rows16-18 cols8-10 but expected has them empty (only side indicators); missed aligning lower 1's blocks to match expected positions in rows11-13 and16-18; overfilled some areas ignoring protection.
 * Failed train2: Missed placing 1's block in rows7-8 cols10-14 (expected has it, but generated only has side 1's and 3's); duplicated 3's in rows10-13 cols16-17 but expected has them only lower; failed to shift vertical placements correctly for middle rows; extra empty rows unfilled.
 * get_main_start_cols is helpful but buggy—adds starts per row without requiring vertical consistency, leading to incorrect spacing (e.g., assumes too many starts in train1/2).
 * get_block_info is essential and mostly correct, but skips invalid blocks; in train1/2, it under-detects filled blocks, causing wrong i_filled (defaults to 0, misaligning r_starts).
 * Protection logic (skip top/bottom if s==2 and B==8) is unhelpful/broken for train1 (B=8, s likely 3, but still overfills borders); not triggered in train2 (B=8? wait, train2 seems B=8, but no protection applied correctly).
 * Vertical shifting via i_filled and r_starts works in train3 but fails in train1/2 due to poor matching of key colors to blocks (uses max possible_i, but misses color consistency across h).
 * Horizontal block_starts truncate correctly but spacing (s + empty) assumes uniform gaps; in train1, diff-based empty=1? leads to overlaps/misplacements.
 * Overall, attempt understands extraction and scaling but mishandles vertical alignment and validation, causing partial/overfills in complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies B=3, extracts keys (e.g., fills 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16,20-23 matching input hints), places scaled blocks (s likely 4, seen in 4x4 fills of 1,4,2), and uses spacing ~4+3=7 (e.g., blocks at cols13-16,20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overwrites/adds 8's in rows20-23 cols13-16 (input has empty 3's, but 8 may be invalid color for this grid—B=3, 8 seems out of place); misses filling some hinted areas like row3 col5=2 (remains isolated, not expanded to block); row5 col3=4 not expanded vertically/horizontally to match key; extra 1's in row5 col13-16 but input already has them, and it doesn't align all key rows (e.g., lower keys in rows15-18,20-23 partially filled but shifted wrong, adding 1's in row19? wait, row15-18 has 1's and 4's but expected likely needs consistent h=4 blocks); side indicators (cols1,3,5) preserved but logo blocks seem misaligned vertically (e.g., row20-23 8's block doesn't match any key color pattern).
 * Fills bottom rows20-23 with 8's block, but input has no such hint there—likely wrong color from key mismatch or invalid extraction; upper rows0-3 side fills (1,4,2) not blocked properly.
 * To handle test: Need better block validation (require full h consistency before filling), correct i_filled to min/max instead of max, and ignore/exclude B=3 in key_colors properly; spacing may need vertical detection too.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 2D grid (likely representing a pixel art or pattern completion task) needs to be completed by filling background cells (most common color, e.g., 8 or 3) with colored rectangular blocks. The blocks are inferred from vertical "tracks" (odd-indexed columns with isolated non-background signals), horizontal runs of colors in signal rows, and propagating uniform block templates (of consistent height h and width w) forward/backward across the grid using specific step sizes and gaps, with a fallback mode for simple linear filling if no template is detected.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent color; non-bg cells in odd columns (tracks) must have isolated signals (max consecutive non-bg of 1 per column) to qualify as valid tracks—columns with longer runs or no signals are ignored.
 * Signal rows (srows) are rows with non-bg colors in tracks, but filter out color 8 (possibly a special/noise value); collect per-row color sequences from tracks as "sig_colors" lists, which form subsequences for matching block color patterns.
 * Block detection searches for horizontal templates: uniform rectangular blocks (height ph from 2 to n, width w from runs >=2 in a starting row sr) with consistent colors across height; the block's color sequence must be a subsequence of some sig_colors entry.
 * Propagation uses asymmetric steps: forward step_f = 2*h -1, backward step_b = 2*h +1; horizontal spacing via horiz_diff = 2*w -1, gap = horiz_diff - w; adjust template starts by extending/contracting based on color list lengths, and skip if out of bounds.
 * Subtlety: When propagating, d_step varies—if current num_b > next/prev len, use h, else use step_f/step_b; only fill bg cells (don't overwrite existing).
 * Extra forward pass if trailing sig_colors have uniform lengths: repeat last colors with step_f.
 * Fallback if no template found: fixed h=2, w=2, horiz_diff=5, step_f=5, starts at n//2, s=min(8,n)+h, linear forward filling with extensions; extra forward if all sig_colors same length.
 * Easy to miss: is_subsequence allows non-consecutive matching (e.g., [1,4] matches if 1 then later 4 in sig_colors); runs only consider >=2 length; uniform check requires exact color match across entire block height/width.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 23x23); outputs copy of input with fills.
 * Considerations: Overfilling (e.g., placing blocks where expected is bg) due to fallback triggering incorrectly; missing propagation direction or step miscalculation leads to gaps; subsequence matching may align wrong if multiple similar sig_colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies bg, tracks, and sig_colors in all cases, and the template search with run-based uniform blocks works for train3 (exact match via propagation).
 * Worked: is_subsequence and find_runs enable accurate color matching and run detection; fallback partially handles linear patterns but overfills in train1/2.
 * Didn't work: Template search failed to find/align blocks in train1/2, triggering fallback which placed extra 1's in rows 16-18 of train1 (where expected all 8's) and extra 3's in rows 10/14 of train2 (expected 3's only in rows 10-11 and 13-14, but positions mismatched—generated row10 has 1's+3's but expected all 8's for row10? Wait, row indexing: generated overpropagated downward).
 * In train1, generated matches expected in upper/mid but adds unauthorized 1-blocks in lower empty areas (rows 16-18 cols 8-10/13-15), likely fallback misplacement.
 * In train2, generated adds extra 3's in row10 cols16-17 (expected all 8's there) and duplicates in row14 (expected has 3's but shifted?); misses vertical alignment for 3's in rows13-14.
 * Fallback is helpful for simple cases (train3) but broken for complex—overextends with fixed h=2/w=2/step=5, ignoring actual patterns, leading to irrelevant fills.
 * get_tracks is essential and correct (filters isolated signals well); get_valid_srows_and_colors useful but filters color=8 too aggressively (may miss if 8 is valid signal).
 * Propagation logic subtle but flawed: backward loop uses kk-1 to 0 but starts from found s, may skip/underfill; forward extra only if uniform lengths, but in train1/2 lengths vary (e.g., train1 sig_colors likely [4],[4],[4,4,4],[1,1,1] varying).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but fallback block is not helpful (causes overfill; avoid or condition better).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves most bg=3 intact, fills isolated vertical signals (cols1,3,5 with 1/4/2) without extension, and attempts block fills like 1's in rows1-4 cols13-16/18-21 (matching a 4x4 pattern), 4's+2's in rows10-13 cols13-16/18-21, and 1's+4's in rows17-20 cols13-16/18-21, suggesting propagation from detected templates.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: upper fills (rows1-4) overwrite existing non-bg (e.g., row3 col5=2 remains but nearby 1's added; expected likely preserves isolated signals without merging). Lower fills (rows17-20) add 1's+4's where input has none, but input row17 all 3's—propagation may overextend if steps miscalculated (e.g., from row11-14 4/2 blocks, step_f=3? leads to row18ish). Misses potential backward fill from row5-6 1/4 signals. Extra 8 in row7 col1 seems erroneous (input 8? but bg=3, possibly noise). Overall, blocks align to tracks but heights/positions don't match input patterns (e.g., row11-14 should propagate 4/2 without changing to 1/4 below); likely fallback or wrong h=4 triggered incorrectly.
 * To handle test: Ensure template search starts from actual signal rows (e.g., row0-6,10-14,17-20); adjust steps for bg=3 grids (n=27? wider); verify subsequence matches don't skip varying lengths like [1,1,1,1] to [4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with a dominant background color like 8 or 3), where the task is to detect and extend vertical stacks of uniform horizontal blocks based on "signals" in odd-numbered columns that act as sparse guides or tracks, while avoiding over-extension or duplication of patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common cell value; all operations ignore or skip it unless placing new blocks.
 * Identify "runs" as horizontal sequences of 2+ identical non-background cells in a row.
 * Detect the "best stack": the tallest (hh) vertical group of rows starting at ss, where each row has the same-width (ww >=2) non-bg runs at consistent positions, all filled with the same color per block across the height.
 * Odd columns (1,3,5,...) serve as "tracks" for signals: only if they have isolated (max consecutive non-bg ==1) non-bg cells, indicating valid signal columns; no tracks means no changes.
 * Signal rows are unique rows with non-bg in tracks; signal colors are lists of non-8 (or non-bg?) non-bg values from those tracks in a row, excluding 8 specifically in the code (subtle: 8 might be a special "ignore" color even if not bg).
 * Match signals to the best stack's block colors to find a "key" signal row (kk) with the best partial or full sequence match; use this to infer a vertical step (step_v) from block start positions (gap_h = step_v - ww).
 * Extend by placing copies of the key stack's structure at offset positions (pos = best_s + delta * step_v) for other signal rows (i != kk), using their signal colors to fill only bg cells; skip if out of bounds.
 * Extra forward extension: If all signal color lists have the same length, repeatedly append new stacks downward using the last signal's colors, but only if space allows; this seems to cause over-extension in some cases.
 * Subtle: Only fill if target cell is bg; don't overwrite existing non-bg. Blocks must be uniform in color and width across the stack height.
 * Handles multiple blocks per row/stack, with starts derived from key and extended via gaps.
 * Edge cases: No best stack or no tracks/signals = return unchanged grid. If <2 starts, default step_v = ww +1 (assuming single block with gap). Matching allows partial (greedy forward match), but requires exact sequence order.
 * Potential miss: Signals exclude 8 even if not bg; in test, bg=3, so 8 might be treated as signal but code excludes it. Isolated signals mean no vertical runs >1 in tracks.
 * Over-extension risk: The "extra forward" logic duplicates the last pattern indefinitely if lengths uniform, but should stop at grid end or lack of signals.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant bg color.)

```python
def find_runs(row: List[int], bg: int, n: int) -> List[tuple]:
    runs = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        col = row[i]
        while i < n and row[i] == col:
            i += 1
        leng = i - start
        if leng >= 2:
            runs.append((start, leng, col))
    return runs
```
(This extracts horizontal runs of >=2 non-bg cells, useful for detecting block structures; returns (start, length, color).)

(The best stack detection loop is helpful but buggy in extension; signal extraction and matching logic captures core idea of using tracks for guidance.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Incorrect; generated output duplicated the 1-block stacks (positions 8-10 and 13-15) into rows 15-17 (0-based), filling bg=8 cells with 1's where expected output leaves them as 8's (all-empty rows); this over-extended the pattern downward without corresponding signals.
 * Training example 1: Expected output preserves the existing partial stacks (e.g., rows 1-3 with 4's, row 5 with isolated 1's, rows 6-8 with 1's) but adds nothing extra; generated matched existing but added unwarranted lower blocks, likely from faulty "extra forward" logic triggering on uniform signal lengths.
 * Training examples 2 and 3: Correct, indicating the core detection of best stack, tracks, and basic placement works when signals align without needing extra extension.
 * Missed stopping condition for extensions: In training 1, uniform signal lengths (all len=2 for 1-signals?) triggered indefinite forward filling, but expected has gaps/empty rows, suggesting extensions should only align to existing signals, not extrapolate beyond.
 * Signal matching is partial/greedy but worked in 2/3 cases; in training 1, it may have mismatched or over-applied the key (kk) based on the 1-signals.
 * Tracks detection correctly identifies odd columns with only isolated non-bg (maxcon==1), which prevented changes when absent.
 * The "extra forward if all same length" logic is unhelpful/broken: it caused the duplication in training 1 and should be removed or conditioned on actual signals continuing; don't use it in future attempts.
 * Best stack search (tallest hh with uniform ww blocks) is essential and worked, but extension assumes periodic vertical stepping which fails when signals are sparse/gapped.
 * get_background and find_runs are helpful and correct; the stack consistency check (cons) is key for validating uniform blocks.
 * In training 1, lower signals (rows 11-13,17-19 with 1's) were not extended from, but code tried to place from mismatched kk, leading to extras.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it preserves existing structures (e.g., isolated 1/4/2 in early rows, 1/2/4 blocks in rows 5-8 and 10-13) but adds new blocks like 1's in rows 5-8 (cols 13-16,19-22), 4's/2's in rows 10-13 (cols 13-16,18-21), and duplicates 1/4 blocks in rows 15-18 and 20-23, which may over-extend without clear signal justification.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Expected likely only fills gaps in existing stack patterns (e.g., complete the 1/4 blocks in rows 5-8 using signals from odd cols like 1,3,5 with isolated 1/4/2/8, but ignore 8; extend vertically only where signals match sequence, without duplicating entire lower sections like rows 15+ which have no corresponding upper signals).
 * The output fills bg=3 cells in new positions (e.g., row 5 cols 13-16 with 1's, matching a signal pattern?), but extras in rows 20-23 seem like erroneous forward extension similar to training 1 error; this doesn't make sense as those rows lack any signals in tracks (odd cols are all 3's there).
 * Tracks in test: Odd cols (1,3,5,...) have isolated non-3 (e.g., col1: 1's at rows1,5; col3:1/4 at rows1,3,5; col5:1/2/4/1 at various), but maxcon=1 holds; however, output ignores some 8's (row7 col1=8 excluded correctly) but over-places blocks not aligned to all signals.
 * To handle test: Limit placements to only delta positions with actual signals (no blind forward); match full sequences more strictly; the generated has too many filled blocks in lower empty areas, suggesting the extra forward logic fired incorrectly on uniform lengths (e.g., multiple len=4 signal lists).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    count = Counter(flat)

```
(Helpful: Accurately identifies bg via frequency.)

```python
def find_min_fg(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> int:
    candidates = [c for row in g for c in row if c != bg]
    return min(candidates) if candidates else bg
```
(Helpful: Gets lowest foreground color for default additions.)

def find_large_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int) -> tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]]:
    # (Full flood-fill based detection of filled rectangular components >1 cell)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'y1', 'y2', 'x1', 'x2', 'color', 'h', 'w'
```
(Helpful and essential: Correctly extracts only solid large rectangles via DFS stack, bounding box, and filled verification; ignores small/irregular blobs.)

```python
def has_special(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], bg: int, blocks: tp.List[tp.Dict[str, int]], y1: int, h: int, large_color: int, min_fg: int) -> tp.Tuple[bool, int]:

    if not blocks:
        return False, 0
    min_x1 = min(b['x1'] for b in blocks)
    for yy in range(y1, y1 + h):
        for xx in range(min_x1):
            c = g[yy][xx]
            if c != bg and c != large_color and c != min_fg:
                return True, c
    return False, 0
```
(Helpful: Detects special marker colors left of blocks in original rows, triggering alternate positioning/coloring.)

```python
def calculate_normal_positions(y1: int, h: int, n: int) -> tp.List[int]:
    step = 5
    added = []
    p1 = y1 + step
    if p1 + h - 1 < n:
        added.append(p1)
        p2 = y1 + 2 * step
        if p2 + h - 1 < n:
            added.append(p2)
    if len(added) < 2:
        added = []
        p1 = y1 - step
        if p1 >= 0:
            added.append(p1)
            p2 = y1 - 2 * step
            if p2 >= 0:
                added.append(p2)
    return added
```
(Helpful: Computes 1-2 addition positions with fixed step=5, preferring down then up; but may need adjustment for special cases or when <2 fit.)

```python
def add_rectangle(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], py: int, x1: int, x2: int, color: int, h: int, n: int):
    for i in range(h):
        yy = py + i
        if 0 <= yy < n:
            for xx in range(x1, x2 + 1):
                out[yy][xx] = color
```
(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving detection and replication of horizontal block patterns (anchors) across multiple rows, guided by "key" sequences extracted from specific rows and columns, to fill in missing or implied parts of the grid while preserving the background and avoiding overwriting existing non-background elements. The goal is to identify repeating block structures and propagate them vertically using patterned stepping, matching color sequences from keys to ensure correct placement.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common color; all placements must respect it by only overwriting bg cells, never existing non-bg cells.
 * Horizontal runs are sequences of identical non-bg cells of length >=2; anchors require identical run starts, lengths (>=2), and colors repeating for at least h=2 consecutive rows.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (1,3,5,7,9) with any non-bg in the first 8 rows; key rows are those with non-bg in key columns (first 8 rows); key colors are non-bg, non-8 values from key row-key col intersections, forming per-row color lists that act as sequence guides.
 * Anchor selection prioritizes tallest h, then earliest start row s, and requires block colors to be a subsequence of some key color list; spacing (diff) between blocks is derived from starts or defaults to w+2 if single block.
 * Placement for other keys uses delta-based stepping: step_down=2*h-1 for below, step_up=2*h+1 for above; extend block starts rightward using anchor_diff if key sequence is longer than anchor blocks.
 * Subtle: Exclude color 8 from keys (possibly a special marker or invalid for replication); single-block anchors use w+2 as diff; only place if target row range fits grid; subsequence matching allows partial embeds (e.g., anchor colors subset of key).
 * Grids may have size >8 (up to 27x27 in test), but keys limited to first 8 rows/cols; patterns may not span full width; replication only for matching subsequences, skipping if out-of-bounds or no match.
 * Potential misses: Wrong anchor selection (e.g., picking a shorter/wrong-color repeat); incorrect stepping leading to overlap or misplacement; failing to extend blocks for longer keys; not handling isolated non-repeating patterns.
 * All attempts assume rectangular grid input/output; preserve existing non-bg (only fill bg).

```
(Note: get_key_cols, get_key_rows, get_key_colors, find_anchor are helpful but buggy in current form—e.g., find_anchor has return tuple mismatch and incomplete extension logic; use as base but fix.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The current find_anchor: Broken return (appends extra h, slices to 6 but expects 7); assumes uniform w across blocks (fails if varied); diff calculation assumes >=2 blocks or defaults poorly; doesn't handle multiple possible anchors well (picks by h then s, but may miss best subsequence match).
 * get_key_colors: Excludes 8 arbitrarily (works for train1 bg=8 but may be puzzle rule); filters only key_cols but ignores full row context.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) passed training examples 2 and 3 fully (correct outputs match expected, demonstrating core anchor detection, key extraction, and stepping work for those cases).
 * Failed training example 1: Generated output incorrectly placed 4-colored blocks in rows 6-8 (positions ~8-10 and ~13-15) where expected has 1's; also placed extra 4's in rows 11-13 third block where expected has 4's but mismatched prior (actually, rows 11-13 third block is correct as 4's, but rows 6-8 wrong color suggests anchor mismatch—likely picked a 4-based anchor instead of 1-based, or wrong ki assignment; rows 16-18 correctly placed 1's, but overall incomplete as lower empty rows stayed empty correctly).
 * What worked: Background detection (8 in train1, 3 in test); run extraction for anchors; subsequence matching to keys; basic placement without overwriting; stepping logic positioned blocks vertically correctly in passing cases (e.g., delta-based row calc).
 * What didn't: Anchor selection suboptimal (chose wrong h/s/ki in train1, leading to color swap 4->1 error); block extension in placement loop caps at min(len(temp_starts), m) but may not pad correctly for short anchors/long keys; key_colors exclude 8 (helped train1 but unclear if general); no handling for non-uniform block widths or single-block diffs; program returns copy if no anchor/keys, which is safe but misses non-anchor patterns.
 * extract_objects not present but implied via runs/keys—essential for identifying replicable blocks vs. static elements.
 * Subtle miss: In train1, expected has isolated 1's in rows 1,3,5 (cols 1,3) not replicated, showing only multi-row repeating runs are anchors; generated preserved them but erred on replication color.
 * Overall understanding: Core replication via keys/anchors grasped (passes 2/3 trains), but edge cases like multiple possible anchors or color-specific matching fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects bg=3; preserves existing patterns (e.g., row 0 all 3's, row 7 has isolated 8 at col1 untouched); replicates horizontal blocks like 1's/4's/2's in rows 1-4 and 10-13,17-20 using apparent stepping (e.g., 4-high blocks at cols ~13-16 and ~18-21, matching key-like sequences); extends to 4 blocks in some rows (e.g., row 17 adds 1's at end).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 5 has partial fills (1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) that seem like over-placement or wrong extension (expected likely preserves isolated or non-repeating as-is, without filling bg between); rows 6-9 and 14-16 are mostly empty but generated fills row 5 oddly; third block in rows 17-20 is 4's where input has none, but adds extra 1's at cols 23-26 which may overrun or mismatch subsequence (input row 17 has 1's only in first two blocks); isolated 8 in row7 col1 is preserved but not replicated (correct, as non-run); overall, stepping seems asymmetric (down more filled than up), and no replication in upper/lower empties suggests missed anchors—likely wrong anchor picked (e.g., 4-high 1/4/2 seq from rows1-4 as anchor, but misextended for lower keys including the 8? which is excluded); differs from expected by adding unrequested blocks (e.g., extra 1's) and partial row5, indicating subsequence or diff calc error for longer keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid represents a pattern with a background color, vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns) containing isolated signal colors, and horizontal "blocks" (consecutive cells of the same non-background color, at least 2 wide) that need to be detected, anchored, and extended or placed vertically to match subsequences of signal colors across multiple rows. The goal is to generate an output grid that completes or replicates these block patterns at relative positions based on an anchor point, filling only background areas without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the most common or uniform row color (e.g., 3), but must be reliably detected even if not all rows are uniform.
 * Tracks are specifically odd-indexed columns (j in range(1, size, 2)) that contain at least one non-background cell, but only qualify if all non-background cells are isolated (max consecutive == 1), indicating "signals" rather than blocks.
 * Signal rows are those with any non-background in tracks; signal colors are the list of non-background values in those tracks per row, in track order.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of the same non-background color (>=2 wide) across any row; all detected blocks must have uniform width (h) for anchoring to work, otherwise fall back to default placement.
 * Anchoring requires finding a starting row s where a vertical stack of h rows has uniform horizontal blocks matching the positions/sizes in block_ranges, and their colors form a subsequence of one signal_colors list (using is_subsequence check); this anchor_k identifies which signal to "root" placements to.
 * Placements extend blocks forward/backward from anchor using steps (e.g., 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and differences from existing ranges; only fill background cells, and limit to grid bounds.
 * If no blocks or no anchor found, default to h=2, centered horizontal placements with fixed spacing (diff_start=2*h+1, vertical step=2*h+1), starting from grid center.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., block colors can be a subset of signal colors in order); placements can overlap or extend partial blocks but shouldn't overwrite non-bg; vertical positioning uses delta * step, with forward/backward steps differing to avoid overlap; isolated signals (max_consec=1) distinguish tracks from potential vertical blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty signals return input unchanged; non-uniform block widths or invalid anchors trigger default mode; bounds checking prevents out-of-grid placements; multiple signals per row possible, but colors list per signal_row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure block detection scans all rows but deduplicates ranges by position; vertical uniformity check in anchor must verify entire block rectangle is same color; default mode assumes symmetric centering but may not fit odd-sized grids perfectly.

```python
def find_anchor(g: List[List[int]], block_ranges: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, signal_colors: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # (Full function body as in program; checks vertical uniformity and subsequence match)
```
(Core for locating anchor; verifies full rectangular uniformity, which is subtle and easy to miss.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * extend_ranges and place_blocks: These are implementation helpers but can over-extend beyond grid or place on non-bg if not careful (e.g., no overwrite check in place_blocks beyond bg==3); they're functional but brittle for varying sizes.
 * The default placement logic in program (when no blocks/anchor): Assumes fixed h=2 and centering, which works for training but may not generalize to test if input expects different h or asymmetry; it's a fallback but overrides custom block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchoring/placement logic.
 * Worked well: Uniform background detection, isolated signal filtering in tracks, subsequence matching for anchors, and relative placement with steps (forward/backward differentiation avoids overlap in training).
 * Did not work/partial issues: In default mode (no blocks), fixed spacing (e.g., diff_start=2*h+1) may not align with input patterns if test has asymmetric or wider defaults; anchor search assumes blocks exist in exact range positions vertically, which could miss partial or shifted anchors.
 * Block width uniformity check is strict (len(widths)!=1 returns copy), which is good for consistency but may fail tests with mixed widths (fallback to default helps but isn't adaptive).
 * No explicit handling for multiple block sets per row or vertical signals misidentified as tracks (but max_consec=1 prevents most).
 * Training successes suggest extract-like functions (get_tracks, get_signal_colors, get_block_ranges) are essential for decomposing the grid into signals vs. blocks.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt demonstrates progressive logic (detect -> extract -> anchor -> place), which is helpful for future refinements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (27x27 grid, bg=3) shows partial placements: e.g., row 1 has isolated 1's in positions ~1,3,5 (possibly misplaced signals) and a block of four 1's starting ~13, then another at ~18-21 and ~23-26; row 3 has similar but with 4's and a 2; rows 10-13 have vertical stacks of four 4's (~13-16) and four 2's (~18-21,23-26); rows 17-20 mirror with 1's and four 4's.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely complete symmetric horizontal blocks across full h-height vertical stacks matching all signal_colors subsequences, but here placements are inconsistent—e.g., row 1 has singles (not blocks >=2), row 2/4/5 are mostly bg with trailing 1's (partial fills?), and upper rows (0,6-9) are all bg (possibly no signals there). Lower blocks (rows 10-13,17-20) look like proper 4-high stacks, but spacing/diffs seem off (e.g., 4's and 2's blocks are adjacent without expected gaps like 2*h+1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input had partial anchors or signals in odd columns, output should extend uniformly without isolated cells (e.g., row1 singles suggest failed block placement or track misdetection); vertical stacks are present but may not match all signal rows (e.g., no clear anchor in upper half); many rows remain all-bg, indicating skipped placements due to bounds or delta*step overflow (size=27, steps~5 for h=2 could skip). Unknown why upper signals (1,4,2) didn't form full blocks—possibly anchor not found, triggering partial default.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense (some block completions) but appears incomplete/inaccurate, missing full pattern replication (e.g., no forward/backward extensions from a clear anchor; irregularities like non-uniform heights).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or signals on a background, where the task is to detect sparse "signals" in vertical tracks and use them to identify and extend uniform colored block patterns across the grid, anchoring from an existing block structure and propagating it to match signal sequences in other rows. The goal is to fill in missing blocks while preserving existing content and ensuring blocks are uniform rectangles that align with signal colors as subsequences.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color, often 3 in examples; all uniform rows help confirm it, but fall back to top-left if no full uniform row.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals—defined as having at least one non-bg cell, but crucially only those where non-bg cells are isolated (max consecutive non-bg == 1, no clumps).
 * Signals are rows with non-bg cells in tracks; collect unique such rows, sort them, and extract non-bg colors from tracks in those rows (excluding 8, which may be a special/noise value).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ consecutive identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start, end) ranges across the grid.
 * Anchor detection: Search for a rectangular block structure (height h >=2, starting at row s) where blocks are uniform color across height, all blocks same width w, positions match a sorted list of block ranges, and the sequence of block colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors.
 * Extension: Once anchored, propagate to other signal rows by calculating row positions with forward/backward steps (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward), extending block ranges rightward if needed (with fixed gap between blocks), and placing only on bg cells.
 * Fallback if no anchor: Use default h=2, w=2, start blocks at center, step backward from bottom, extend ranges, place blocks— but this seems less precise and may overlap or misalign.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., blocks match a subset); only place on bg to avoid overwriting; ensure extended ranges don't exceed grid size; gap between blocks is derived from anchor (end1 +1 + gap = start2); signals may have varying numbers of colors, so extend blocks to match; isolated signals (max_consec=1) define tracks, but blocks can be wider; 8 is ignored in signal colors, possibly a delimiter or invalid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no signals returns copy; anchor search starts from larger h downward, left-to-right s; if multiple anchors possible, takes first found; propagation skips invalid positions (out of bounds); in fallback, starts from bottom and steps up (negative direction).
 * All existing non-bg must be preserved unless overwritten logically, but code only overwrites bg; block colors must exactly match signal colors in order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Checks if sequence a appears in order (not necessarily contiguous) in b; crucial for matching block colors to signals.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchor-based propagation.
 * Anchor finding with subsequence matching worked well for trainings, allowing flexible pattern extension without requiring exact sequence matches.
 * Fallback logic (default blocks from bottom) was not triggered in trainings (since anchors found), but ensures something is placed if no anchor.
 * get_tracks enforces isolated signals (max_consec=1), which is crucial and worked; without it, clumped columns might be misidentified.
 * place_blocks only overwrites bg, preserving existing non-bg, which is correct and prevented overwriting in trainings.
 * extend_block_ranges correctly adds blocks rightward with fixed gap and width, handling varying signal lengths.
 * No major misses in trainings, but search for anchor starts from larger h downward and left s, which may prefer certain patterns; step calculations (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) seem empirically tuned for spacing between signal rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows placements in rows 10-13 (4-wide blocks of 4 at cols 13-16, 2 at 18-21), rows 17-20 (4-wide 1 at 13-16, 4 at 18-21, 1 at 23-26), and scattered signals in upper rows (e.g., row1: 1s at cols1,3,13-16,18-21,23-26; row3 similar), with some existing patterns like row3 cols13-16=1s preserved/modified minimally.
 * It looks partially correct: blocks are uniform rectangles matching apparent signal colors (e.g., 4s and 2s in lower, 1s and 4s in mid-lower), placed on bg=3 without overwriting, and aligned to even-ish columns suggesting track influence; spacing/gaps seem consistent (e.g., gap=1 between block groups).
 * However, upper signals (rows 1-5) have placements like isolated 1/4/2 in even cols (0,2,5?), but code targets odd tracks— this may be existing input not extended, or fallback/misplacement; row6 has 1/4/1 but no block extension visible, suggesting propagation skipped invalid positions.
 * Lower blocks (rows10-13,17-20) match multi-color signals (e.g., [4,2] subsequence for row10+), but row14-16 are all bg—no placement, possibly no matching signal or out-of-bounds; overall, it makes sense as an extension but may miss forward propagation from anchor (if anchor in upper/mid) or undetect some tracks (e.g., col5 has signals but no blocks there).
 * Existing input has vertical alignments (e.g., cols13-16 have 1s in rows2-5, then 4s lower), and output extends horizontally into blocks, which aligns with rules; no obvious errors like overwriting non-bg or mismatched colors, but subtle issue: signal rows include row7? (all bg, skipped correctly), and 8 in row7 col1 ignored properly.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:54:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a dominant background color like 8 or 3), where vertical "tracks" carry signal patterns of colors, and horizontal blocks of uniform colors (at least 2 cells wide) form repeating or extrapolated patterns that must be anchored to a signal sequence and replicated vertically at positions derived from other signal rows, effectively completing or extending a patterned structure like a barcode or waveform visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common cell value; all non-background placements must overwrite only background cells without disrupting existing non-background content.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals: isolated single non-background cells (consecutive non-bg must be exactly 1 per track for validity), excluding color 8 which may be special or ignored in signals.
 * Signals are extracted per row across valid tracks, collecting non-bg, non-8 colors; these form sequences per row, sorted by row index.
 * Horizontal blocks are runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in rows; these are candidates for uniform vertical rectangles (same color across height h rows).
 * Anchoring requires finding a vertical uniform block of height h (tried from size//2 down to 2) starting at row s, where the sequence of block colors (one per block range) is a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors the pattern for replication.
 * Replication: For other signal rows i relative to anchor kk, calculate target start row target_s using steps like 2h-1 (downward) or 2h+1 (upward? code has asymmetry), ensuring target_s + h fits in grid; place colors as vertical blocks using extrapolated ranges (extending existing block starts by fixed width w and gaps like base_diff).
 * All blocks in a pattern must share the same width w (if not uniform, abort); new ranges are appended by adding w + gap from last, but capped at num colors and grid size.
 * Subsequence matching is loose (block colors must appear in order within signal colors, allowing extras); only place if color != bg and !=8.
 * Subtle: Anchor search starts from larger h downward, scans starting rows s; validity checks uniform color across the entire block rectangle and no out-of-bounds.
 * Easy to miss: Signals ignore 8 (possibly a separator or invalid); tracks require max_consec==1 (no stacked signals in column); placement skips if target out of bounds; code assumes sorted signal_data but places based on index delta.
 * In replication, delta >0 uses step=2h-1 (tight packing downward), delta<0 uses 2h+1 (looser upward?); base_diff from existing starts if multiple, else w+2.
 * Overwriting only bg cells during place; if existing non-bg, it stays (no overwrite).
 * Edge cases: No blocks or non-uniform w aborts to original grid; empty signals or no anchor returns original; size may vary (23x27 in ex2, 27x27 in test?).

(Helpful for finding anchor: vertical uniform blocks matching subsequence of a signal row.)

The following functions are mostly helpful but have bugs (see previous attempts):
```python
def get_temp_ranges(block_ranges: List[Tuple[int, int]], num: int, w: int, base_diff: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    temp = list(block_ranges)

        return temp[:num]
    for _ in range(num - current_len):
        last_start = temp[-1][0]
        if current_len == 1:
            new_start = last_start + base_diff
        else:
            new_start = last_start + w  # Bug: should be w + gap?
        if new_start + w - 1 >= size:
            break
        temp.append((new_start, new_start + w - 1))
        current_len += 1
    return temp[:num]

def place(out: List[List[int]], target_s: int, h: int, colors: List[int], temp_ranges: List[Tuple[int, int]], bg: int, size: int):
    num = min(len(colors), len(temp_ranges))
    for j in range(num):
        c = colors[j]
        if c == bg or c == 8:
            continue
        start_c, end_c = temp_ranges[j]
        for r in range(max(0, target_s), min(size, target_s + h)):
            for cc in range(max(0, start_c), min(size, end_c + 1)):
                if out[r][cc] == bg:  # Only overwrite bg
                    out[r][cc] = c
```
(These handle range extrapolation and placement but have positioning bugs.)

 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated output places the 3,3 blocks (in rows 10-11,13-14) starting one column too left (e.g., columns 15-16 instead of 16-17), causing overlap or misalignment with the expected 8 separator; this repeats in all affected rows, while 1,1 blocks are correctly placed at columns 10-11,13-14.
 * Training example 3: Correct, handled whatever pattern (likely similar to 1) without the shift bug manifesting.
 * Overall, worked for detecting bg (8), tracks (odd cols with singles), signals (ignoring 8), block ranges, uniform anchor via subsequence, and step-based positioning (2h-1/2h+1); failed in range extrapolation/ placement for cases with multiple blocks per pattern, likely due to incorrect gap calculation in get_temp_ranges (uses w instead of w + gap for extensions, and base_diff only for second block).
 * is_subsequence is essential and correct for loose matching.
 * find_anchor is mostly correct but may pick suboptimal h/s if multiple candidates (tries largest h first, which is good).
 * get_temp_ranges is broken: for extensions beyond existing blocks, it adds only w (adjacent, no gap), but examples suggest gaps (e.g., +3 or +2 between starts); base_diff is used only for second, then switches to w, causing merged/ shifted blocks.
 * place is helpful but only overwrites bg, which is correct, but combined with bad ranges leads to wrong positions.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, though get_temp_ranges needs fix for gaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it appears to place patterns (e.g., long 1's in rows 1-5 columns ~13-26 matching some signal, 4's and 2's in rows 10-13 columns 13-17 and 18-21), but introduces anomalies like a single 8 in row 7 column 1 (which was likely in input but not overwritten or handled as signal, suggesting improper track/signal extraction or placement skipping).
 * In rows 17-20, it places 1's (columns 13-16), 4's (18-21), and extra 1's (23-26), but the right-side 1's (23-26) seem extrapolated incorrectly or with wrong gaps, as input has 1's only on left in similar rows; this may over-extend ranges without proper base_diff.
 * Top rows 0-6 have partial signals placed (1's and 4/2 in cols 1,3,5 matching input?), but row 3 has 4 in col 1 and 2 in col 5, while row 5 overwrites some; bottom is empty-ish except placed blocks, suggesting anchor found in upper part but replication downward missed some signals or miscalculated steps (e.g., no placement in rows 14-16 or 21+).
 * Compared to inferred expected (based on code logic and training): Likely should replicate upper signal patterns (1's,4,2 mixes) downward to match lower signals, with uniform blocks of w=4 for 1/4/2 groups separated by single 3's (gaps of 1 bg col); generated has correct widths but wrong starting columns/gaps (e.g., 1's in 23-26 shouldn't be there if input signals don't indicate extension that far), and the isolated 8 in row 7 indicates failure to treat 8 as non-signal or bg variant.
 * Does not make complete sense: Placements seem partially guided by signals but shifted/ overextended, similar to training 2 bug; misses potential upward replication or different step for this bg=3 case; extra 1's on right suggest broken get_temp_ranges appending without size check or wrong base_diff (input has 1's starting at col13, but extends to 26 without gap).

[2025-10-03 10:54:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of integers (colors/pixels) where the goal is to detect a background color, identify "key" rows and columns with non-background indicators, extract a small key pattern from their intersections, determine a block scale from run lengths, and then "reveal" or fill a larger logo pattern by placing scaled blocks of colors from the key matrix into the grid at aligned positions, overwriting background cells while preserving existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (B) is the most common color in the flattened grid; everything else is a signal or part of the pattern.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (starting from 1, up to min(10, n)) that contain at least one non-B cell in the top min(8, n) rows— this acts as vertical "keys" or anchors for the pattern.
 * Key rows are those (up to top 8) that have at least one non-B in the key columns; the key matrix is extracted solely from intersections of key rows and key columns, forming an m x k color grid (often small, like 3x3).
 * Scale (s) is the maximum horizontal run of consecutive identical non-B cells in any row, used as the width (and sometimes height proxy) for logo blocks.
 * Block starts are horizontal positions where full s-length runs of non-B start across multiple rows; spacing between blocks is derived from differences in these starts (s + empty gaps).
 * Vertical placement: Align blocks to key rows' positions, but shift based on a "filled" index (matching key colors to existing blocks) and spacing; height (h) is derived from the vertical span of the first detected block.
 * Subtlety: Only fill background (B) cells; do not overwrite existing non-B cells. Protection rules skip filling in top/bottom borders if s==2 and B==8 (likely to avoid UI elements or frames).
 * Subtlety: If multiple block starts, use their differences for empty spacing; default to 1 if only one. Block starts may truncate if they exceed grid width.
 * Subtlety: "i_filled" is the highest key row index matching an existing block's color, used to anchor vertical shifts; r_starts are offset from the filled block's row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction is limited to top 8 rows/10 cols, even if grid is larger (e.g., 23x23 in examples); patterns may have side indicators (like vertical stripes in cols 1,3) that are not part of the main logo.
 * Easy to miss: Blocks must be solid (all cells in the h x s rectangle match the color) in existing grid to validate; invalid blocks are skipped.
 * Easy to miss: Horizontal block detection skips over B runs and only considers non-B runs of at least s.
 * Considerations: Grids can be 23x23 (training) or 27x27 (test); colors vary (1-8, B=8 or 3); patterns may have irregular heights or partial fills; multiple blocks per row/column.
 * All attempts assume logo is placed in a grid-aligned, spaced manner, but fail on vertical alignment or skipping invalid placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies B, used in all attempts and works across examples.)

```python
def get_key_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    key_cols = []
    for c in range(1, min(10, n), 2):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for r in range(min(8, n))):
            key_cols.append(c)
    return key_cols
```
(This identifies odd-indexed key columns with signals in top rows; helpful for anchoring, works in train3.)

```python
def get_key_rows(g: List[List[int]], B: int, key_cols: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    rows = set()
    for r in range(min(8, len(g))):
        if any(g[r][c] != B for c in key_cols):
            rows.add(r)
    return sorted(rows)
```
(This finds key rows based on key cols; essential for extracting the key matrix, accurate in examples.)

```python
def get_key_colors(g: List[List[int]], key_rows: List[int], key_cols: List[int], B: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    m = len(key_rows)
    k = len(key_cols)
    kc = [[B] * k for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        r = key_rows[i]
        for j in range(k):
            kc[i][j] = g[r][key_cols[j]]
    return kc
```
(This extracts the m x k key pattern; core to getting colors for filling, works but ignores B in key if present.)

```python
def get_scale(g: List[List[int]], B: int, n: int) -> int:
    max_s = 1
    for row in g:
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if row[i] == B:
                i += 1
                continue
            start_color = row[i]
            j = i + 1
            while j < n and row[j] == start_color:
                j += 1
            length = j - i
            if length > max_s:
                max_s = length
            i = j
    return max_s
```
(This finds max non-B run length for block width s; helpful, but may overfit if runs vary; works for train3.)

```python
def get_main_start_cols(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, n: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = set()
    for r in range(n):
        i = 0
        while i <= n - s:
            if all(g[r][c] == g[r][i] != B for c in range(i, i + s)):
                starts.add(i)
            j = i
            while j < n and g[r][j] == g[r][i]:
                j += 1
            i = j
    return sorted(list(starts))
```
(This detects horizontal start positions for s-length non-B runs; useful for horizontal spacing, but buggy as it adds starts even if not full blocks vertically.)

```python
def get_block_info(g: List[List[int]], B: int, s: int, start_c: int, n: int) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    present_rows = []
    for r in range(n):
        if all(g[r][c] == g[r][start_c] != B for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            present_rows.append(r)
    if not present_rows:
        return None
    min_r = min(present_rows)
    max_r = max(present_rows)
    color = g[min_r][start_c]
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        if not all(g[r][c] == color for c in range(start_c, start_c + s)):
            return None
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    return (min_r, h, color)
```
(This validates vertical blocks at a start col, returning position, height, color if solid; helpful for detecting existing filled blocks, key to anchoring.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt (this program) correctly detects B, key rows/cols, and key colors in all cases, as seen in partial matches.
 * Worked well for train3 (fully correct), indicating core logic for spacing, scaling, and filling aligns sometimes when patterns are simple/aligned.
 * Failed train1: Generated extra 4's in row1 cols18-20 (not in expected, which has empty there); placed 1's in rows16-18 cols8-10 but expected has them empty (only side indicators); missed aligning lower 1's blocks to match expected positions in rows11-13 and16-18; overfilled some areas ignoring protection.
 * Failed train2: Missed placing 1's block in rows7-8 cols10-14 (expected has it, but generated only has side 1's and 3's); duplicated 3's in rows10-13 cols16-17 but expected has them only lower; failed to shift vertical placements correctly for middle rows; extra empty rows unfilled.
 * get_main_start_cols is helpful but buggy—adds starts per row without requiring vertical consistency, leading to incorrect spacing (e.g., assumes too many starts in train1/2).
 * get_block_info is essential and mostly correct, but skips invalid blocks; in train1/2, it under-detects filled blocks, causing wrong i_filled (defaults to 0, misaligning r_starts).
 * Protection logic (skip top/bottom if s==2 and B==8) is unhelpful/broken for train1 (B=8, s likely 3, but still overfills borders); not triggered in train2 (B=8? wait, train2 seems B=8, but no protection applied correctly).
 * Vertical shifting via i_filled and r_starts works in train3 but fails in train1/2 due to poor matching of key colors to blocks (uses max possible_i, but misses color consistency across h).
 * Horizontal block_starts truncate correctly but spacing (s + empty) assumes uniform gaps; in train1, diff-based empty=1? leads to overlaps/misplacements.
 * Overall, attempt understands extraction and scaling but mishandles vertical alignment and validation, causing partial/overfills in complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly identifies B=3, extracts keys (e.g., fills 1's in rows5-8 cols13-16,20-23 matching input hints), places scaled blocks (s likely 4, seen in 4x4 fills of 1,4,2), and uses spacing ~4+3=7 (e.g., blocks at cols13-16,20-23).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Overwrites/adds 8's in rows20-23 cols13-16 (input has empty 3's, but 8 may be invalid color for this grid—B=3, 8 seems out of place); misses filling some hinted areas like row3 col5=2 (remains isolated, not expanded to block); row5 col3=4 not expanded vertically/horizontally to match key; extra 1's in row5 col13-16 but input already has them, and it doesn't align all key rows (e.g., lower keys in rows15-18,20-23 partially filled but shifted wrong, adding 1's in row19? wait, row15-18 has 1's and 4's but expected likely needs consistent h=4 blocks); side indicators (cols1,3,5) preserved but logo blocks seem misaligned vertically (e.g., row20-23 8's block doesn't match any key color pattern).
 * Fills bottom rows20-23 with 8's block, but input has no such hint there—likely wrong color from key mismatch or invalid extraction; upper rows0-3 side fills (1,4,2) not blocked properly.
 * To handle test: Need better block validation (require full h consistency before filling), correct i_filled to min/max instead of max, and ignore/exclude B=3 in key_colors properly; spacing may need vertical detection too.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a 2D grid (likely representing a pixel art or pattern completion task) needs to be completed by filling background cells (most common color, e.g., 8 or 3) with colored rectangular blocks. The blocks are inferred from vertical "tracks" (odd-indexed columns with isolated non-background signals), horizontal runs of colors in signal rows, and propagating uniform block templates (of consistent height h and width w) forward/backward across the grid using specific step sizes and gaps, with a fallback mode for simple linear filling if no template is detected.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent color; non-bg cells in odd columns (tracks) must have isolated signals (max consecutive non-bg of 1 per column) to qualify as valid tracks—columns with longer runs or no signals are ignored.
 * Signal rows (srows) are rows with non-bg colors in tracks, but filter out color 8 (possibly a special/noise value); collect per-row color sequences from tracks as "sig_colors" lists, which form subsequences for matching block color patterns.
 * Block detection searches for horizontal templates: uniform rectangular blocks (height ph from 2 to n, width w from runs >=2 in a starting row sr) with consistent colors across height; the block's color sequence must be a subsequence of some sig_colors entry.
 * Propagation uses asymmetric steps: forward step_f = 2*h -1, backward step_b = 2*h +1; horizontal spacing via horiz_diff = 2*w -1, gap = horiz_diff - w; adjust template starts by extending/contracting based on color list lengths, and skip if out of bounds.
 * Subtlety: When propagating, d_step varies—if current num_b > next/prev len, use h, else use step_f/step_b; only fill bg cells (don't overwrite existing).
 * Extra forward pass if trailing sig_colors have uniform lengths: repeat last colors with step_f.
 * Fallback if no template found: fixed h=2, w=2, horiz_diff=5, step_f=5, starts at n//2, s=min(8,n)+h, linear forward filling with extensions; extra forward if all sig_colors same length.
 * Easy to miss: is_subsequence allows non-consecutive matching (e.g., [1,4] matches if 1 then later 4 in sig_colors); runs only consider >=2 length; uniform check requires exact color match across entire block height/width.
 * Grid size n x n (square, e.g., 23x23); outputs copy of input with fills.
 * Considerations: Overfilling (e.g., placing blocks where expected is bg) due to fallback triggering incorrectly; missing propagation direction or step miscalculation leads to gaps; subsequence matching may align wrong if multiple similar sig_colors.

        leng = i - start
        if leng >= 2:
            runs.append((start, leng, colr))
    return runs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly identifies bg, tracks, and sig_colors in all cases, and the template search with run-based uniform blocks works for train3 (exact match via propagation).
 * Worked: is_subsequence and find_runs enable accurate color matching and run detection; fallback partially handles linear patterns but overfills in train1/2.
 * Didn't work: Template search failed to find/align blocks in train1/2, triggering fallback which placed extra 1's in rows 16-18 of train1 (where expected all 8's) and extra 3's in rows 10/14 of train2 (expected 3's only in rows 10-11 and 13-14, but positions mismatched—generated row10 has 1's+3's but expected all 8's for row10? Wait, row indexing: generated overpropagated downward).
 * In train1, generated matches expected in upper/mid but adds unauthorized 1-blocks in lower empty areas (rows 16-18 cols 8-10/13-15), likely fallback misplacement.
 * In train2, generated adds extra 3's in row10 cols16-17 (expected all 8's there) and duplicates in row14 (expected has 3's but shifted?); misses vertical alignment for 3's in rows13-14.
 * Fallback is helpful for simple cases (train3) but broken for complex—overextends with fixed h=2/w=2/step=5, ignoring actual patterns, leading to irrelevant fills.
 * get_tracks is essential and correct (filters isolated signals well); get_valid_srows_and_colors useful but filters color=8 too aggressively (may miss if 8 is valid signal).
 * Propagation logic subtle but flawed: backward loop uses kk-1 to 0 but starts from found s, may skip/underfill; forward extra only if uniform lengths, but in train1/2 lengths vary (e.g., train1 sig_colors likely [4],[4],[4,4,4],[1,1,1] varying).
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided are relevant, but fallback block is not helpful (causes overfill; avoid or condition better).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it correctly leaves most bg=3 intact, fills isolated vertical signals (cols1,3,5 with 1/4/2) without extension, and attempts block fills like 1's in rows1-4 cols13-16/18-21 (matching a 4x4 pattern), 4's+2's in rows10-13 cols13-16/18-21, and 1's+4's in rows17-20 cols13-16/18-21, suggesting propagation from detected templates.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: upper fills (rows1-4) overwrite existing non-bg (e.g., row3 col5=2 remains but nearby 1's added; expected likely preserves isolated signals without merging). Lower fills (rows17-20) add 1's+4's where input has none, but input row17 all 3's—propagation may overextend if steps miscalculated (e.g., from row11-14 4/2 blocks, step_f=3? leads to row18ish). Misses potential backward fill from row5-6 1/4 signals. Extra 8 in row7 col1 seems erroneous (input 8? but bg=3, possibly noise). Overall, blocks align to tracks but heights/positions don't match input patterns (e.g., row11-14 should propagate 4/2 without changing to 1/4 below); likely fallback or wrong h=4 triggered incorrectly.
 * To handle test: Ensure template search starts from actual signal rows (e.g., row0-6,10-14,17-20); adjust steps for bg=3 grids (n=27? wider); verify subsequence matches don't skip varying lengths like [1,1,1,1] to [4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2].

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid filled mostly with a background color, where "key" indicators (non-background colors in specific positions, like odd rows and odd columns) specify colors and imply placements for rectangular (often square) blocks of uniform color. The goal is to detect existing blocks in the input grid and replicate or complete a pattern of similarly structured blocks (same size, spacing, and height) at shifted positions based on matching key sequences, without overwriting existing non-background content.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent color in the grid; all placements must avoid overwriting non-background cells and only fill pure background areas.
 * Key rows are typically odd-indexed (1-based or 0-based odd, e.g., rows 1,3,5,... up to the last with non-bg in odd columns); keys are extracted from odd columns (1,3,5,...) in these rows, ignoring background, to form color sequences per key row.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in a row; existing blocks are detected as vertically aligned runs across h consecutive rows starting from some row, with all runs in a "block group" having the same length w (often w == h for squares), same starting columns, and same color per run—but multiple runs side-by-side form a group with consistent structure.
 * Pattern replication: Find one "template" existing block group (multi-run if possible), extract its color sequence, size (h x w), and horizontal spacing d between run starts. Then, for each key row's color sequence, find the best-matching key row (subsequence match to template colors), compute a vertical shift delta based on key row index difference, and place shifted copies of the template block group (same colors, size, spacing) starting at vertical position = template_start_row + delta * d, but only if the target area is all background and within bounds.
 * Subtle elements: Block groups can have 1+ runs (k >=1, but code requires k>=2, missing singles); matching is subsequence (skipping non-matching keys), but greedy forward-only; if no exact multi-color match, fall back to single-color placements or detect multiple templates; size h/w must match (squares preferred, but train2 shows 2-high non-square?); avoid placing if target overlaps existing non-bg; key extraction skips even columns and bg; max key row is last odd row with any non-bg in odd columns; placements can be vertical shifts only, horizontal fixed from template; if no existing block found, copy input unchanged.
 * Edge cases: Single-run blocks (k=1) need handling (code misses, causing train1/2 failures); multiple template types (e.g., 4's and 1's separately); irregular spacing d (code assumes uniform from first two runs); blocks not starting in key rows; large n (test n=27, blocks 4x4); colors can repeat in sequence (e.g., [4,4]); placements may skip if out-of-bounds or not all-bg; preserve input keys and existing blocks exactly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt detects bg correctly, extracts keys from odd rows/columns accurately, finds runs and existing block groups well for multi-run squares (e.g., placed 4's in train1 upper), but fails to handle single-run (k<2) or multiple template types (e.g., misses 1's blocks in train1/2 expected, as no existing 1-template found; only replicates from one template).
 * Assumes w == h strictly (skips non-squares, but train2 expected has 2-high blocks); computes d only from first two block_starts (assumes uniform, misses irregular).
 * Placement logic shifts vertically by delta * d (good for pattern), checks all-bg before fill (prevents overwrite), but only places for the one best-matching key row (i_existing), missing placements for other key rows with partial/subsequence matches (e.g., train1 has multiple 1-key rows but no placement; train2 misplaced 2's/3's due to poor matching).
 * Train1 incorrect: Generated copies input with upper 4x3 blocks at rows1-3 cols8-10&13-15 (correct), but misses lower 3x3 1-blocks at rows6-8&11-13 cols8-10&13-15 (expected has them as replicated pattern; code skips due to no existing 1-template and k=2 req); also row6/11 have single 1's in keys but no block fill.
 * Train2 incorrect: Generated adds extra/misplaced 2's at rows4-5 cols10-12&14-15 (not in expected), 1's blocks at rows7-8&13-14 cols10-11&14-15 (partial match), but 3's at rows10-11&13-14 cols16-17 (shifted wrong), and 2's at rows10-11 cols19-20 (partial); expected has precise 2-high 1/2/3 blocks at specific positions without extras—code's greedy match picks wrong i_existing or over-places.
 * Train3 correct: Likely had a single matching template with k>=2, uniform d, square w=h, and one key row match, so placed correctly (unknown input, but code succeeded).
 * find_existing_blocks is helpful for detecting templates but broken for k=1, non-uniform w, or multiple templates (only returns first found; suggest modify to return list of templates).
 * get_line_colors and find_i_existing are helpful for key extraction/matching but not sufficient—matching too loose (allows skipping, leading to wrong i_existing in train2); suggest stricter exact-subsequence or multiple matches per template.
 * Overall, code preserves input well (copies if invalid/no template), but lacks fallback for no-template cases (e.g., infer size from keys or assume default square).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially looks correct: It copies input (small 1/4/2/8 placements in upper rows 1/3/5/7 match expected keys), and correctly fills a 4x4 block of 4's at rows10-13 cols13-16 and 4x4 of 2's at rows10-13 cols18-21 (appears as replicated pattern from some template, with d=5? between starts 13 and 18), assuming input had no existing there but keys implied it. However, it does not look fully correct—upper single keys (e.g., row1:1's at cols1/3/5; row3:4/4/2 at1/3/5?; row5:1/4/1) suggest additional small blocks (1x1 or 2x2?) should be placed lower (e.g., shifted like train1's 1's), but nothing added below row7 (all 3's from row14+); row7 has 8 (odd color, perhaps key or existing) unfilled into block. Misses potential replications for 1/4/2 sequences (e.g., no 1-blocks or 2-high like train2), likely due to no matching existing template for singles/multi or w!=h skip; output has no extras/overwrites, but incomplete pattern (e.g., if keys imply more vertical shifts, rows14+ should have blocks but are blank—doesn't make sense for full puzzle completion).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a uniform background color, sparse "signals" (non-background cells) placed in specific vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns with isolated single-cell signals), and partial horizontal blocks of uniform colors. The goal is to detect signal sequences per affected row, identify block heights and spacings from existing patterns, and fill in missing vertical stacks of horizontal blocks to complete a repeating or extrapolated pattern that matches the signal color sequences as subsequences, while preserving existing content and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the dominant color (often 1 or 3), but must be reliably detected (e.g., from fully uniform rows); avoid assuming it's always the smallest number.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (typically odd indices like 1,3,5) where signals appear as isolated single non-background cells (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); multiple signals per column are invalid for track qualification.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one signal in a track; extract unique colors from signals in those rows (ignoring bg), forming a sequence per row that must be matched as a subsequence by block colors.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect their start-end ranges and check for uniform height (h) across all blocks—if uniform, use for anchoring; blocks must be vertically uniform in color when stacked.
 * Anchoring: If existing blocks form a valid stack of height h that matches a signal row's color subsequence, use it to compute vertical step (often 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and base position; otherwise, default to h= spacing between first two signal rows, step=2*h +1 or similar, and center blocks horizontally.
 * Filling: Extrapolate vertically for each signal row (skipping if already anchored), placing stacks of h-high blocks at horizontal positions derived from initial/current ranges, spaced by horizontal distance (e.g., from block starts); only fill bg cells, match colors to signal sequence, truncate if out of bounds.
 * Subtleties: Vertical positioning must align precisely with signal rows (e.g., base + i*step_v); misalignment shifts entire stacks (e.g., placing row10 content at row14). Horizontal spacing (distance_h) should derive from existing blocks (e.g., start diff) or default to 2*h +1; overextending temp_ranges can add extra blocks. Preserve existing non-bg (don't overwrite). If no tracks/signals/blocks, return copy unchanged. Single-block or no-match cases default to centered or minimal filling. Ensure blocks are uniform vertically when checking/creating. Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., signal [2,3] matches blocks [x,2,y,3] but not reverse order).
 * Edge cases: Odd-sized grids (23x23 in train3/test?); signals not starting at top; multiple block widths (fallback to signal spacing); tracks not every odd column; blocks wrapping or adjacent; h=1 possible but rare (since blocks >=2 wide, but height separate).
 * All considerations: Detect only isolated signals to avoid noise; sorted signal rows for indexing; copy grid to avoid mutating input; handle empty lists gracefully; validate block uniformity across full h rows; compute step_v consistently (2*h -1 if anchored, else 2*h +1); base row from anchor or center (size//2 - h +1); limit num blocks to min(signal len, available space).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[:] for row in g]
```
(Copies grid safely for output.)

    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            return row[0]
    return g[0][0]
```
(Reliably finds bg from uniform row or top-left; helpful for noisy grids.)

```python

            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(Extracts valid signal tracks: odd columns with only single isolated non-bg cells; essential for identifying signal columns.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    signal_set = set()

                break
    return sorted(list(signal_set))
```
(Finds rows with signals in tracks; crucial for sequencing.)

    for i in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[i][j] for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(Extracts per-signal-row color sequences from tracks; key for subsequence matching.)

                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
    return sorted(list(ranges_set))
```
(Collects unique horizontal block positions (width >=2); useful for detecting patterns but note: doesn't capture colors or verticality directly—pair with other funcs.)

```python

    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0

            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence check; vital for matching signal colors to block sequences, allowing skips.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single provided) correctly handled train1 and train2, likely simpler cases with clear anchoring or default spacing, demonstrating core detection of bg, tracks, signals, and basic filling.
 * Failed train3: Generated output misplaced vertical stacks—e.g., expected 2,2/3,3 blocks at rows 10-11, but placed at 14-15; expected 3,3/3,3 at 15-16, but placed at 17-18; extra/misaligned 3,3/4,4 at 20-21 (matches expected position but possibly wrong colors or widths). Rows 12-14 expected all bg (1), but row14 filled incorrectly. Upper signals/blocks (rows 1,3,5) matched expected. Likely cause: Faulty base computation or step_v (used 2*h +1 default, misaligning when no anchor found); or incorrect distance_h leading to wrong horizontal extension. Unknown why anchoring failed (possibly no uniform h or subsequence match in train3 blocks).
 * Over-reliance on default h from signal_rows[1]-signal_rows[0] (set to 2?) caused vertical shift; when found_anchor=False, centered blocks but with wrong step_v=2*h+1 instead of matching expected spacing (appears ~5 rows apart in train3).
 * get_block_ranges is helpful for positions but incomplete alone (needs color/uniformity check in anchoring loop, which is present but buggy—e.g., invalid start/end checks, assumes sorted ranges for distance_h= block_ranges[1][0] - block_ranges[0][0]).
 * Anchoring logic is partially useful but broken: Assumes single width, checks uniformity only after assuming h=w (wrong, h is vertical); distance_h from first two blocks may not generalize; skips filling anchor row (i==k continue) but may need to verify/fix it.
 * Default block placement (centered at size//2, step=2*h+1) works for simple cases but fails when signals are sparse/irregular vertically.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though anchoring block validation is flawed (e.g., uniform check nested poorly, block_colors append per range but used as flat list for subsequence).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears misaligned/incomplete, similar to train3 failure. It fills irregular blocks in rows 3-6 (e.g., row3: 4 at col1,4 at col3,2 at col5; row5:1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) which may overfill or mismatch signals (e.g., introduces 8 at row7 col1, possibly bg overwrite error). Later, rows 10-13 have stacked 4s (cols13-16) and 2s (cols18-21), but widths=4 (not >=2 uniform?); rows 17-20 have 1s (cols13-16) and 4s (cols18-21), stacked 4-high, suggesting h=4 detection but vertical positions likely shifted (e.g., if signals at specific rows, stacks don't align). Upper rows 0-2,7-9,14-16,22-26 mostly bg (3), but scattered signals unfilled properly. Overall, pattern looks like attempted vertical extrapolation but with wrong base/step (e.g., blocks start too late or wrong colors—1s/4s may not match signal sequences). Without input grid, can't confirm exact signals, but fillings seem excessive/non-uniform vertically and don't preserve isolation; likely wrong distance_h or temp_ranges extension added unneeded blocks. To handle test, need better anchoring (detect h from vertical stacks, not widths) and precise step_v (e.g., match min spacing between signal rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a square grid of colored cells (integers representing colors, with a dominant background color like 8 or 3), where the task is to detect and extend vertical stacks of uniform horizontal blocks based on "signals" in odd-numbered columns that act as sparse guides or tracks, while avoiding over-extension or duplication of patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common cell value; all operations ignore or skip it unless placing new blocks.
 * Identify "runs" as horizontal sequences of 2+ identical non-background cells in a row.
 * Detect the "best stack": the tallest (hh) vertical group of rows starting at ss, where each row has the same-width (ww >=2) non-bg runs at consistent positions, all filled with the same color per block across the height.
 * Odd columns (1,3,5,...) serve as "tracks" for signals: only if they have isolated (max consecutive non-bg ==1) non-bg cells, indicating valid signal columns; no tracks means no changes.
 * Signal rows are unique rows with non-bg in tracks; signal colors are lists of non-8 (or non-bg?) non-bg values from those tracks in a row, excluding 8 specifically in the code (subtle: 8 might be a special "ignore" color even if not bg).
 * Match signals to the best stack's block colors to find a "key" signal row (kk) with the best partial or full sequence match; use this to infer a vertical step (step_v) from block start positions (gap_h = step_v - ww).
 * Extend by placing copies of the key stack's structure at offset positions (pos = best_s + delta * step_v) for other signal rows (i != kk), using their signal colors to fill only bg cells; skip if out of bounds.
 * Extra forward extension: If all signal color lists have the same length, repeatedly append new stacks downward using the last signal's colors, but only if space allows; this seems to cause over-extension in some cases.
 * Subtle: Only fill if target cell is bg; don't overwrite existing non-bg. Blocks must be uniform in color and width across the stack height.
 * Handles multiple blocks per row/stack, with starts derived from key and extended via gaps.
 * Edge cases: No best stack or no tracks/signals = return unchanged grid. If <2 starts, default step_v = ww +1 (assuming single block with gap). Matching allows partial (greedy forward match), but requires exact sequence order.
 * Potential miss: Signals exclude 8 even if not bg; in test, bg=3, so 8 might be treated as signal but code excludes it. Isolated signals mean no vertical runs >1 in tracks.
 * Over-extension risk: The "extra forward" logic duplicates the last pattern indefinitely if lengths uniform, but should stop at grid end or lack of signals.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant bg color.)

```python
def find_runs(row: List[int], bg: int, n: int) -> List[tuple]:
    runs = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if row[i] == bg:
            i += 1
            continue
        start = i
        col = row[i]
        while i < n and row[i] == col:
            i += 1
        leng = i - start
        if leng >= 2:
            runs.append((start, leng, col))
    return runs
```
(This extracts horizontal runs of >=2 non-bg cells, useful for detecting block structures; returns (start, length, color).)

(The best stack detection loop is helpful but buggy in extension; signal extraction and matching logic captures core idea of using tracks for guidance.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Incorrect; generated output duplicated the 1-block stacks (positions 8-10 and 13-15) into rows 15-17 (0-based), filling bg=8 cells with 1's where expected output leaves them as 8's (all-empty rows); this over-extended the pattern downward without corresponding signals.
 * Training example 1: Expected output preserves the existing partial stacks (e.g., rows 1-3 with 4's, row 5 with isolated 1's, rows 6-8 with 1's) but adds nothing extra; generated matched existing but added unwarranted lower blocks, likely from faulty "extra forward" logic triggering on uniform signal lengths.
 * Training examples 2 and 3: Correct, indicating the core detection of best stack, tracks, and basic placement works when signals align without needing extra extension.
 * Missed stopping condition for extensions: In training 1, uniform signal lengths (all len=2 for 1-signals?) triggered indefinite forward filling, but expected has gaps/empty rows, suggesting extensions should only align to existing signals, not extrapolate beyond.
 * Signal matching is partial/greedy but worked in 2/3 cases; in training 1, it may have mismatched or over-applied the key (kk) based on the 1-signals.
 * Tracks detection correctly identifies odd columns with only isolated non-bg (maxcon==1), which prevented changes when absent.
 * The "extra forward if all same length" logic is unhelpful/broken: it caused the duplication in training 1 and should be removed or conditioned on actual signals continuing; don't use it in future attempts.
 * Best stack search (tallest hh with uniform ww blocks) is essential and worked, but extension assumes periodic vertical stepping which fails when signals are sparse/gapped.
 * get_background and find_runs are helpful and correct; the stack consistency check (cons) is key for validating uniform blocks.
 * In training 1, lower signals (rows 11-13,17-19 with 1's) were not extended from, but code tried to place from mismatched kk, leading to extras.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it preserves existing structures (e.g., isolated 1/4/2 in early rows, 1/2/4 blocks in rows 5-8 and 10-13) but adds new blocks like 1's in rows 5-8 (cols 13-16,19-22), 4's/2's in rows 10-13 (cols 13-16,18-21), and duplicates 1/4 blocks in rows 15-18 and 20-23, which may over-extend without clear signal justification.
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Expected likely only fills gaps in existing stack patterns (e.g., complete the 1/4 blocks in rows 5-8 using signals from odd cols like 1,3,5 with isolated 1/4/2/8, but ignore 8; extend vertically only where signals match sequence, without duplicating entire lower sections like rows 15+ which have no corresponding upper signals).
 * The output fills bg=3 cells in new positions (e.g., row 5 cols 13-16 with 1's, matching a signal pattern?), but extras in rows 20-23 seem like erroneous forward extension similar to training 1 error; this doesn't make sense as those rows lack any signals in tracks (odd cols are all 3's there).
 * Tracks in test: Odd cols (1,3,5,...) have isolated non-3 (e.g., col1: 1's at rows1,5; col3:1/4 at rows1,3,5; col5:1/2/4/1 at various), but maxcon=1 holds; however, output ignores some 8's (row7 col1=8 excluded correctly) but over-places blocks not aligned to all signals.
 * To handle test: Limit placements to only delta positions with actual signals (no blind forward); match full sequences more strictly; the generated has too many filled blocks in lower empty areas, suggesting the extra forward logic fired incorrectly on uniform lengths (e.g., multiple len=4 signal lists).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving a background color (bg), vertical signal tracks in odd-numbered columns (1-based indexing) that contain isolated single non-bg cells (no consecutive signals in the column), and horizontal blocks of uniform non-bg color (length >=2) that suggest a repeating pattern of colored rectangles. The goal is to identify signal rows (rows with signals in tracks), extract color sequences from those signals, detect an initial "anchor" vertical stack of blocks that matches a subsequence of one signal row's colors, and then propagate (place) similar blocks forward and backward across the grid using specific spacing rules (e.g., diagonal-like steps) to complete the pattern, while preserving existing content and only filling bg areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is reliably detected from the first uniform row (all same color), but assume it's consistent across the grid; non-uniform rows may contain signals or partial blocks.
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (j=1,3,5,...) where the column has at least one non-bg cell, but crucially, no more than one consecutive non-bg (max_consec==1), ensuring "isolated signals"; even columns or columns with streaks are ignored.
 * Signal rows are the unique rows containing any signal in a track; they are sorted, and each signal row's color sequence is the ordered non-bg colors from left-to-right tracks (skipping bg).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start_col, end_col) ranges across all rows, sort them, and assume uniform height h from the first block's width (h = end-start+1); this h is fixed for all placements.
 * Anchor detection: Scan possible starting rows s for a vertical stack of h rows where each block range is fully uniform color c across the entire height (no mismatches); collect candidate block colors [c for each range]; check if this is a subsequence of some signal row k's colors using is_subsequence (order matters, allowing skips in the signal but not in blocks).
 * Propagation: Once anchor s and k found, extend block_ranges rightward if needed to match longest signal sequence (new blocks spaced by h-1 bg columns? but code uses last_end +1 + (h-1), which may overextend).
 * Forward filling: From anchor, step down by d=2*h-1 rows per signal step i, placing blocks with colors from signal row k+i; clip if out of bounds.
 * Backward filling: More complex—default d_back=2*h+1 upward steps from anchor for previous signals k-i; but if max signal row < s (signals above anchor?), use "special" mode with d_internal=2*h, computing a starting row via formula involving max_s and p=k_filled, placing in a tight-packed way if it fits below s without overlap; this handles cases where signals are clustered above the anchor.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., single signals between block colors), but blocks must match exactly in order; placements only overwrite bg, but code's place() overwrites everything (potential bug if overlapping existing non-bg); h is assumed from first block but must be consistent; tracks may have varying numbers of signals per row; if no anchor or signals/blocks, return grid unchanged; odd columns only for tracks (even for blocks? blocks can span any columns); potential for multiple anchors, but code takes first valid.
 * Edge cases: No signals/blocks (return as-is); signals only above/below anchor; extended blocks may go off-grid; special backward only if signals end before anchor row; color 1 often bg, but generalize; grid size N x N, assume square.
 * All attempts consider overwriting only bg implicitly via pattern matching, but code doesn't check—may cause artifacts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def is_subsequence(a: tp.List[int], b: tp.List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return False
```
(This is helpful: standard subsequence check, allows skips in b (signals) but requires exact order match in a (blocks); used to validate anchor against signal colors.)

```python
def place(out: tp.List[tp.List[int]], start_r: int, h: int, c_list: tp.List[int], block_ranges: tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int]], size: int):
    if start_r < 0 or start_r + h > size:
        return
    num = min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges))
    for bb in range(num):
        cs, ce = block_ranges[bb]
        c = c_list[bb]
        for r in range(start_r, start_r + h):
            for cc in range(cs, ce + 1):
                out[r][cc] = c
```
(This is helpful: Fills rectangular blocks vertically over h rows; limits to min(len(c_list), len(block_ranges)) to avoid index errors; but note it overwrites existing cells without checking if bg, which could corrupt if misaligned.)

(The core program() function extracts bg, tracks, signal_rows, block_ranges, finds anchor s/k, extends ranges, and propagates forward/backward; extractions are modular and reusable, e.g., signal_rows = sorted(set(i for i in range(size) for j in tracks if g[i][j] != bg)).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full pattern completion with proper spacing and colors), demonstrating core understanding of signals, blocks, anchor matching via subsequence, and forward/backward propagation.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output placed backward blocks shifted upward by 1 row (e.g., row 14 has 3's in columns 11-12 and 16-17 where expected row 14 is all 1's/bg, and expected row 15 has those 3's; generated row 15 duplicates them, causing overlap/extra fill); forward placements (e.g., row 20-21 with 3's and 4's) match expected, but backward misaligns, likely due to bug in special backward logic (d_internal=2*h=4? miscomputing start0 or current stepping, placing too high); unknown if h=2 assumed correctly, but blocks are height 2 in expected.
 * Anchor detection worked (found s=1? for early blocks matching signal subsequence), as early rows (1,3,5) match expected.
 * Track extraction likely correct (columns 1,3 for signals 2,3,4 etc.).
 * Block_ranges extraction correct (e.g., (11,12) for 2's/3's, (16,17) for 3's/4's).
 * Extension of block_ranges not triggered (m=2, max_needed~3? but didn't overextend visibly).
 * Forward propagation correct (d=2*2-1=3, stepping from anchor to place at rows 20-21).
 * Backward propagation buggy: default d_back=5 places too far, special mode activates (max_s=5? < s=6?), but formula temp = s + max_s +1 -h -(p-1)*d_internal miscalculates start0, leading to upward shift; use_special condition (max_s < s_filled) catches clustering but stepping fails.
 * is_subsequence is correct and essential for anchor validation.
 * place() is helpful but unhelpful in not checking/only-filling bg—contributes to overwrite errors if misaligned.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the special backward computation (temp //2 etc.) is broken/complex and not handling all cases (e.g., doesn't fit last_end < s_filled properly, causing invalid placements).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly detects bg=3, tracks (likely columns 1,3,5,13?,19? with isolated 1,4,2,1 signals in early rows), signal rows (e.g., 1,3,5,10-13?,17-20?), block_ranges (e.g., (13,16) for 4's, (18,21) for 2's/4's, h=4 from width 4 blocks in rows 10-13), and places some forward/backward blocks (e.g., early row 3 col1=4, row5 col3=4 matching signals; rows 10-13 filled with 4's and 2's per subsequence; rows 17-20 with 4's). However, anomalies include row7 col1=8 (unexplained color, possibly extraction error or invalid placement); row1-5 have scattered 1's/4/2 in even/odd cols but incomplete (e.g., no full blocks, and row5 ends abruptly without propagating further); backward from anchor (likely s~5-6) places rows17-20 but skips/ignores upper signals (rows1-5 signals not fully backward-filled, e.g., no blocks above row1); extension may have added invisible off-grid ranges; overall, spacing inconsistent (d=2*4-1=7 forward steps too large for dense signals, causing gaps/misses); does not match a clean zigzag pattern—likely same backward bug as train3 shifts or skips, and place() overwrites non-bg (e.g., row8 col1=8 corrupts?); expected should have more complete upper/lower blocks matching all signal sequences (e.g., propagate 1-4-2 from row1 signals across h=4 blocks spaced ~7 rows, but generated misses vertical uniformity in placements); account for larger h=4 and more tracks (6+?) to handle test density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves a grid where a background color dominates, with "tracks" (specific columns showing isolated signals) defining signal rows and colors that guide the extension of uniform horizontal "blocks" (non-background segments of consistent length and color) across the grid in a patterned, bidirectional manner from an anchor point. The goal is to propagate these blocks forward and backward using calculated steps based on block height, signal complexity, and gaps, while preserving existing elements and only filling background areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the first uniform row (all cells identical); if none, default to top-left cell—ensure this handles partial uniformity without overgeneralizing.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (1-based? code uses 1,3,... ) that contain non-background cells but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); this filters out continuous blocks and ensures signals are "point-like" for detection.
 * Signal rows are those with at least one non-bg in a track column; signal colors are the sequence of non-bg values in tracks for that row, ordered by track position—subtle: colors must be extracted only from tracks, ignoring bg gaps.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of >=2 identical non-bg cells in any row; all blocks must share the same height h (end-start+1) for validity, or the grid is returned unchanged—easy to miss inconsistent heights breaking propagation.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a starting row s where existing blocks (uniform vertically over h rows) match a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors propagation—subtle: blocks must be uniform in color across h rows and columns, and the subsequence match must be exact via is_subsequence (which allows non-contiguous matching in the signal).
 * Propagation uses gaps between existing blocks; forward/backward steps are base (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) plus additions for increasing signal complexity (len(signal_colors[next]) - previous); only place in bg areas, and limit to grid bounds.
 * Subtleties: If no tracks, signals, or blocks, return grid unchanged; propagation stops at bounds; temp ranges extrapolate blocks beyond existing ones using gap, but cap at needed number; easy to miss over-placement (e.g., writing over non-bg) or incorrect step calculation leading to misalignment.
 * All blocks in anchor must match one signal's subsequence exactly; multiple signals may share subsequence patterns, but anchor picks the first valid.
 * Generated outputs must exactly match expected in positions/colors; even subtle shifts (e.g., wrong step size) cause full mismatch.
 * Considerations: Odd columns only for tracks (code assumes this); signals can repeat colors; blocks can be in even/odd columns but are horizontal; vertical uniformity required for anchor blocks.

(Handles gap calculation, extrapolated ranges for more blocks than existing, and safe placement only in bg; useful for propagation but watch for over-extrapolation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 correct: Successfully detected tracks, signals, blocks, anchor, and propagated forward/backward with correct steps, matching expected grid exactly.
 * Training example 2 incorrect: Generated grid places blocks like 1's and 3's in positions (e.g., rows 7-8, 11-12, 14-15) that mostly match expected, but subtle differences exist—e.g., in generated, row 11 has 3's at columns 16-17 while expected has them there too, but overall labeled incorrect, possibly due to extra/misplaced 3's in backward propagation or step miscalculation (e.g., base_db=2h+1 leading to overlap or skip); unknown exact mismatch but propagation from anchor failed to align perfectly with expected block positions.
 * Training example 3 correct: Handled complex signal colors and multiple blocks well, with proper gap-based extrapolation and bound checking.
 * Anchor finding works when blocks are vertically uniform and subsequence matches, but may fail if search order misses the right s/kk or if uniform check is too strict (e.g., partial overlaps).
 * Step calculation (base_df=2h-1, base_db=2h+1 + add for len diff) succeeds in simple cases but likely over/under-steps in train 2, causing block shifts (e.g., 3's appearing one row too high/low).
 * Block height consistency check prevents invalid propagation, which is good—avoids changes when h varies.
 * is_subsequence is helpful for loose matching but may allow unintended anchors if signals have repeated colors.
 * get_temp_ranges extrapolates correctly for more blocks needed, but if gap=0 or small, can crowd placements.
 * Overall, detection of bg/tracks/signals/blocks is solid (passes 2/3 trains), but propagation logic (steps, direction) needs tuning for varying signal lengths.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places blocks like 1's in rows 1-5 (columns 1,3,13-16,19-22,24-27?), 4's/2's in row 3 (cols 1,3,5?), and larger 1/4/2 blocks in rows 10-13 and 17-20, but this does not look fully correct—e.g., early signals (rows 1-5 with 1/2/4 in tracks) suggest propagation from an anchor, but placements overwrite or misalign with existing non-bg (e.g., row 5 has 1/4 but generated fills row 5 with 1's in block areas that might overlap signals); later blocks in rows 10-13 (4's/2's) and 17-20 (1's/4's) seem extrapolated but positions (e.g., cols 13-16 for 1's, 18-21 for 4's/2's) may not match expected gaps/steps from bg=3 patterns.
 * Missing symmetry or bidirectional fill—e.g., signals in rows 1-5 and 17-20 suggest anchors around middle empty rows (6-9,14-16), but generated fills row 7 with 8 (unrelated color?) which shouldn't appear (bg=3, no 8 in input); this indicates color leak or wrong signal_colors extraction.
 * Over-placement: Row 2-3/5 have repeated 1's in cols 13-27 that extend existing but add extras (e.g., col 24-27 1's in row 2 not in input), violating "only fill bg"; looks like place_blocks ignores existing non-bg checks in some spots.
 * Does not make complete sense—propagation seems partial (e.g., no fills in rows 6-9 despite potential backward from row 10 blocks), and colors like 8 in row 7 suggest bg detection failure or copy error; expected likely extends early signals downward and late blocks upward with consistent h=4 (seen in input blocks), but generated has irregular heights and positions.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where the goal is to identify the background color, detect large filled rectangular "blocks" of the same foreground color (connected components that form solid rectangles larger than 1x1), and then add new rectangular blocks of specific colors in calculated positions relative to the original blocks, often duplicating patterns or extending them based on rules like spacing, special markers, or color hierarchies. The additions seem to follow symmetry, repetition, or positional logic (e.g., offsets from center or original positions) while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 in training example 2, 3 in test input); foreground starts with the minimum non-background color (min_fg), and higher colors may be used for variations or special cases.
 * Large blocks are strictly filled rectangles (no holes or irregular shapes); they must be connected components of the same color with size >1, fully occupying their bounding box (w * h == component_size), detected via flood-fill-like stack traversal with bounding box checks.
 * Positions for new blocks: Often calculated as offsets (e.g., step=5) above/below the original y1 position, preferring downward if possible, falling back to upward; if special conditions (e.g., unusual colors left of blocks), use center-based positioning with steps derived from special colors.
 * Special cases: Detect "special" elements (colors neither bg, large_color, nor min_fg) left of the leftmost block in the original block's rows; if present, use that color as a step offset and add extra blocks (e.g., one with special color to the right of existing blocks). If bg==8 or special flag, use min_fg for most additions; otherwise, use color progression (min_fg for one side, next_min for the other) and handle multiple blocks differently (e.g., farthest position gets split colors).
 * For multiple blocks: Assume they share height h; add corresponding rectangles for each, but vary colors based on distance or position (e.g., closer gets uniform next_min, farthest gets min_fg left + next_min right).
 * Subtleties: Additions must not exceed grid bounds (0 <= p and p + h -1 < n); if fewer than 2 positions possible, may skip or adjust. In special mode (bg==8 or has_special), add extra right-side block with special_c only for non-first positions. Ensure no overwriting of existing non-bg cells unintentionally. Easy to miss: Rectangularity requires explicit filled check after bounding box; single-cell or non-rectangular connected components are ignored. Color candidates for next_min exclude bg and are > min_fg.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases with no blocks (return original grid). For len(added_pos)==2 and >=2 blocks, split colors by "farthest" from original_y1. If positions can't fit 2, may default to uniform min_fg additions. Test input has bg=3, min_fg=1, large blocks of 4 (rows 10-13, cols 13-16) and 2 (rows 10-13 cols 18-21, and rows 15-18 cols 13-16 & 18-21), but scattered small 1/2/4/8 elsewhere—additions should target positions around original_y1=10, h=4, potentially adding upward/downward with step=5, but check for special (e.g., 8 in row7 col1 is isolated, may trigger special if left of min_x1).

(Helpful: Safely adds rectangles without bound errors, overwriting as needed.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct—properly detected blocks, positions, and colors, adding uniform min_fg rectangles without special case issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect—failed to add a 1-block at row 7 (positions ~10-15 cols for the second block set), where expected has [...,1,1,8,1,1,8,...] but generated has all 8s there; also row 9 generated matches expected but row 7 does not, suggesting miscalculation of added_pos (likely only added at rows 8 and 10-13, missing an upward position or special handling for the 3's as markers); later rows (10-13,15-18) correctly added 1's and 3's, but the gap in row 7 indicates incomplete position list or skipped addition for one block set. Next_min logic (using 3 after min_fg=1) worked for right-side, but left-side uniform 1's were partially missed.
 * Training example 3: Correct—handled multiple blocks and color splitting (min_fg left, next_min right) for farthest position, likely with 2 added_pos fitting perfectly.
 * Overall: Works when no special (has_special=False) and positions fit downward; breaks on upward additions or when len(added_pos)==2 requires distinguishing farthest/closer for color assignment, especially with bg!=8. find_large_blocks is robust and essential (correctly ignores small 1/2/3 cells, focuses on rects like the 1's and 2's in ex2). calculate_normal_positions may be buggy for cases needing exactly 2 positions (e.g., in ex2, it tried down but fell back incompletely, missing row7= original_y1-5? since original_y1~5? wait, ex2 blocks at y=4-5 (2's), y=7-8 (1's), y=10-11 (1's), y=12-13? but code assumes single h, takes first block's—potential issue if multiple h). has_special detected 3 correctly but positioning/special addition (right-side with 3) only applied partially (missed for one pos). No unhelpful functions noted, but the main program logic for color assignment when !special and multiple blocks assumes blocks[0] and blocks[1] specifically, which may not generalize if >2 blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly identifies bg=3, min_fg=1, and large blocks (e.g., 4-block at rows10-13 cols13-16 w=4 h=4; 2-blocks at rows10-13 cols18-21, rows15-18 cols13-21 split but connected? wait, rows15-18 has two 2-rects separated by 3's, but code detects as separate if not same-color connected—assuming it found them as two blocks sharing h=4). Additions include 1-rects at rows20-23 cols13-16 &18-21 (down from original_y1=10 by ~10, but step=5 would suggest 15&20—row15 already has 2's, so overwrote?), and 2-rects extended or duplicated at rows15-18 (but expected might need uniform 1's or special handling). However, it misses potential upward additions (e.g., around row5=10-5, but row5-8 are mostly empty—could add there with 1's), and row0-9 have no additions despite scattered small 1/4/2/8 (e.g., row7 col1=8 might be special if min_x1~13, c=8 !=3,!=4(large),!=1(min_fg), so has_special=True, step=8, center~13, positions like 13-8=5,13,13+8=21—but h=4, 21+3=24<27 ok, but generated has no such center-based adds, stuck to normal_positions which for y1=10 gives p=15,20 but 15 already occupied). Also, generated has 1's only low (rows20-23), 2's mid-low, but no 4's duplicated, and special 8 not used for right-add (e.g., no extra block at x~13+8=21 with color8). Differences: Expected likely needs special-triggered center adds (e.g., 4-rect at row5 cols13-16 color1, row13 cols13-16 color1, plus right-add at col21-24 color8 for non-first pos), and handle multiple 2-blocks without overwriting existing 2's at row15; generated overwrote/ignored some, missing upward and right-special, so incomplete pattern extension.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving detection and replication of horizontal block patterns (anchors) across multiple rows, guided by "key" sequences extracted from specific rows and columns, to fill in missing or implied parts of the grid while preserving the background and avoiding overwriting existing non-background elements. The goal is to identify repeating block structures and propagate them vertically using patterned stepping, matching color sequences from keys to ensure correct placement.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most common color; all placements must respect it by only overwriting bg cells, never existing non-bg cells.
 * Horizontal runs are sequences of identical non-bg cells of length >=2; anchors require identical run starts, lengths (>=2), and colors repeating for at least h=2 consecutive rows.
 * Key columns are odd-indexed (1,3,5,7,9) with any non-bg in the first 8 rows; key rows are those with non-bg in key columns (first 8 rows); key colors are non-bg, non-8 values from key row-key col intersections, forming per-row color lists that act as sequence guides.
 * Anchor selection prioritizes tallest h, then earliest start row s, and requires block colors to be a subsequence of some key color list; spacing (diff) between blocks is derived from starts or defaults to w+2 if single block.
 * Placement for other keys uses delta-based stepping: step_down=2*h-1 for below, step_up=2*h+1 for above; extend block starts rightward using anchor_diff if key sequence is longer than anchor blocks.
 * Subtle: Exclude color 8 from keys (possibly a special marker or invalid for replication); single-block anchors use w+2 as diff; only place if target row range fits grid; subsequence matching allows partial embeds (e.g., anchor colors subset of key).
 * Grids may have size >8 (up to 27x27 in test), but keys limited to first 8 rows/cols; patterns may not span full width; replication only for matching subsequences, skipping if out-of-bounds or no match.
 * Potential misses: Wrong anchor selection (e.g., picking a shorter/wrong-color repeat); incorrect stepping leading to overlap or misplacement; failing to extend blocks for longer keys; not handling isolated non-repeating patterns.
 * All attempts assume rectangular grid input/output; preserve existing non-bg (only fill bg).

```
(Note: get_key_cols, get_key_rows, get_key_colors, find_anchor are helpful but buggy in current form—e.g., find_anchor has return tuple mismatch and incomplete extension logic; use as base but fix.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
 * The current find_anchor: Broken return (appends extra h, slices to 6 but expects 7); assumes uniform w across blocks (fails if varied); diff calculation assumes >=2 blocks or defaults poorly; doesn't handle multiple possible anchors well (picks by h then s, but may miss best subsequence match).
 * get_key_colors: Excludes 8 arbitrarily (works for train1 bg=8 but may be puzzle rule); filters only key_cols but ignores full row context.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) passed training examples 2 and 3 fully (correct outputs match expected, demonstrating core anchor detection, key extraction, and stepping work for those cases).
 * Failed training example 1: Generated output incorrectly placed 4-colored blocks in rows 6-8 (positions ~8-10 and ~13-15) where expected has 1's; also placed extra 4's in rows 11-13 third block where expected has 4's but mismatched prior (actually, rows 11-13 third block is correct as 4's, but rows 6-8 wrong color suggests anchor mismatch—likely picked a 4-based anchor instead of 1-based, or wrong ki assignment; rows 16-18 correctly placed 1's, but overall incomplete as lower empty rows stayed empty correctly).
 * What worked: Background detection (8 in train1, 3 in test); run extraction for anchors; subsequence matching to keys; basic placement without overwriting; stepping logic positioned blocks vertically correctly in passing cases (e.g., delta-based row calc).
 * What didn't: Anchor selection suboptimal (chose wrong h/s/ki in train1, leading to color swap 4->1 error); block extension in placement loop caps at min(len(temp_starts), m) but may not pad correctly for short anchors/long keys; key_colors exclude 8 (helped train1 but unclear if general); no handling for non-uniform block widths or single-block diffs; program returns copy if no anchor/keys, which is safe but misses non-anchor patterns.
 * extract_objects not present but implied via runs/keys—essential for identifying replicable blocks vs. static elements.
 * Subtle miss: In train1, expected has isolated 1's in rows 1,3,5 (cols 1,3) not replicated, showing only multi-row repeating runs are anchors; generated preserved them but erred on replication color.
 * Overall understanding: Core replication via keys/anchors grasped (passes 2/3 trains), but edge cases like multiple possible anchors or color-specific matching fail.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: It correctly detects bg=3; preserves existing patterns (e.g., row 0 all 3's, row 7 has isolated 8 at col1 untouched); replicates horizontal blocks like 1's/4's/2's in rows 1-4 and 10-13,17-20 using apparent stepping (e.g., 4-high blocks at cols ~13-16 and ~18-21, matching key-like sequences); extends to 4 blocks in some rows (e.g., row 17 adds 1's at end).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Row 5 has partial fills (1 at col1,4 at col3,1 at col5) that seem like over-placement or wrong extension (expected likely preserves isolated or non-repeating as-is, without filling bg between); rows 6-9 and 14-16 are mostly empty but generated fills row 5 oddly; third block in rows 17-20 is 4's where input has none, but adds extra 1's at cols 23-26 which may overrun or mismatch subsequence (input row 17 has 1's only in first two blocks); isolated 8 in row7 col1 is preserved but not replicated (correct, as non-run); overall, stepping seems asymmetric (down more filled than up), and no replication in upper/lower empties suggests missed anchors—likely wrong anchor picked (e.g., 4-high 1/4/2 seq from rows1-4 as anchor, but misextended for lower keys including the 8? which is excluded); differs from expected by adding unrequested blocks (e.g., extra 1's) and partial row5, indicating subsequence or diff calc error for longer keys.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors, with a dominant background color like 8 or 3), where vertical "tracks" carry signal patterns of colors, and horizontal blocks of uniform colors (at least 2 cells wide) form repeating or extrapolated patterns that must be anchored to a signal sequence and replicated vertically at positions derived from other signal rows, effectively completing or extending a patterned structure like a barcode or waveform visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most common cell value; all non-background placements must overwrite only background cells without disrupting existing non-background content.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals: isolated single non-background cells (consecutive non-bg must be exactly 1 per track for validity), excluding color 8 which may be special or ignored in signals.
 * Signals are extracted per row across valid tracks, collecting non-bg, non-8 colors; these form sequences per row, sorted by row index.
 * Horizontal blocks are runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in rows; these are candidates for uniform vertical rectangles (same color across height h rows).
 * Anchoring requires finding a vertical uniform block of height h (tried from size//2 down to 2) starting at row s, where the sequence of block colors (one per block range) is a subsequence of some signal row's colors; this anchors the pattern for replication.
 * Replication: For other signal rows i relative to anchor kk, calculate target start row target_s using steps like 2h-1 (downward) or 2h+1 (upward? code has asymmetry), ensuring target_s + h fits in grid; place colors as vertical blocks using extrapolated ranges (extending existing block starts by fixed width w and gaps like base_diff).
 * All blocks in a pattern must share the same width w (if not uniform, abort); new ranges are appended by adding w + gap from last, but capped at num colors and grid size.
 * Subsequence matching is loose (block colors must appear in order within signal colors, allowing extras); only place if color != bg and !=8.
 * Subtle: Anchor search starts from larger h downward, scans starting rows s; validity checks uniform color across the entire block rectangle and no out-of-bounds.
 * Easy to miss: Signals ignore 8 (possibly a separator or invalid); tracks require max_consec==1 (no stacked signals in column); placement skips if target out of bounds; code assumes sorted signal_data but places based on index delta.
 * In replication, delta >0 uses step=2h-1 (tight packing downward), delta<0 uses 2h+1 (looser upward?); base_diff from existing starts if multiple, else w+2.
 * Overwriting only bg cells during place; if existing non-bg, it stays (no overwrite).
 * Edge cases: No blocks or non-uniform w aborts to original grid; empty signals or no anchor returns original; size may vary (23x27 in ex2, 27x27 in test?).

(These handle range extrapolation and placement but have positioning bugs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct, successfully detected tracks, signals, uniform blocks, anchored correctly, and placed replications without overlap or shift issues.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated output places the 3,3 blocks (in rows 10-11,13-14) starting one column too left (e.g., columns 15-16 instead of 16-17), causing overlap or misalignment with the expected 8 separator; this repeats in all affected rows, while 1,1 blocks are correctly placed at columns 10-11,13-14.
 * Training example 3: Correct, handled whatever pattern (likely similar to 1) without the shift bug manifesting.
 * Overall, worked for detecting bg (8), tracks (odd cols with singles), signals (ignoring 8), block ranges, uniform anchor via subsequence, and step-based positioning (2h-1/2h+1); failed in range extrapolation/ placement for cases with multiple blocks per pattern, likely due to incorrect gap calculation in get_temp_ranges (uses w instead of w + gap for extensions, and base_diff only for second block).
 * is_subsequence is essential and correct for loose matching.
 * find_anchor is mostly correct but may pick suboptimal h/s if multiple candidates (tries largest h first, which is good).
 * get_temp_ranges is broken: for extensions beyond existing blocks, it adds only w (adjacent, no gap), but examples suggest gaps (e.g., +3 or +2 between starts); base_diff is used only for second, then switches to w, causing merged/ shifted blocks.
 * place is helpful but only overwrites bg, which is correct, but combined with bad ranges leads to wrong positions.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, though get_temp_ranges needs fix for gaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct; it appears to place patterns (e.g., long 1's in rows 1-5 columns ~13-26 matching some signal, 4's and 2's in rows 10-13 columns 13-17 and 18-21), but introduces anomalies like a single 8 in row 7 column 1 (which was likely in input but not overwritten or handled as signal, suggesting improper track/signal extraction or placement skipping).
 * In rows 17-20, it places 1's (columns 13-16), 4's (18-21), and extra 1's (23-26), but the right-side 1's (23-26) seem extrapolated incorrectly or with wrong gaps, as input has 1's only on left in similar rows; this may over-extend ranges without proper base_diff.
 * Top rows 0-6 have partial signals placed (1's and 4/2 in cols 1,3,5 matching input?), but row 3 has 4 in col 1 and 2 in col 5, while row 5 overwrites some; bottom is empty-ish except placed blocks, suggesting anchor found in upper part but replication downward missed some signals or miscalculated steps (e.g., no placement in rows 14-16 or 21+).
 * Compared to inferred expected (based on code logic and training): Likely should replicate upper signal patterns (1's,4,2 mixes) downward to match lower signals, with uniform blocks of w=4 for 1/4/2 groups separated by single 3's (gaps of 1 bg col); generated has correct widths but wrong starting columns/gaps (e.g., 1's in 23-26 shouldn't be there if input signals don't indicate extension that far), and the isolated 8 in row 7 indicates failure to treat 8 as non-signal or bg variant.
 * Does not make complete sense: Placements seem partially guided by signals but shifted/ overextended, similar to training 2 bug; misses potential upward replication or different step for this bg=3 case; extra 1's on right suggest broken get_temp_ranges appending without size check or wrong base_diff (input has 1's starting at col13, but extends to 26 without gap).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where an input grid with a background color, sparse signals in "tracks" (specific columns), and example "blocks" (rectangular uniform-color regions) must be extended by replicating and placing similar blocks for other signal patterns, anchored to a matching subsequence and shifted vertically by a calculated step, while preserving the background and avoiding overlaps or invalid placements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the color of any fully uniform row; assume it's the dominant color (e.g., 3 in the test output) and treat it as empty space—do not overwrite existing non-bg unless placing blocks.
 * Tracks are odd-indexed columns (starting from 1) that contain signals (non-bg cells), but only qualify if they have no consecutive non-bg cells (max_consec == 1), ensuring isolated signals rather than continuous lines.
 * Signal rows are any rows with at least one non-bg in a track; extract their non-bg colors in track order to form "signal colors" sequences (e.g., [1,4] for a row with 1 in track 1 and 4 in track 3).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start,end) ranges, assuming all blocks have the same width w, and height h = w for square blocks.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a vertical stack of h rows starting at s where the block ranges are uniformly filled with colors that form a subsequence matching one signal_colors[k]; this anchors the "template" block positions and the reference signal.
 * Placement for other signals: Shift anchor row s by delta_idx * step, where step is 2*h -1 for downward (positive delta) or 2*h +1 for upward (negative delta)—this spacing accounts for gaps between blocks (e.g., gap = space between anchor blocks).
 * Generate temporary ranges by extending existing block_ranges with repeated gaps if more blocks needed than anchors; place only on bg cells, clipping to grid size.
 * Subtleties: If no blocks or inconsistent widths, return copy of input (no change). Subsequence matching (is_subsequence) allows partial matches (e.g., [1,2] matches if signal has 1 then later 2, ignoring extras). Placement skips if out-of-bounds. Tracks must have signals but isolated. Easy to miss: uniform block check across h rows; gap calculation only if >=2 anchors; direction-specific steps create asymmetric spacing (tighter downward).
 * All considerations: Preserve input signals/tracks; only place in even columns or block areas; no overwriting non-bg; handle empty signals; size=grid dim (square assumed); validate ranges don't exceed size.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but code builds on modular functions for extraction/placement.
 * Worked: All 3 training examples correct, indicating solid handling of background detection, track isolation, signal extraction, block templating, anchor finding via subsequence, and shifted placement with gap/step logic for standard cases.
 * Did not work: Test output shows incomplete or misplaced blocks—e.g., rows 1-4 have partial 1's in columns 13-16 and 19-22 but inconsistent with signals; rows 10-13 have 4's (13-16) and 2's (19-22) stacked squarely but no extension beyond anchors; rows 17-20 mirror this but with 4's and 1's, suggesting anchor found but shifts/steps failed to place full sequences or handle multiple tracks properly (e.g., missing colors like 8 in row 7 not propagated). All-3 rows dominate (e.g., 0,5-9,14-16,21-26), indicating skipped placements due to out-of-bounds or no-match, but expected more filled blocks based on signals in input (inferred from output patterns).
 * Subtle issue: Step calculation (2h-1 down, 2h+1 up) may over/under-space for test grid size 27, causing clips; gap extension in get_temp_ranges assumes linear repeat but may not fit variable signal lengths.
 * extract_objects not present, but get_block_ranges serves similar role for identifying templates—helpful but assumes all blocks same width (fails if varied).
 * copy_grid is essential for non-destructive output.
 * is_subsequence is key but may be too permissive (allows non-consecutive matches, potentially wrong anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in code are relevant, though find_anchor's uniform check is strict and may miss partial anchors.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; while it preserves a bg=3 grid and shows stacked blocks (e.g., 4x4 squares of 4's/2's in rows 10-13 cols 13-16/19-22, and similar in 17-20 with 4's/1's), it appears incomplete—e.g., isolated signals like row 1's 1's and row 3's 4/2 not extended into full h-height blocks; row 7's 8 is isolated without replication; rows 1-4/17-20 have horizontal 1's but jagged/not uniform height, suggesting partial placement or failed uniformity. Expected: Fuller vertical stacks matching all signal_colors sequences, shifted from anchor (likely rows 10-13 as example), with colors like [1,1,1,1] or [4,2] propagated without overwriting, and no stray singles—current output has asymmetric/missing extensions (e.g., no upward placements above row 10), indicating step/gap or bound checks clipped valid spots. It makes partial sense (detected some tracks ~13,19; placed some squares) but differs from expected complete puzzle resolution by leaving signals unextended and blocks un-replicated across all deltas.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a dominant background color, a "key" sequence extracted from specific positions (likely on the left side), and a central "source block" pattern consisting of horizontal runs of non-background colors. The goal is to transform or replicate the source block multiple times (based on the key's length) in a specific direction (up or down from the source), applying colors from the key sequence to fill new instances of the block shape, while preserving the original grid where unfilled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most common color (e.g., 8 or 3 in examples); normalize it to 0 or similar for processing, and use a fixed color remapping (e.g., {1:2, 2:4, 3:1, 4:3, 8:0}) to standardize colors across grids before analysis.
 * Key extraction: Sample non-background cells from odd rows (e.g., rows 1,3,5,7,...) at specific columns (e.g., 1,3,5) to form a sequence of color lists; this key dictates the color transformations for replications (length of key minus one determines number of repetitions).
 * Source block detection: Look for consecutive rows in the horizontal center (roughly 25-75% of width) with matching horizontal runs of >=2 non-background cells; ignore edges and background; the block's height and run configurations (start column, width, color) must match across those rows.
 * Direction of replication: Determine if source is above or below grid center (e.g., average row position vs. (size-1)/2); replicate "down" (increasing rows) or "up" (decreasing rows) using a shift (e.g., size//4).
 * Filling replications: For each key step, place a copy of the source block's shape (using its run configs) at the target position, but replace colors with the corresponding key row's colors; only fill background cells, and clip if out of bounds; number of blocks per row may match source or expand based on key.
 * Special cases: If key rows have more elements than source blocks (is_special=True), adjust spacing/gaps between blocks (e.g., +2 or +3 rows between placements) and possibly reduce height for the first replication; treat special "up" as regular "up".
 * Subtleties: Replications may overlap or clip; preserve original source and any pre-existing non-background; inverse remap colors at the end; if no source found, just normalize and inverse without filling; horizontal center for source ignores outer quarters; runs must be contiguous and color-consistent per row.
 * Easy to miss: Key extraction skips background cells and may yield empty rows (but still count for repetitions); direction flips key indexing (e.g., key[0] for farthest up); gaps between replications vary (e.g., shift=size//4 for regular, fixed +2/+3 for special); block widths are fixed from source, but placements shift rightward if expanding blocks.
 * All attempts consider normalization as essential; failed cases often miss special spacing or key length handling; test grids may have larger sizes (e.g., 27x27), requiring scalable shifts.

(Fills a target level (row block) by replicating source shape with key colors; handles expansion to more blocks than source by shifting right with gaps; only overwrites bg.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it correctly handled Training 1 and 3, demonstrating understanding of normalization, key extraction, source detection, direction-based replication with shifts, and special cases for expanded keys.
 * Failed on Training 2: Generated output missed filling a 1-block (two 1's separated by 8) in rows 7-8 (middle section, columns ~10-15), where Expected has it; also, row 7 in Generated lacks the middle 1's entirely (shows only left 1's and a 3, but no central block), while Expected has central 1's in rows 7-8 and adjusts the 3's position; lower sections (rows 10-14) correctly placed 1's and 3's but may have minor spacing issues; upper rows (0-6) matched Expected perfectly, including scattered 1's/2's/3's.
 * Worked well for non-special cases (regular up/down replication) in Training 1/3, but special "down" case in Training 2 likely mishandled initial height reduction or gap spacing (e.g., used +3 but needed +2, or skipped a key row), leading to omitted central block.
 * extract_key is essential and worked (inferred from partial matches), but range limited to range(1,8,2) may miss longer keys in larger grids.
 * find_source_block is helpful and likely correct, as source placements in outputs align with centers.
 * fill_level is core and mostly works, but expansion logic (gaps = source_w -1, right-shift) failed to place extra blocks in Training 2's special case.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though the main program's direction/is_special logic needs refinement for varying gaps/heights in special down (e.g., h = source_h -1 for first, then full; t_start = prev_end +3 for first, +2 after).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It preserved upper scattered elements (e.g., 1/4/2/8 in rows 1,3,5,7) correctly as originals, detected a source block around rows 10-13 (4's left, 2's right in center), and replicated downwards with key colors (e.g., rows 16-18 use 4's and 2's but shifted right; rows 20-23 use 1's left/middle/right with 4's; rows 25-26 fill 8's), which aligns with down-direction replication and key sequence (inferred key like [1,4,2] or similar from left positions).
 * However, it likely missed or incorrectly handled special expansion/spacing: Rows 16-18 have 4's block followed by 2's but narrower/shifted (only 3 2's vs. expected 4?), and rows 20-23 expand to three blocks (1's, 4's, 1's) but with uneven widths/gaps (e.g., 4 1's left, 3 4's middle, 3 1's right; possible clipping or wrong gap=source_w-1); lower 8's seem like a final key step but only 2 rows high vs. source's 4, suggesting height adjustment error; no upward fills despite possible center check; upper row 7 has a lone 8 which might be unfilled bg but could need preservation check; overall, replications are present but misaligned in width/position compared to source (source has 4-wide blocks, but some targets narrower), indicating fill_level's expansion or clipping is buggy for larger size=27 (shift=6? may cause overlaps/misses).
 * To handle test: Extend key extraction range (e.g., to size//3 or dynamic); adjust special down gaps to +2/+3 conditionally; ensure block widths stay source_w even in expansion; verify bg_norm=0 for 3; test output shows core replication but subtle positioning errors, so not fully correct—likely would fail if Expected demands exact source widths and tighter gaps.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid represents a pattern with a background color, vertical "tracks" (likely odd-indexed columns) containing isolated signal colors, and horizontal "blocks" (consecutive cells of the same non-background color, at least 2 wide) that need to be detected, anchored, and extended or placed vertically to match subsequences of signal colors across multiple rows. The goal is to generate an output grid that completes or replicates these block patterns at relative positions based on an anchor point, filling only background areas without overwriting existing non-background cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is typically the most common or uniform row color (e.g., 3), but must be reliably detected even if not all rows are uniform.
 * Tracks are specifically odd-indexed columns (j in range(1, size, 2)) that contain at least one non-background cell, but only qualify if all non-background cells are isolated (max consecutive == 1), indicating "signals" rather than blocks.
 * Signal rows are those with any non-background in tracks; signal colors are the list of non-background values in those tracks per row, in track order.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of the same non-background color (>=2 wide) across any row; all detected blocks must have uniform width (h) for anchoring to work, otherwise fall back to default placement.
 * Anchoring requires finding a starting row s where a vertical stack of h rows has uniform horizontal blocks matching the positions/sizes in block_ranges, and their colors form a subsequence of one signal_colors list (using is_subsequence check); this anchor_k identifies which signal to "root" placements to.
 * Placements extend blocks forward/backward from anchor using steps (e.g., 2*h -1 or 2*h +1) and differences from existing ranges; only fill background cells, and limit to grid bounds.
 * If no blocks or no anchor found, default to h=2, centered horizontal placements with fixed spacing (diff_start=2*h+1, vertical step=2*h+1), starting from grid center.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows partial matches (e.g., block colors can be a subset of signal colors in order); placements can overlap or extend partial blocks but shouldn't overwrite non-bg; vertical positioning uses delta * step, with forward/backward steps differing to avoid overlap; isolated signals (max_consec=1) distinguish tracks from potential vertical blocks.
 * Edge cases: Empty signals return input unchanged; non-uniform block widths or invalid anchors trigger default mode; bounds checking prevents out-of-grid placements; multiple signals per row possible, but colors list per signal_row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Ensure block detection scans all rows but deduplicates ranges by position; vertical uniformity check in anchor must verify entire block rectangle is same color; default mode assumes symmetric centering but may not fit odd-sized grids perfectly.

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    size = len(g)
    if size == 0:
        return 0
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:

    return g[0][0]
```
(This reliably detects uniform background rows or defaults to top-left; useful for grids with mixed rows.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):
        has_signal = False
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:

```
(Key for identifying signal tracks; enforces isolation to avoid mistaking vertical blocks for signals.)

```python

    i = 0

            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Essential for matching block color sequences to signal colors; allows skipping in b for partial fits.)

(Extracts unique horizontal block positions/sizes; deduplicates to find consistent patterns across rows.)

```python
def find_anchor(g: List[List[int]], block_ranges: List[Tuple[int, int]], h: int, signal_colors: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    # (Full function body as in program; checks vertical uniformity and subsequence match)
```
(Core for locating anchor; verifies full rectangular uniformity, which is subtle and easy to miss.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * extend_ranges and place_blocks: These are implementation helpers but can over-extend beyond grid or place on non-bg if not careful (e.g., no overwrite check in place_blocks beyond bg==3); they're functional but brittle for varying sizes.
 * The default placement logic in program (when no blocks/anchor): Assumes fixed h=2 and centering, which works for training but may not generalize to test if input expects different h or asymmetry; it's a fallback but overrides custom block detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully passed all three training examples, indicating core understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchoring/placement logic.
 * Worked well: Uniform background detection, isolated signal filtering in tracks, subsequence matching for anchors, and relative placement with steps (forward/backward differentiation avoids overlap in training).
 * Did not work/partial issues: In default mode (no blocks), fixed spacing (e.g., diff_start=2*h+1) may not align with input patterns if test has asymmetric or wider defaults; anchor search assumes blocks exist in exact range positions vertically, which could miss partial or shifted anchors.
 * Block width uniformity check is strict (len(widths)!=1 returns copy), which is good for consistency but may fail tests with mixed widths (fallback to default helps but isn't adaptive).
 * No explicit handling for multiple block sets per row or vertical signals misidentified as tracks (but max_consec=1 prevents most).
 * Training successes suggest extract-like functions (get_tracks, get_signal_colors, get_block_ranges) are essential for decomposing the grid into signals vs. blocks.
 * No prior attempts to compare, but this attempt demonstrates progressive logic (detect -> extract -> anchor -> place), which is helpful for future refinements.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (27x27 grid, bg=3) shows partial placements: e.g., row 1 has isolated 1's in positions ~1,3,5 (possibly misplaced signals) and a block of four 1's starting ~13, then another at ~18-21 and ~23-26; row 3 has similar but with 4's and a 2; rows 10-13 have vertical stacks of four 4's (~13-16) and four 2's (~18-21,23-26); rows 17-20 mirror with 1's and four 4's.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely complete symmetric horizontal blocks across full h-height vertical stacks matching all signal_colors subsequences, but here placements are inconsistent—e.g., row 1 has singles (not blocks >=2), row 2/4/5 are mostly bg with trailing 1's (partial fills?), and upper rows (0,6-9) are all bg (possibly no signals there). Lower blocks (rows 10-13,17-20) look like proper 4-high stacks, but spacing/diffs seem off (e.g., 4's and 2's blocks are adjacent without expected gaps like 2*h+1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input had partial anchors or signals in odd columns, output should extend uniformly without isolated cells (e.g., row1 singles suggest failed block placement or track misdetection); vertical stacks are present but may not match all signal rows (e.g., no clear anchor in upper half); many rows remain all-bg, indicating skipped placements due to bounds or delta*step overflow (size=27, steps~5 for h=2 could skip). Unknown why upper signals (1,4,2) didn't form full blocks—possibly anchor not found, triggering partial default.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense (some block completions) but appears incomplete/inaccurate, missing full pattern replication (e.g., no forward/backward extensions from a clear anchor; irregularities like non-uniform heights).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or signals on a background, where the task is to detect sparse "signals" in vertical tracks and use them to identify and extend uniform colored block patterns across the grid, anchoring from an existing block structure and propagating it to match signal sequences in other rows. The goal is to fill in missing blocks while preserving existing content and ensuring blocks are uniform rectangles that align with signal colors as subsequences.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the dominant color, often 3 in examples; all uniform rows help confirm it, but fall back to top-left if no full uniform row.
 * Tracks are vertical columns (specifically odd-indexed, starting from 1) that contain signals—defined as having at least one non-bg cell, but crucially only those where non-bg cells are isolated (max consecutive non-bg == 1, no clumps).
 * Signals are rows with non-bg cells in tracks; collect unique such rows, sort them, and extract non-bg colors from tracks in those rows (excluding 8, which may be a special/noise value).
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of 2+ consecutive identical non-bg cells in any row; collect unique (start, end) ranges across the grid.
 * Anchor detection: Search for a rectangular block structure (height h >=2, starting at row s) where blocks are uniform color across height, all blocks same width w, positions match a sorted list of block ranges, and the sequence of block colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors.
 * Extension: Once anchored, propagate to other signal rows by calculating row positions with forward/backward steps (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward), extending block ranges rightward if needed (with fixed gap between blocks), and placing only on bg cells.
 * Fallback if no anchor: Use default h=2, w=2, start blocks at center, step backward from bottom, extend ranges, place blocks— but this seems less precise and may overlap or misalign.
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows signals to have extra colors not in blocks (e.g., blocks match a subset); only place on bg to avoid overwriting; ensure extended ranges don't exceed grid size; gap between blocks is derived from anchor (end1 +1 + gap = start2); signals may have varying numbers of colors, so extend blocks to match; isolated signals (max_consec=1) define tracks, but blocks can be wider; 8 is ignored in signal colors, possibly a delimiter or invalid.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no signals returns copy; anchor search starts from larger h downward, left-to-right s; if multiple anchors possible, takes first found; propagation skips invalid positions (out of bounds); in fallback, starts from bottom and steps up (negative direction).
 * All existing non-bg must be preserved unless overwritten logically, but code only overwrites bg; block colors must exactly match signal colors in order.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of track detection, signal extraction, block ranging, and anchor-based propagation.
 * Anchor finding with subsequence matching worked well for trainings, allowing flexible pattern extension without requiring exact sequence matches.
 * Fallback logic (default blocks from bottom) was not triggered in trainings (since anchors found), but ensures something is placed if no anchor.
 * get_tracks enforces isolated signals (max_consec=1), which is crucial and worked; without it, clumped columns might be misidentified.
 * place_blocks only overwrites bg, preserving existing non-bg, which is correct and prevented overwriting in trainings.
 * extend_block_ranges correctly adds blocks rightward with fixed gap and width, handling varying signal lengths.
 * No major misses in trainings, but search for anchor starts from larger h downward and left s, which may prefer certain patterns; step calculations (2h-1 forward, 2h+1 backward) seem empirically tuned for spacing between signal rows.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows placements in rows 10-13 (4-wide blocks of 4 at cols 13-16, 2 at 18-21), rows 17-20 (4-wide 1 at 13-16, 4 at 18-21, 1 at 23-26), and scattered signals in upper rows (e.g., row1: 1s at cols1,3,13-16,18-21,23-26; row3 similar), with some existing patterns like row3 cols13-16=1s preserved/modified minimally.
 * It looks partially correct: blocks are uniform rectangles matching apparent signal colors (e.g., 4s and 2s in lower, 1s and 4s in mid-lower), placed on bg=3 without overwriting, and aligned to even-ish columns suggesting track influence; spacing/gaps seem consistent (e.g., gap=1 between block groups).
 * However, upper signals (rows 1-5) have placements like isolated 1/4/2 in even cols (0,2,5?), but code targets odd tracks— this may be existing input not extended, or fallback/misplacement; row6 has 1/4/1 but no block extension visible, suggesting propagation skipped invalid positions.
 * Lower blocks (rows10-13,17-20) match multi-color signals (e.g., [4,2] subsequence for row10+), but row14-16 are all bg—no placement, possibly no matching signal or out-of-bounds; overall, it makes sense as an extension but may miss forward propagation from anchor (if anchor in upper/mid) or undetect some tracks (e.g., col5 has signals but no blocks there).
 * Existing input has vertical alignments (e.g., cols13-16 have 1s in rows2-5, then 4s lower), and output extends horizontally into blocks, which aligns with rules; no obvious errors like overwriting non-bg or mismatched colors, but subtle issue: signal rows include row7? (all bg, skipped correctly), and 8 in row7 col1 ignored properly.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 10:58:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving a background color (most common cell value) and sparse "signals" in specific vertical tracks (odd-indexed columns with isolated non-background cells), where the goal is to identify and extend horizontal block patterns (uniform color runs of width >=2) vertically and horizontally across the grid to match or complete patterns suggested by sequences of signal colors in those tracks, using an "anchor" block as a reference for positioning others via calculated steps and gaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is the most frequent color in the grid; all non-bg cells are potential signals or blocks, but 8 is treated as a special non-color (ignored in signal extraction).
 * Tracks are strictly odd columns (1-based indexing, so j=1,3,5,...) that must have signals (non-bg cells) but only as isolated singles (max consecutive non-bg ==1 per column); no tracks if this fails.
 * Signal rows are any row with at least one non-bg in a track; signal colors per row are the non-bg, non-8 values from tracks, in column order—used as sequences to match against block color orders.
 * Blocks are horizontal runs of the same non-bg color, length >=2, collected across all rows as (start_col, end_col) tuples; all blocks must share exactly one uniform width (w), or no extension happens.
 * Anchor finding: Search for a rectangular region of height h (tried from max_h down to 2) starting at row s, where multiple block ranges form a uniform-color stack (same color per column range across h rows), and the sequence of those colors is a subsequence of one signal row's colors (index kk); this anchors the pattern.
 * Positioning extensions: For other signal rows (i != kk), compute delta = i - kk; step is 2*h -1 for positive delta (downward), 2*h +1 for negative (upward? but code uses same logic—potential bug); target_s = s + delta * step, skip if out of bounds.
 * Gap between blocks: Inferred from existing block starts (starts[1] - starts[0] - w), assumed constant; extend ranges by appending new ones with gap + w until num_needed = len(signal_colors[i]) or grid edge.
 * Placement: Overwrite only bg cells in the target rectangle with the signal colors (skipping bg or 8), using extended ranges; no overwriting existing non-bg (only if out[r][cc] == bg).
 * Subtleties: Subsequence matching allows non-consecutive matches (e.g., block colors can skip some signal colors); max_h = min(size//2, 10) limits search; uniform check in anchor requires exact color match across h rows and full block widths; if no anchor or mismatched widths, return original grid unchanged; assumes square grid (size x size); potential issues with even/odd steps not aligning perfectly, or gaps varying per signal row (code assumes global gap).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid/signal_colors/blocks return original; blocks can span any columns (not just tracks); signals can have duplicates or skips; 8 acts as bg for signals but may be a foreground in blocks (code doesn't skip 8 in blocks).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter

def get_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    flat = [cell for row in g for cell in row]
    if not flat:
        return 0
    return Counter(flat).most_common(1)[0][0]
```
(Reliable for identifying bg as mode.)

```python
def get_tracks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    tracks = []
    for j in range(1, size, 2):
        has_signal = any(g[i][j] != bg for i in range(size))
        max_consec = 0
        consec = 0
        for i in range(size):
            if g[i][j] != bg:
                consec += 1
                max_consec = max(max_consec, consec)
            else:
                consec = 0
        if has_signal and max_consec == 1:
            tracks.append(j)
    return tracks
```
(Accurately identifies valid signal tracks with isolated non-bg cells.)

```python
def get_signal_rows(g: List[List[int]], tracks: List[int], bg: int, size: int) -> List[int]:
    signal_set = set()
    for r in range(size):
        if any(g[r][c] != bg for c in tracks):
            signal_set.add(r)
    return sorted(signal_set)

def get_signal_colors(g: List[List[int]], signal_rows: List[int], tracks: List[int], bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    colors = []
    for r in signal_rows:
        row_colors = [g[r][c] for c in tracks if g[r][c] != bg and g[r][c] != 8]
        colors.append(row_colors)
    return colors
```
(Extracts signal positions and color sequences, excluding 8; useful for pattern matching.)

```python
def get_block_ranges(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, size: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    ranges_set = set()
    for i in range(size):
        j = 0
        while j < size:
            if g[i][j] == bg:
                j += 1
                continue
            start = j
            c = g[i][j]
            while j < size and g[i][j] == c:
                j += 1
            end = j - 1
            if end - start + 1 >= 2:
                ranges_set.add((start, end))
            j += 1
    return sorted(ranges_set)
```
(Collects all horizontal block positions; dedupes via set, sorts by start; essential for identifying base patterns.)

```python
def is_subsequence(a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> bool:
    if not a:
        return True
    i = 0
    for val in b:
        if i < len(a) and val == a[i]:
            i += 1
            if i == len(a):
                return True
    return i == len(a)
```
(Standard subsequence check; key for matching block colors to signals without requiring exact order match.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; no prior iterations to summarize misses.
 * Training examples 1-3 all passed (correct outputs), indicating core logic works for simpler cases with clear anchors, uniform widths, and aligned steps/gaps.
 * Test case: Program ran successfully but output shows partial placements—e.g., rows 1-5 and 17-20 have scattered 1s,4s,2s in columns ~13-26, rows 10-13 have 4s and 2s in ~13-22, but many areas remain all-bg (3), and no placements in upper/lower rows (e.g., rows 0,6-9,14-16,21-26 mostly untouched beyond original); this suggests anchor was found (likely in lower blocks), but extensions failed for some deltas (out of bounds or mismatched num_needed), or step/gap misaligned for test complexity.
 * Worked: Background detection (3), track extraction (odd cols with singles, e.g., cols 1,3,5 visible in output signals), signal colors (1,4,2 patterns match placed blocks), block ranges (widths like 4 for 1s/4s/2s), anchor matching (subsequence allowed partial fits), and placement only on bg without overwrite.
 * Didn't work: No extensions in multiple signal positions (e.g., upper signals in rows ~1-5 not fully propagated downward or vice versa); gap computation assumes sorted starts from all blocks but may use wrong subset (global vs. per-anchor); step (2h±1) may not match puzzle's vertical spacing (perhaps fixed step like 2h or h+1); uniform anchor check too strict (requires full h rows uniform, but test may have partial overlaps); widths unified globally but test has mixed (1s width=4, but scattered 1s in output are not always >=2 consecutive—placement bug?); potential index off-by-one in tracks (0-based vs 1-based odd cols).
 * Function `find_anchor` is helpful but slow/strict (tries large h first, nested loops, breaks on any non-uniform; may miss if blocks don't align perfectly to signal subsequence).
 * Function `compute_gap` assumes at least 2 blocks and fixed diff, but test may have variable gaps or single-block anchors (falls back to 1, leading to tight packing).
 * Function `extend_block_ranges` appends rightward only, but test may need leftward or bidirectional extensions.
 * Function `place_blocks` skips c==8/bg correctly, but in test, some placed areas have isolated 1s (not >=2 wide), violating block rule—suggests placement doesn't enforce min width post-extend.
 * Overall, core extraction (bg, tracks, signals, blocks) works; failures in positioning/extension for complex test (multiple signal sets, larger size=27?).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It preserves original bg (3) everywhere, adds block-like fills (e.g., rows 10-13: cols 13-16=4, 18-21=2; rows 17-20: cols 13-16=1, 18-21=4, 23-26=1), and isolated signals (e.g., row1 col1=1, row3 col1=4/col5=2), suggesting anchor found in lower blocks (rows~10-13) matching a signal subsequence (e.g., [4,2]), with downward extension to rows~17-20 using step~7 (if h=4, 2*4-1=7, 10+7=17). Tracks seem correct (odd cols have singles like col1=1/4, col3=1/4, col5=2/1? but output shows patterns).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Upper signals (rows~1-5 with 1,4,2 in odd cols) are not extended (no blocks placed around them, e.g., no horizontal fills near row1 signals); scattered singles (e.g., row1 cols13-26 not blocked, just isolated 1s) instead of solid blocks >=2 wide; no upward extensions from anchor (if delta<0); many rows (0,6-9,14-16,21-26) unchanged, suggesting skipped deltas or out-of-bounds; gap seems ~1 (blocks at 13-16,18-21,23-26= gap1 between), but may not match test's intended spacing; overall, incomplete pattern completion—expected full grid with symmetric or chained block stacks across all signal rows, but output has only 2-3 stack levels instead of 4+.
