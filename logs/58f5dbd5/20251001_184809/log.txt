=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 18:48:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 18:56:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection of 5x5 "blocks" or pixel-art representations of digits (specifically 1,2,3,4,6,8,9) embedded in a larger grid, where the blocks are solid regions of a single non-background number surrounded by background (0 or other uniform value). The goal is to extract these blocks, group them logically (e.g., by approximate rows), sort them, and re-render them in a new bordered grid using predefined 5x5 patterns for each digit, separated by spacing and borders, effectively "decoding" or reformatting the input grid into a clean display of the digits.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color/value, with no internal variations or extensions beyond 5x5; the detection scans the grid row-by-row and column-by-column, skipping background (bg) areas.
 * Grouping logic assumes vertical proximity: blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units (to handle adjacency without overlap), then sorted by starting row for groups and by starting column within groups; this handles multi-row arrangements but may fail if blocks overlap or are diagonally placed.
 * Output grid uses the input's background value (bg) for borders and spacers: full border rows/columns of bg, 5-unit spacing between blocks in a group (6 units total per block including gap), and 1-unit vertical spacers between groups (leading to height = 6 * num_groups + 1, but code has a bug in current_row +=5 then +1 only if not last).
 * Patterns are hardcoded 5x5 matrices for digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9, where the digit value fills "on" pixels and 0 is transparent (replaced by bg in output); missing patterns for 0,5,7 mean unsupported digits are skipped.
 * Subtlety: Patterns must exactly match expected digit shapes, which appear to be stylized (e.g., like LCD/segment displays in 5x5); mismatches in "on" pixel positions cause incorrect outputs, as seen in training examples.
 * Input grids have uniform bg (e.g., 8 in train1, 1 in train3, 3 in test), and blocks don't overlap; empty input returns single bg cell.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering overlays patterns starting at offsets (row 1, col 1 for first, +6 per block), but only if the block's color matches a pattern key; vertical spacing adds extra bg row between groups, but code's current_row logic skips the final spacer correctly only if adjusted.
 * Detection assumes rectangular grid with n rows, m cols; no handling for irregular shapes or non-integer blocks.
 * Output preserves digit values but embeds them in bg-bordered cells, with no rotation, scaling, or color changes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes a main `program` function that handles detection, grouping, and rendering; no separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the block detection loop is useful as a core extractor. Below is an extracted/adapted version of the helpful block detection part (the rest of the program has pattern bugs):

```python
import typing as tp

def extract_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if g[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

The grouping and rendering parts in the original are partially helpful but buggy (e.g., pattern mismatches, spacing). No types beyond List[List[int]] are used. The `patterns` dict is essential but currently incorrect for some digits (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (previous submission); it correctly detects 5x5 blocks and groups them by row proximity/sorting, which works for basic extraction and placement in train2 (full match).
 * Block detection loop successfully identifies solid regions and skips bg, handling empty grids; this is core and reusable.
 * Grouping by row (sort by start_row, merge if <=5 apart) and within-group col sort works for vertical/horizontal arrangements, as in train3 where two blocks per "row" are placed side-by-side.
 * Rendering creates correct overall structure: bg borders, 6-unit wide slots per block, vertical spacers; train2 passed fully, showing core layout logic is sound for some cases.
 * Patterns dict is unhelpful/inaccurate: for digit 1, generated has incorrect "on" positions (e.g., row2: 1 at col2,8s elsewhere vs. expected more centered/top-heavy); for 6, row4 has 6 at col2,8,9-11 vs. expected; for 4 in train1/3, mismatches like row3 all 8s in center vs. expected partial 4s; for 3 in train3, row2/3 have wrong 3 placements (e.g., row3: 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,3,1,3? wait, expected has variations); for 9 similar issues in row3/4. These cause train1 and train3 to fail despite correct positions.
 * Sorting works (blocks by row then col), but assumes no overlaps/duplicates; didn't handle pattern transparency correctly (0s become bg, but positions wrong).
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the full `program` is broken due to pattern errors; the `extract_blocks` adaptation above is helpful and should be kept, while patterns need full rewrite from expected outputs.
 * Train1 mismatches: 1's pattern has extra 1s in wrong spots (e.g., row3 col3=1 vs. expected 8?); 6's row2/4 off; 4's row2/3/4/5 have misplaced 4s (e.g., row5 all 4s bottom vs. expected partial).
 * Train3 mismatches: 8/4 placement correct but patterns slightly off (minor for 8/4? but 4 in row3/4 wrong); 3's row2=3,1,3,1,3? generated has 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,1,1,3 (wait, similar but row3 generated 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,3,1,3,3; row4 similar); 9's row2 generated 9,1,9,1,9 vs. expected 9,1,9,1,9 (match?) but row3 9,1,1,9,9 vs. expected 9,1,1,9,9 (match) wait, actual diffs in row3/4 for 3/9 as noted.
 * Overall, detection/grouping solid (6/10 on that), rendering patterns fail (0/10), leading to partial success.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it detects and places two blocks per group (4 and 8 in row-group1, 2 and 1 in group2, 6 and 9 in group3), with bg=3 borders/spacers, correct 13-col width (6*2 +1 per group) and ~19-row height (6*3 +1, but with internal 5+1=6 per group); layout positions blocks at expected offsets (e.g., first group rows 1-5 cols1-5 for 4, 7-11 for 8).
 * However, it does not look fully correct due to pattern mismatches similar to training: for 4 (top-left), row3 has 4,3,3,3,4,4? wait generated row3: [3,4,3,3,3,4,3,...] which seems off vs. likely expected more structured (from train1's 4 pattern); for 8, row3/4 have 8,3,3,8,8 which may match a partial but row5 all 8s bottom ok?; for 2 (group2 left), row3:2,3,3,2,2 ok? but row4:2,3,2,3,2 vs. expected from patterns likely 2,0,2,0,2 filled; for 1 right of it, row4:1,3,3,3,1 wrong (overly sparse); for 6/9 in group3, similar issues (e.g., 6 row4:6,3,6,6,6 vs. expected from train1 6,8,6,6,6 filled). It extracts correctly but renders wrong shapes, so output is structurally right but visually distorted digits; to fix, derive exact patterns from all expected outputs (e.g., aggregate train1/3 diffs to correct dict). Unknown why some positions flip 3/bg, but likely pattern 0 placements.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 18:56:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection of 5x5 "blocks" or pixel-art representations of digits (specifically 1,2,3,4,6,8,9) embedded in a larger grid, where the blocks are solid regions of a single non-background number surrounded by background (0 or other uniform value). The goal is to extract these blocks, group them logically (e.g., by approximate rows), sort them, and re-render them in a new bordered grid using predefined 5x5 patterns for each digit, separated by spacing and borders, effectively "decoding" or reformatting the input grid into a clean display of the digits.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color/value, with no internal variations or extensions beyond 5x5; the detection scans the grid row-by-row and column-by-column, skipping background (bg) areas.
 * Grouping logic assumes vertical proximity: blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units (to handle adjacency without overlap), then sorted by starting row for groups and by starting column within groups; this handles multi-row arrangements but may fail if blocks overlap or are diagonally placed.
 * Output grid uses the input's background value (bg) for borders and spacers: full border rows/columns of bg, 5-unit spacing between blocks in a group (6 units total per block including gap), and 1-unit vertical spacers between groups (leading to height = 6 * num_groups + 1, but code has a bug in current_row +=5 then +1 only if not last).
 * Patterns are hardcoded 5x5 matrices for digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9, where the digit value fills "on" pixels and 0 is transparent (replaced by bg in output); missing patterns for 0,5,7 mean unsupported digits are skipped.
 * Subtlety: Patterns must exactly match expected digit shapes, which appear to be stylized (e.g., like LCD/segment displays in 5x5); mismatches in "on" pixel positions cause incorrect outputs, as seen in training examples.
 * Input grids have uniform bg (e.g., 8 in train1, 1 in train3, 3 in test), and blocks don't overlap; empty input returns single bg cell.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering overlays patterns starting at offsets (row 1, col 1 for first, +6 per block), but only if the block's color matches a pattern key; vertical spacing adds extra bg row between groups, but code's current_row logic skips the final spacer correctly only if adjusted.
 * Detection assumes rectangular grid with n rows, m cols; no handling for irregular shapes or non-integer blocks.
 * Output preserves digit values but embeds them in bg-bordered cells, with no rotation, scaling, or color changes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes a main `program` function that handles detection, grouping, and rendering; no separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the block detection loop is useful as a core extractor. Below is an extracted/adapted version of the helpful block detection part (the rest of the program has pattern bugs):

```python
import typing as tp

def extract_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if g[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

The grouping and rendering parts in the original are partially helpful but buggy (e.g., pattern mismatches, spacing). No types beyond List[List[int]] are used. The `patterns` dict is essential but currently incorrect for some digits (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (previous submission); it correctly detects 5x5 blocks and groups them by row proximity/sorting, which works for basic extraction and placement in train2 (full match).

These cause train1 and train3 to fail despite correct positions.

 * Train3 mismatches: 8/4 placement correct but patterns slightly off (minor for 8/4? but 4 in row3/4 wrong); 3's row2=3,1,3,1,3? generated has 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,1,1,3 (wait, similar but row3 generated 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,3,1,3,3; row4 similar); 9's row2 generated 9,1,9,1,9 vs. expected 9,1,9,1,9 (match?) but row3 9,1,1,9,9 vs. expected 9,1,1,9,9 (match) wait, actual diffs in row3/4 for 3/9 as noted.
 * Overall, detection/grouping solid (6/10 on that), rendering patterns fail (0/10), leading to partial success.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it detects and places two blocks per group (4 and 8 in row-group1, 2 and 1 in group2, 6 and 9 in group3), with bg=3 borders/spacers, correct 13-col width (6*2 +1 per group) and ~19-row height (6*3 +1, but with internal 5+1=6 per group); layout positions blocks at expected offsets (e.g., first group rows 1-5 cols1-5 for 4, 7-11 for 8).
 * However, it does not look fully correct due to pattern mismatches similar to training: for 4 (top-left), row3 has 4,3,3,3,4,4? wait generated row3: [3,4,3,3,3,4,3,...] which seems off vs. likely expected more structured (from train1's 4 pattern); for 8, row3/4 have 8,3,3,8,8 which may match a partial but row5 all 8s bottom ok?; for 2 (group2 left), row3:2,3,3,2,2 ok? but row4:2,3,2,3,2 vs. expected from patterns likely 2,0,2,0,2 filled; for 1 right of it, row4:1,3,3,3,1 wrong (overly sparse); for 6/9 in group3, similar issues (e.g., 6 row4:6,3,6,6,6 vs. expected from train1 6,8,6,6,6 filled). It extracts correctly but renders wrong shapes, so output is structurally right but visually distorted digits; to fix, derive exact patterns from all expected outputs (e.g., aggregate train1/3 diffs to correct dict). Unknown why some positions flip 3/bg, but likely pattern 0 placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:04:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background color, with the color value representing a specific digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), arranged in horizontal rows separated vertically by background space. The goal is to detect these blocks, group them by row, and render each as a predefined 5x5 binary pattern (1s as the digit's color, 0s as background) in a new output grid with background-filled borders and single-cell background separators between digits horizontally and full background rows between digit rows vertically.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input blocks are exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color; no partial or non-solid blocks should be extracted, and background is taken from top-left cell (often 0,1,3,4,8 in examples).
 * Digits supported are only 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 (no 0,5,7); if a color doesn't match, it should likely be skipped or treated as invalid, but all examples use valid colors.
 * Grouping blocks into rows: blocks in the same row have starting rows close enough (code uses <= last +5, which works for examples where rows are separated by exactly 1 bg row, but may need tightening if overlaps occur; sort by row then col).
 * Output structure: single top/bottom bg row, then for each group: 5 pattern rows + 1 full bg separator row (except after last group); horizontally, patterns start at col 1, spaced every 6 cols (5 pattern +1 bg separator), with left/right bg borders.
 * Patterns must be exactly binary 5x5 (1=on/pixel with digit color, 0=off/bg); the provided patterns are incorrect for several digits (e.g., 1,3), leading to mismatches—must reverse-engineer from expected outputs.
 * Subtle: Patterns are not symmetric or standard 7-segment; e.g., digit 1 is a thin vertical with serifs but wider base (row2/4: positions 1 and 5 on, 2-4 off; row3: 1-2 and 4-5 on), not the code's version. Digit 3 has a top bar, middle connections, but code's row2 is wrong (expected 1 0 0 0 1, not 1 0 1 0 1). No overlapping blocks or diagonal arrangements in examples. Background never appears inside blocks. Output dimensions must account for max blocks per row.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering uses the block's color for '1's in pattern, not a fixed color; separators are single bg cells/rows, not thicker. If no blocks, output minimal bg grid. All examples have even spacing, but test may vary row separation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful for extraction and rendering structure, but patterns need fixing:

```python
def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extract the background color from the top-left cell."""
    return grid[0][0] if grid and grid[0] else 0
```

```python
def extract_solid_5x5_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples.
    A solid block is a 5x5 region where all cells are the same non-background color."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    bg = get_background(grid)
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0]) if grid[0] else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if grid[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

```python
def group_into_rows(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Groups blocks into rows based on starting row proximity (within 5 units).
    Sorts groups by starting row and blocks within groups by starting column."""
    if not blocks:
        return []
    # Sort by starting row, then column
    sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b[0], b[1]))
    groups = []
    current_group = [sorted_blocks[0]]
    for block in sorted_blocks[1:]:
        if block[0] <= current_group[-1][0] + 5:
            current_group.append(block)
        else:
            # Sort current group by column
            current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = [block]
    # Sort last group by column
    current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
    groups.append(current_group)
    return groups
```

```python
def compute_output_dimensions(groups: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Computes the height and width of the output grid based on number of groups and max blocks per group."""
    if not groups:

    num_groups = len(groups)
    max_blocks_per_row = max(len(group) for group in groups)
    height = 6 * num_groups + 1
    width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1
    return height, width
```

```python
def initialize_output_grid(height: int, width: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Initializes the output grid filled with background color."""
    return [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
```

```python
def render_digit_pattern(pattern: List[List[int]], color: int, bg: int, start_row: int, start_col: int, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """Renders a 5x5 digit pattern into the grid at the given position, using color for 1s and bg for 0s."""
    for k in range(5):
        for l in range(5):
            val = color if pattern[k][l] == 1 else bg
            grid[start_row + k][start_col + l] = val
```

The `get_digit_patterns` function is helpful in structure but broken due to incorrect patterns (do not reuse as-is; must update to match expected shapes from training outputs, e.g., for 1: row1 all1, row2 [1,0,0,0,1], row3 [1,1,0,1,1], row4 [1,0,0,0,1], row5 all1; similar fixes for 3 and others).

The main `program` function integrates these well but fails due to patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single previous attempt provided; it correctly extracts solid 5x5 blocks using color as digit identifier and groups them into rows based on vertical proximity, producing correct overall structure (spacing, borders, number of digits/rows).
 * What worked: Block detection accurately identifies all solid 5x5 regions (e.g., in train1 detects three single-digit rows for 1/6/4; train2 one row with 1/2/3; train3 two rows with 8+4 and 3+9); grouping correctly clusters horizontal rows without merging across separators; output dimensions and rendering placement (with bg separators) match expected layout exactly, including borders and no extra space.
 * What didn't work: Digit patterns are incorrect, causing shape mismatches in all training examples (e.g., train1 digit1 row2 generated 1 8 8 1 1 vs expected 1 8 8 8 1; row3 generated 1 1 8 1 1 vs expected 1 1 8 1 1—wait, row3 matches by coincidence but overall wrong; train2 digit1 row4 generated 1 4 4 1 1 vs expected 1 4 4 4 1; digit3 row2 generated 3 4 3 4 3 vs expected 3 4 3 4 3—wait, some partial matches but train2 row4 for1 wrong; train3 digit3 row9 (k=1) generated 3 1 3 1 3 vs expected 3 1 1 1 3; row10 (k=2) generated 3 1 1 1 3 vs expected 3 3 1 3 3; digit8 row4 generated 8 1 1 8 8 vs expected 8 8 8 1 8? Wait, generated row4 for8:8 8 8 1 8 matches expected; but for4 row3 generated 4 1 1 1 4 vs expected 4 1 1 1 4—matches, but code pattern leads to inconsistencies elsewhere).
 * All training examples marked INCORRECT due to pattern mismatches, even where some rows coincidentally match (e.g., some bars in 4/6/8/9 correct, but 1/2/3 fail consistently).
 * Function `get_digit_patterns` is broken and not helpful as-is (wrong shapes for 1,3 at minimum; do not reuse without correcting from expected outputs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; extraction and grouping are essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it uses the same flawed patterns from the attempt, leading to incorrect digit shapes (e.g., for digit4 in first row, row3 would render as 4 3 4 3 4 per code pattern [1,0,1,0,1], but expected likely 4 3 1 3 4 or similar based on train1's 4 pattern; for digit1 in second row, row4 would be 1 3 3 1 1 vs likely expected 1 3 3 3 1; for digit3 in third row? Wait, third row has6 and9, but if patterns wrong for6? Train1 6 mostly matched, but overall test inherits errors like train3's 3 mismatches).
 * The structure (three rows: 4+8, 2+1, 6+9; bg=3; proper spacing) makes sense and matches extraction/grouping success from training, but shapes are wrong (e.g., generated row5 for first row digit8:8 8 8 8 8? No, per code for8 row5 all1 ok, but row4 [1,1,1,0,1]->8 8 8 3 8 vs possibly expected different; unknown without explicit expected, but patterns cause visible differences like extra/missing pixels in 1/2/6).
 * To handle test, update patterns to match training expectations (e.g., derive full set: 1 as thin with base; 2 as curved top/mid/bottom; 3 as open right with connections; etc.); test has more digits per example, so ensure no col overflow.

[2025-10-01 19:04:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background color, with the color value representing a specific digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), arranged in horizontal rows separated vertically by background space. The goal is to detect these blocks, group them by row, and render each as a predefined 5x5 binary pattern (1s as the digit's color, 0s as background) in a new output grid with background-filled borders and single-cell background separators between digits horizontally and full background rows between digit rows vertically.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input blocks are exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color; no partial or non-solid blocks should be extracted, and background is taken from top-left cell (often 0,1,3,4,8 in examples).
 * Digits supported are only 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 (no 0,5,7); if a color doesn't match, it should likely be skipped or treated as invalid, but all examples use valid colors.
 * Grouping blocks into rows: blocks in the same row have starting rows close enough (code uses <= last +5, which works for examples where rows are separated by exactly 1 bg row, but may need tightening if overlaps occur; sort by row then col).
 * Output structure: single top/bottom bg row, then for each group: 5 pattern rows + 1 full bg separator row (except after last group); horizontally, patterns start at col 1, spaced every 6 cols (5 pattern +1 bg separator), with left/right bg borders.
 * Patterns must be exactly binary 5x5 (1=on/pixel with digit color, 0=off/bg); the provided patterns are incorrect for several digits (e.g., 1,3), leading to mismatches—must reverse-engineer from expected outputs.
 * Subtle: Patterns are not symmetric or standard 7-segment; e.g., digit 1 is a thin vertical with serifs but wider base (row2/4: positions 1 and 5 on, 2-4 off; row3: 1-2 and 4-5 on), not the code's version. Digit 3 has a top bar, middle connections, but code's row2 is wrong (expected 1 0 0 0 1, not 1 0 1 0 1). No overlapping blocks or diagonal arrangements in examples. Background never appears inside blocks. Output dimensions must account for max blocks per row.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering uses the block's color for '1's in pattern, not a fixed color; separators are single bg cells/rows, not thicker. If no blocks, output minimal bg grid. All examples have even spacing, but test may vary row separation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful for extraction and rendering structure, but patterns need fixing:

```python

```

The `get_digit_patterns` function is helpful in structure but broken due to incorrect patterns (do not reuse as-is; must update to match expected shapes from training outputs, e.g., for 1: row1 all1, row2 [1,0,0,0,1], row3 [1,1,0,1,1], row4 [1,0,0,0,1], row5 all1; similar fixes for 3 and others).

The main `program` function integrates these well but fails due to patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single previous attempt provided; it correctly extracts solid 5x5 blocks using color as digit identifier and groups them into rows based on vertical proximity, producing correct overall structure (spacing, borders, number of digits/rows).
 * What worked: Block detection accurately identifies all solid 5x5 regions (e.g., in train1 detects three single-digit rows for 1/6/4; train2 one row with 1/2/3; train3 two rows with 8+4 and 3+9); grouping correctly clusters horizontal rows without merging across separators; output dimensions and rendering placement (with bg separators) match expected layout exactly, including borders and no extra space.
 * What didn't work: Digit patterns are incorrect, causing shape mismatches in all training examples (e.g., train1 digit1 row2 generated 1 8 8 1 1 vs expected 1 8 8 8 1; row3 generated 1 1 8 1 1 vs expected 1 1 8 1 1—wait, row3 matches by coincidence but overall wrong; train2 digit1 row4 generated 1 4 4 1 1 vs expected 1 4 4 4 1; digit3 row2 generated 3 4 3 4 3 vs expected 3 4 3 4 3—wait, some partial matches but train2 row4 for1 wrong; train3 digit3 row9 (k=1) generated 3 1 3 1 3 vs expected 3 1 1 1 3; row10 (k=2) generated 3 1 1 1 3 vs expected 3 3 1 3 3; digit8 row4 generated 8 1 1 8 8 vs expected 8 8 8 1 8? Wait, generated row4 for8:8 8 8 1 8 matches expected; but for4 row3 generated 4 1 1 1 4 vs expected 4 1 1 1 4—matches, but code pattern leads to inconsistencies elsewhere).
 * All training examples marked INCORRECT due to pattern mismatches, even where some rows coincidentally match (e.g., some bars in 4/6/8/9 correct, but 1/2/3 fail consistently).
 * Function `get_digit_patterns` is broken and not helpful as-is (wrong shapes for 1,3 at minimum; do not reuse without correcting from expected outputs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; extraction and grouping are essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it uses the same flawed patterns from the attempt, leading to incorrect digit shapes (e.g., for digit4 in first row, row3 would render as 4 3 4 3 4 per code pattern [1,0,1,0,1], but expected likely 4 3 1 3 4 or similar based on train1's 4 pattern; for digit1 in second row, row4 would be 1 3 3 1 1 vs likely expected 1 3 3 3 1; for digit3 in third row? Wait, third row has6 and9, but if patterns wrong for6? Train1 6 mostly matched, but overall test inherits errors like train3's 3 mismatches).
 * The structure (three rows: 4+8, 2+1, 6+9; bg=3; proper spacing) makes sense and matches extraction/grouping success from training, but shapes are wrong (e.g., generated row5 for first row digit8:8 8 8 8 8? No, per code for8 row5 all1 ok, but row4 [1,1,1,0,1]->8 8 8 3 8 vs possibly expected different; unknown without explicit expected, but patterns cause visible differences like extra/missing pixels in 1/2/6).
 * To handle test, update patterns to match training expectations (e.g., derive full set: 1 as thin with base; 2 as curved top/mid/bottom; 3 as open right with connections; etc.); test has more digits per example, so ensure no col overflow.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection of 5x5 "blocks" or pixel-art representations of digits (specifically 1,2,3,4,6,8,9) embedded in a larger grid, where the blocks are solid regions of a single non-background number surrounded by background (0 or other uniform value). The goal is to extract these blocks, group them logically (e.g., by approximate rows), sort them, and re-render them in a new bordered grid using predefined 5x5 patterns for each digit, separated by spacing and borders, effectively "decoding" or reformatting the input grid into a clean display of the digits.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color/value, with no internal variations or extensions beyond 5x5; the detection scans the grid row-by-row and column-by-column, skipping background (bg) areas.
 * Grouping logic assumes vertical proximity: blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units (to handle adjacency without overlap), then sorted by starting row for groups and by starting column within groups; this handles multi-row arrangements but may fail if blocks overlap or are diagonally placed.
 * Output grid uses the input's background value (bg) for borders and spacers: full border rows/columns of bg, 5-unit spacing between blocks in a group (6 units total per block including gap), and 1-unit vertical spacers between groups (leading to height = 6 * num_groups + 1, but code has a bug in current_row +=5 then +1 only if not last).
 * Patterns are hardcoded 5x5 matrices for digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9, where the digit value fills "on" pixels and 0 is transparent (replaced by bg in output); missing patterns for 0,5,7 mean unsupported digits are skipped.
 * Subtlety: Patterns must exactly match expected digit shapes, which appear to be stylized (e.g., like LCD/segment displays in 5x5); mismatches in "on" pixel positions cause incorrect outputs, as seen in training examples.
 * Input grids have uniform bg (e.g., 8 in train1, 1 in train3, 3 in test), and blocks don't overlap; empty input returns single bg cell.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering overlays patterns starting at offsets (row 1, col 1 for first, +6 per block), but only if the block's color matches a pattern key; vertical spacing adds extra bg row between groups, but code's current_row logic skips the final spacer correctly only if adjusted.
 * Detection assumes rectangular grid with n rows, m cols; no handling for irregular shapes or non-integer blocks.
 * Output preserves digit values but embeds them in bg-bordered cells, with no rotation, scaling, or color changes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes a main `program` function that handles detection, grouping, and rendering; no separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the block detection loop is useful as a core extractor. Below is an extracted/adapted version of the helpful block detection part (the rest of the program has pattern bugs):

```python
import typing as tp

def extract_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if g[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

The grouping and rendering parts in the original are partially helpful but buggy (e.g., pattern mismatches, spacing). No types beyond List[List[int]] are used. The `patterns` dict is essential but currently incorrect for some digits (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (previous submission); it correctly detects 5x5 blocks and groups them by row proximity/sorting, which works for basic extraction and placement in train2 (full match).
 * Block detection loop successfully identifies solid regions and skips bg, handling empty grids; this is core and reusable.
 * Grouping by row (sort by start_row, merge if <=5 apart) and within-group col sort works for vertical/horizontal arrangements, as in train3 where two blocks per "row" are placed side-by-side.
 * Rendering creates correct overall structure: bg borders, 6-unit wide slots per block, vertical spacers; train2 passed fully, showing core layout logic is sound for some cases.
 * Patterns dict is unhelpful/inaccurate: for digit 1, generated has incorrect "on" positions (e.g., row2: 1 at col2,8s elsewhere vs. expected more centered/top-heavy); for 6, row4 has 6 at col2,8,9-11 vs. expected; for 4 in train1/3, mismatches like row3 all 8s in center vs. expected partial 4s; for 3 in train3, row2/3 have wrong 3 placements (e.g., row3: 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,3,1,3? wait, expected has variations); for 9 similar issues in row3/4. These cause train1 and train3 to fail despite correct positions.
 * Sorting works (blocks by row then col), but assumes no overlaps/duplicates; didn't handle pattern transparency correctly (0s become bg, but positions wrong).
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the full `program` is broken due to pattern errors; the `extract_blocks` adaptation above is helpful and should be kept, while patterns need full rewrite from expected outputs.
 * Train1 mismatches: 1's pattern has extra 1s in wrong spots (e.g., row3 col3=1 vs. expected 8?); 6's row2/4 off; 4's row2/3/4/5 have misplaced 4s (e.g., row5 all 4s bottom vs. expected partial).
 * Train3 mismatches: 8/4 placement correct but patterns slightly off (minor for 8/4? but 4 in row3/4 wrong); 3's row2=3,1,3,1,3? generated has 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,1,1,3 (wait, similar but row3 generated 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,3,1,3,3; row4 similar); 9's row2 generated 9,1,9,1,9 vs. expected 9,1,9,1,9 (match?) but row3 9,1,1,9,9 vs. expected 9,1,1,9,9 (match) wait, actual diffs in row3/4 for 3/9 as noted.
 * Overall, detection/grouping solid (6/10 on that), rendering patterns fail (0/10), leading to partial success.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it detects and places two blocks per group (4 and 8 in row-group1, 2 and 1 in group2, 6 and 9 in group3), with bg=3 borders/spacers, correct 13-col width (6*2 +1 per group) and ~19-row height (6*3 +1, but with internal 5+1=6 per group); layout positions blocks at expected offsets (e.g., first group rows 1-5 cols1-5 for 4, 7-11 for 8).
 * However, it does not look fully correct due to pattern mismatches similar to training: for 4 (top-left), row3 has 4,3,3,3,4,4? wait generated row3: [3,4,3,3,3,4,3,...] which seems off vs. likely expected more structured (from train1's 4 pattern); for 8, row3/4 have 8,3,3,8,8 which may match a partial but row5 all 8s bottom ok?; for 2 (group2 left), row3:2,3,3,2,2 ok? but row4:2,3,2,3,2 vs. expected from patterns likely 2,0,2,0,2 filled; for 1 right of it, row4:1,3,3,3,1 wrong (overly sparse); for 6/9 in group3, similar issues (e.g., 6 row4:6,3,6,6,6 vs. expected from train1 6,8,6,6,6 filled). It extracts correctly but renders wrong shapes, so output is structurally right but visually distorted digits; to fix, derive exact patterns from all expected outputs (e.g., aggregate train1/3 diffs to correct dict). Unknown why some positions flip 3/bg, but likely pattern 0 placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:11:38] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background color, with each color value representing a specific digit (e.g., color 1 for digit 1, color 3 for digit 3), arranged potentially in rows. The task is to extract these blocks, group them into horizontal rows based on starting row proximity, and render each block as a predefined 5x5 binary pattern (using the block's color for '1' positions and background for '0' positions) in a new output grid with 1-cell borders, 1-cell spacing between digits in a row, and 1-cell horizontal separator lines between row groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input blocks are strictly solid 5x5 regions of the same non-background color; any variation within the 5x5 (e.g., patterns instead of solid) would fail extraction, but examples suggest inputs use solid blocks.
 * Background color is always the top-left cell value; skip any block starting with background color.
 * Grouping into rows: Sort blocks by starting (row, col), then group consecutively if the next block's starting row <= last in group's starting row + 5 (allows slight vertical misalignment, but examples likely have exact row alignment); within each group, sort by starting column for left-to-right order.
 * Output layout: 1-cell top/bottom/full borders (all background); each digit group separated by 1 full background row; within a row, digits placed at column 1 + 6*index (1-cell left border + 5 pattern + 1 space); height = 6 * num_groups + 1 (5 pattern + 1 separator per group, + top border); width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1 (similar spacing + right border).
 * Digit patterns must exactly match expected shapes (binary 5x5 where 1= color, 0=bg), which appear to be custom pixel-art styles (not standard 7-segment); e.g., for digit 4 (color 4 on bg 1), expected is top/full, then right column + middle horizontal, bottom/full, but with specific off positions—current patterns mismatch this.
 * Only render if color is a supported digit (1-9, possibly 0); unsupported colors (e.g., 3,5,7,0) are silently skipped, leading to missing digits and incorrect width/dimensions.
 * Subtle: Patterns for supported digits like 4 and 2 do not match expected outputs (e.g., 4's middle rows have wrong '1' positions, making it look like a malformed 'H' instead of a '4'); 8's pattern coincidentally matches expected in some examples. Extraction scans every possible 5x5 top-left position without overlap handling, which works if blocks don't overlap but could miss if blocks are adjacent without gap. Output initializes fully with bg, so unpainted areas remain bg (correct for padding/missing digits).
 * All examples use odd dimensions (e.g., 13 cols for 2 digits, 19 for 3); borders are full bg rows/cols. No rotation, scaling, or non-5x5 objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extract the background color from the top-left cell."""
    return grid[0][0] if grid and grid[0] else 0
```
(This is helpful and correct for identifying bg across all cases.)

```python
def extract_solid_5x5_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples.
    A solid block is a 5x5 region where all cells are the same non-background color."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    bg = get_background(grid)
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0]) if grid[0] else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if grid[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful and core for identifying solid digit blocks; correct assuming inputs are solid, but untested on patterned inputs—do not modify to handle patterns, as examples imply solid.)

```python
def group_into_rows(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Groups blocks into rows based on starting row proximity (within 5 units).
    Sorts groups by starting row and blocks within groups by starting column."""
    if not blocks:
        return []
    # Sort by starting row, then column
    sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b[0], b[1]))
    groups = []
    current_group = [sorted_blocks[0]]
    for block in sorted_blocks[1:]:
        if block[0] <= current_group[-1][0] + 5:
            current_group.append(block)
        else:
            # Sort current group by column
            current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = [block]
    # Sort last group by column
    current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
    groups.append(current_group)
    return groups
```
(This is helpful for row grouping and sorting; the +5 tolerance handles minor misalignments, but may need tightening to exact row if over-grouping occurs—worked for train1.)

```python
def compute_output_dimensions(groups: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Computes the height and width of the output grid based on number of groups and max blocks per group."""
    if not groups:
        return 1, 1
    num_groups = len(groups)
    max_blocks_per_row = max(len(group) for group in groups)
    height = 6 * num_groups + 1
    width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1
    return height, width
```
(This is helpful and correct for layout dimensions based on extracted groups.)

```python
def initialize_output_grid(height: int, width: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Initializes the output grid filled with background color."""
    return [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
```
(This is helpful and correct for bg-filled output.)

```python
def render_digit_pattern(pattern: List[List[int]], color: int, bg: int, start_row: int, start_col: int, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """Renders a 5x5 digit pattern into the grid at the given position, using color for 1s and bg for 0s."""
    for k in range(5):
        for l in range(5):
            val = color if pattern[k][l] == 1 else bg
            grid[start_row + k][start_col + l] = val
```
(This is helpful for painting patterns, but depends on correct patterns; positioning assumes 0-indexed start after borders.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly extracted and grouped for training example 1 (full match, including layout and patterns).
 * Missed extraction or grouping of the third block (color 3 for digit 3) in training example 2, resulting in only two digits rendered (1 and 2) with width/dimensions for two blocks instead of three; generated row 2 of expected third digit area is all bg (padding), differing from expected patterned 3.
 * In training example 3, correctly extracted and grouped first row (8 and 4), but rendered incorrect pattern for 4 (e.g., row 3: 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected 4,1,1,1,4; row 4: 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected 4,4,1,4,4—looks like symmetric 'H' not '4'); pattern for 8 matched expected. For second row, missed extraction/grouping of first block (3), rendering only the 9 with single-block width, leaving left side all bg (1) vs. expected full row with 3 pattern (e.g., row 8 left: all 1 vs. expected 3,3,3,3,3).
 * get_digit_patterns() is broken/unhelpful: Contains incorrect binary patterns for supported digits (e.g., 4 mismatches expected shape; 2's bottom-left may mismatch); missing entries for 3,5,7,0 (causes skips/missing digits); do not reuse current version—must redefine with exact expected shapes (e.g., derive from train3's 3 and 4, train2's 3).
 * extract_solid_5x5_blocks is essential and mostly correct but may fail if input blocks have any non-solid cells (unknown if inputs are always solid, but implied yes); no overlap deduping, but examples likely non-overlapping.
 * group_into_rows worked for train1 and partial train3 but failed to include 3 in train3 second group (possibly due to row start > +5 from 9, or extraction miss—unknown reason).
 * compute_output_dimensions correct but inherits errors from missing groups (wrong width if digits skipped).
 * Overall, core extraction/layout understood but digit recognition/rendering flawed (wrong/missing patterns lead to visual mismatches); solid assumption may be correct but unverified on non-solid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it renders six digits across three groups (first: 4-pattern and 8-pattern; second: 2-pattern and 1-pattern; third: 6-pattern and 9-pattern), with correct spacing/borders/bg=3, but uses the same flawed patterns as training (e.g., 4's shape is malformed as in train3: row 3 likely 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected '4' like train3's 4,1,1,1,4; 2's pattern may mismatch expected curves). This results in inaccurate digit representations, and if test input has a 3/5/7/0, it would be missing (like train2/3), leading to incomplete rows/wrong widths. The output makes sense structurally (groups by row proximity, sorted left-right) but fails visually due to pattern errors—does not match expected if standards follow train examples (e.g., no solid rows where patterns should have gaps).

- **Colored polyomino shapes**: Various tetrominoes and smaller polyominoes (e.g., L, J, T, S, Z, O/square, I/straight, U, H-like) in solid colors including yellow, green, blue, cyan, magenta/pink, orange, red, purple/maroon, arranged in grids or stacks on contrasting backgrounds (e.g., maroon, green).
- **Solid color squares**: Larger uniform blocks in yellow, blue, red, purple/magenta, cyan, maroon/brown, positioned as targets or outputs adjacent to shape arrangements.
- **Grid layouts**: Input sides feature clustered small shapes in rows/columns (e.g., 2-3 shapes per row, mixed orientations); output sides show single large colored squares; vertical stacks in one example with bordered frames in maroon.
- **Backgrounds and borders**: Predominantly maroon or green fields with some framed sections (e.g., yellow-bordered vertical stack), implying transformation or matching from input shapes to output colors.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 19:11:50] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Colored polyomino shapes**: Various tetrominoes and smaller polyominoes (e.g., L, J, T, S, Z, O/square, I/straight, U, H-like) in solid colors including yellow, green, blue, cyan, magenta/pink, orange, red, purple/maroon, arranged in grids or stacks on contrasting backgrounds (e.g., maroon, green).
- **Solid color squares**: Larger uniform blocks in yellow, blue, red, purple/magenta, cyan, maroon/brown, positioned as targets or outputs adjacent to shape arrangements.
- **Grid layouts**: Input sides feature clustered small shapes in rows/columns (e.g., 2-3 shapes per row, mixed orientations); output sides show single large colored squares; vertical stacks in one example with bordered frames in maroon.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, position, holes, pixels) and components (e.g., large 5x5 blocks, small polyominoes, background) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in identical ways in all cases. No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small shape orientations like L/J/T that do not uniformly interact, variable pixel counts without clear linkage, or one-off positions) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel reduction mechanics in large blocks, color shifts in small shapes) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Large 5x5 solid blocks (input) → Large 5x5 blocks with holes (output)**:
   - Components: Full solid 5x5 colored polyominoes (bbox width/height=5 units, pixels=25, holes=0) in input.
   - Interaction: These always transform into output blocks of the **same color**, similar bbox size (width/height=5 units), but with added holes (holes ≥1) and reduced pixels (pixels=18-20). Position is preserved in grid layouts (e.g., top row or 2x2 grid); in vertical stack layouts, x-position shifts left (from right edge to left edge, e.g., x=13-17 to x=1-5) while y-positions remain consistent.
   - Consistency: Occurs in all 3 trains (3 blocks in trains 1-2, 4 in train 3; each input block maps 1:1 to an output block with holes).

2. **Number of large 5x5 blocks (input) → Background holes (output)**:
   - Components: Count of large 5x5 solid blocks in input; background shape in output (large bbox covering grid, e.g., [0,0,X,18], high pixels).
   - Interaction: The exact count of input large 5x5 blocks determines the number of holes in the output background (e.g., 3 blocks → 3 holes; 4 blocks → 4 holes).
   - Consistency: Direct 1:1 numerical match in all 3 trains; no exceptions.

3. **Background color (input) → Background color and small polyomino colors (output)**:
   - Components: Background shape in input (large bbox, high holes=11-17, high pixels=247-293); background and all small polyominoes (<5x5 bbox, low pixels=1-7) in output.
   - Interaction: Input background color is preserved as output background color; additionally, **all** small polyominoes in output adopt this exact background color (overriding any input small shape colors).
   - Consistency: Color match for background in all 3 trains; all output small polyominoes (3-6 per output) use input background color in all 3 trains. (Note: Pixel counts and exact bboxes of output small polyominoes vary but consistently match input small polyomino pixel ranges of 1-7; positions often align near/under large blocks but not uniformly enough for a position rule.)

4. **Background holes (input) → Background holes (output)**:
   - Components: Background shape in both input and output.
   - Interaction: Input background holes (high count=11-17) always reduce to a low count (3-4) in output, with preserved color and large bbox (though bbox dimensions vary slightly, e.g., 6x18 vs. 12x12).
   - Consistency: Reduction occurs in all 3 trains; exact low count ties to large block count (see #2), but reduction itself is uniform.

### Notes on Unknowns/Limitations
- Small polyominoes in input (various colors, pixels=1-7, scattered positions) consistently produce small polyominoes in output (background color, similar pixels=1-7), but the exact color override mechanism and position mapping (e.g., why some shift under large blocks) is unknown and not consistent enough across layouts (vertical vs. grid) to specify further.
- Holes added to large 5x5 blocks (1-3 per block) appear consistently, but their count per block does not have an obvious uniform trigger (e.g., not directly tied to total small polyomino pixels or specific input colors across all trains).
- Pixel reductions in large 5x5 blocks (from 25 to 18-20) and background (high to ~58-69) are consistent in direction but lack a clear, uniform cause (e.g., not fixed subtraction; varies slightly without matching input property across all examples).
- No other interactions (e.g., specific color-to-color transforms like Green → Blue, or hole count in small shapes affecting anything) are consistent in every train; many small input elements (e.g., Orange, Dark Red) lack clear output counterparts or uniform effects.
- Grid size varies slightly (18x18 vs. 22x18), but does not affect the above connections.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 19:12:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background color, with the color value representing a specific digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), arranged in horizontal rows separated vertically by background space. The goal is to detect these blocks, group them by row, and render each as a predefined 5x5 binary pattern (1s as the digit's color, 0s as background) in a new output grid with background-filled borders and single-cell background separators between digits horizontally and full background rows between digit rows vertically.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input blocks are exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color; no partial or non-solid blocks should be extracted, and background is taken from top-left cell (often 0,1,3,4,8 in examples).
 * Digits supported are only 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 (no 0,5,7); if a color doesn't match, it should likely be skipped or treated as invalid, but all examples use valid colors.
 * Grouping blocks into rows: blocks in the same row have starting rows close enough (code uses <= last +5, which works for examples where rows are separated by exactly 1 bg row, but may need tightening if overlaps occur; sort by row then col).
 * Output structure: single top/bottom bg row, then for each group: 5 pattern rows + 1 full bg separator row (except after last group); horizontally, patterns start at col 1, spaced every 6 cols (5 pattern +1 bg separator), with left/right bg borders.
 * Patterns must be exactly binary 5x5 (1=on/pixel with digit color, 0=off/bg); the provided patterns are incorrect for several digits (e.g., 1,3), leading to mismatches—must reverse-engineer from expected outputs.
 * Subtle: Patterns are not symmetric or standard 7-segment; e.g., digit 1 is a thin vertical with serifs but wider base (row2/4: positions 1 and 5 on, 2-4 off; row3: 1-2 and 4-5 on), not the code's version. Digit 3 has a top bar, middle connections, but code's row2 is wrong (expected 1 0 0 0 1, not 1 0 1 0 1). No overlapping blocks or diagonal arrangements in examples. Background never appears inside blocks. Output dimensions must account for max blocks per row.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering uses the block's color for '1's in pattern, not a fixed color; separators are single bg cells/rows, not thicker. If no blocks, output minimal bg grid. All examples have even spacing, but test may vary row separation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful for extraction and rendering structure, but patterns need fixing:

```python
def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extract the background color from the top-left cell."""
    return grid[0][0] if grid and grid[0] else 0
```

```python
def extract_solid_5x5_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples.
    A solid block is a 5x5 region where all cells are the same non-background color."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    bg = get_background(grid)
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0]) if grid[0] else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if grid[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

```python
def group_into_rows(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Groups blocks into rows based on starting row proximity (within 5 units).
    Sorts groups by starting row and blocks within groups by starting column."""
    if not blocks:
        return []
    # Sort by starting row, then column
    sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b[0], b[1]))
    groups = []
    current_group = [sorted_blocks[0]]
    for block in sorted_blocks[1:]:
        if block[0] <= current_group[-1][0] + 5:
            current_group.append(block)
        else:
            # Sort current group by column
            current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = [block]
    # Sort last group by column
    current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
    groups.append(current_group)
    return groups
```

```python
def compute_output_dimensions(groups: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Computes the height and width of the output grid based on number of groups and max blocks per group."""
    if not groups:
        return 1, 1
    num_groups = len(groups)
    max_blocks_per_row = max(len(group) for group in groups)
    height = 6 * num_groups + 1
    width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1
    return height, width
```

```python
def initialize_output_grid(height: int, width: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Initializes the output grid filled with background color."""
    return [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
```

```python
def render_digit_pattern(pattern: List[List[int]], color: int, bg: int, start_row: int, start_col: int, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """Renders a 5x5 digit pattern into the grid at the given position, using color for 1s and bg for 0s."""
    for k in range(5):
        for l in range(5):
            val = color if pattern[k][l] == 1 else bg
            grid[start_row + k][start_col + l] = val
```

The `get_digit_patterns` function is helpful in structure but broken due to incorrect patterns (do not reuse as-is; must update to match expected shapes from training outputs, e.g., for 1: row1 all1, row2 [1,0,0,0,1], row3 [1,1,0,1,1], row4 [1,0,0,0,1], row5 all1; similar fixes for 3 and others).

The main `program` function integrates these well but fails due to patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single previous attempt provided; it correctly extracts solid 5x5 blocks using color as digit identifier and groups them into rows based on vertical proximity, producing correct overall structure (spacing, borders, number of digits/rows).
 * What worked: Block detection accurately identifies all solid 5x5 regions (e.g., in train1 detects three single-digit rows for 1/6/4; train2 one row with 1/2/3; train3 two rows with 8+4 and 3+9); grouping correctly clusters horizontal rows without merging across separators; output dimensions and rendering placement (with bg separators) match expected layout exactly, including borders and no extra space.
 * What didn't work: Digit patterns are incorrect, causing shape mismatches in all training examples (e.g., train1 digit1 row2 generated 1 8 8 1 1 vs expected 1 8 8 8 1; row3 generated 1 1 8 1 1 vs expected 1 1 8 1 1—wait, row3 matches by coincidence but overall wrong; train2 digit1 row4 generated 1 4 4 1 1 vs expected 1 4 4 4 1; digit3 row2 generated 3 4 3 4 3 vs expected 3 4 3 4 3—wait, some partial matches but train2 row4 for1 wrong; train3 digit3 row9 (k=1) generated 3 1 3 1 3 vs expected 3 1 1 1 3; row10 (k=2) generated 3 1 1 1 3 vs expected 3 3 1 3 3; digit8 row4 generated 8 1 1 8 8 vs expected 8 8 8 1 8? Wait, generated row4 for8:8 8 8 1 8 matches expected; but for4 row3 generated 4 1 1 1 4 vs expected 4 1 1 1 4—matches, but code pattern leads to inconsistencies elsewhere).
 * All training examples marked INCORRECT due to pattern mismatches, even where some rows coincidentally match (e.g., some bars in 4/6/8/9 correct, but 1/2/3 fail consistently).
 * Function `get_digit_patterns` is broken and not helpful as-is (wrong shapes for 1,3 at minimum; do not reuse without correcting from expected outputs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; extraction and grouping are essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it uses the same flawed patterns from the attempt, leading to incorrect digit shapes (e.g., for digit4 in first row, row3 would render as 4 3 4 3 4 per code pattern [1,0,1,0,1], but expected likely 4 3 1 3 4 or similar based on train1's 4 pattern; for digit1 in second row, row4 would be 1 3 3 1 1 vs likely expected 1 3 3 3 1; for digit3 in third row? Wait, third row has6 and9, but if patterns wrong for6? Train1 6 mostly matched, but overall test inherits errors like train3's 3 mismatches).
 * The structure (three rows: 4+8, 2+1, 6+9; bg=3; proper spacing) makes sense and matches extraction/grouping success from training, but shapes are wrong (e.g., generated row5 for first row digit8:8 8 8 8 8? No, per code for8 row5 all1 ok, but row4 [1,1,1,0,1]->8 8 8 3 8 vs possibly expected different; unknown without explicit expected, but patterns cause visible differences like extra/missing pixels in 1/2/6).
 * To handle test, update patterns to match training expectations (e.g., derive full set: 1 as thin with base; 2 as curved top/mid/bottom; 3 as open right with connections; etc.); test has more digits per example, so ensure no col overflow.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background color, with each color value representing a specific digit (e.g., color 1 for digit 1, color 3 for digit 3), arranged potentially in rows. The task is to extract these blocks, group them into horizontal rows based on starting row proximity, and render each block as a predefined 5x5 binary pattern (using the block's color for '1' positions and background for '0' positions) in a new output grid with 1-cell borders, 1-cell spacing between digits in a row, and 1-cell horizontal separator lines between row groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input blocks are strictly solid 5x5 regions of the same non-background color; any variation within the 5x5 (e.g., patterns instead of solid) would fail extraction, but examples suggest inputs use solid blocks.
 * Background color is always the top-left cell value; skip any block starting with background color.
 * Grouping into rows: Sort blocks by starting (row, col), then group consecutively if the next block's starting row <= last in group's starting row + 5 (allows slight vertical misalignment, but examples likely have exact row alignment); within each group, sort by starting column for left-to-right order.
 * Output layout: 1-cell top/bottom/full borders (all background); each digit group separated by 1 full background row; within a row, digits placed at column 1 + 6*index (1-cell left border + 5 pattern + 1 space); height = 6 * num_groups + 1 (5 pattern + 1 separator per group, + top border); width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1 (similar spacing + right border).
 * Digit patterns must exactly match expected shapes (binary 5x5 where 1= color, 0=bg), which appear to be custom pixel-art styles (not standard 7-segment); e.g., for digit 4 (color 4 on bg 1), expected is top/full, then right column + middle horizontal, bottom/full, but with specific off positions—current patterns mismatch this.
 * Only render if color is a supported digit (1-9, possibly 0); unsupported colors (e.g., 3,5,7,0) are silently skipped, leading to missing digits and incorrect width/dimensions.
 * Subtle: Patterns for supported digits like 4 and 2 do not match expected outputs (e.g., 4's middle rows have wrong '1' positions, making it look like a malformed 'H' instead of a '4'); 8's pattern coincidentally matches expected in some examples. Extraction scans every possible 5x5 top-left position without overlap handling, which works if blocks don't overlap but could miss if blocks are adjacent without gap. Output initializes fully with bg, so unpainted areas remain bg (correct for padding/missing digits).
 * All examples use odd dimensions (e.g., 13 cols for 2 digits, 19 for 3); borders are full bg rows/cols. No rotation, scaling, or non-5x5 objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extract the background color from the top-left cell."""
    return grid[0][0] if grid and grid[0] else 0
```
(This is helpful and correct for identifying bg across all cases.)

```python
def extract_solid_5x5_blocks(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples.
    A solid block is a 5x5 region where all cells are the same non-background color."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:

    bg = get_background(grid)
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0]) if grid[0] else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:

                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful and core for identifying solid digit blocks; correct assuming inputs are solid, but untested on patterned inputs—do not modify to handle patterns, as examples imply solid.)

```python
def group_into_rows(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Groups blocks into rows based on starting row proximity (within 5 units).
    Sorts groups by starting row and blocks within groups by starting column."""
    if not blocks:
        return []
    # Sort by starting row, then column
    sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b[0], b[1]))
    groups = []
    current_group = [sorted_blocks[0]]
    for block in sorted_blocks[1:]:
        if block[0] <= current_group[-1][0] + 5:
            current_group.append(block)
        else:
            # Sort current group by column
            current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = [block]
    # Sort last group by column
    current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
    groups.append(current_group)
    return groups
```
(This is helpful for row grouping and sorting; the +5 tolerance handles minor misalignments, but may need tightening to exact row if over-grouping occurs—worked for train1.)

```python
def compute_output_dimensions(groups: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Computes the height and width of the output grid based on number of groups and max blocks per group."""
    if not groups:
        return 1, 1
    num_groups = len(groups)
    max_blocks_per_row = max(len(group) for group in groups)
    height = 6 * num_groups + 1
    width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1
    return height, width
```
(This is helpful and correct for layout dimensions based on extracted groups.)

```python
def initialize_output_grid(height: int, width: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Initializes the output grid filled with background color."""
    return [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
```
(This is helpful and correct for bg-filled output.)

```python
def render_digit_pattern(pattern: List[List[int]], color: int, bg: int, start_row: int, start_col: int, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """Renders a 5x5 digit pattern into the grid at the given position, using color for 1s and bg for 0s."""
    for k in range(5):
        for l in range(5):
            val = color if pattern[k][l] == 1 else bg
            grid[start_row + k][start_col + l] = val
```
(This is helpful for painting patterns, but depends on correct patterns; positioning assumes 0-indexed start after borders.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly extracted and grouped for training example 1 (full match, including layout and patterns).
 * Missed extraction or grouping of the third block (color 3 for digit 3) in training example 2, resulting in only two digits rendered (1 and 2) with width/dimensions for two blocks instead of three; generated row 2 of expected third digit area is all bg (padding), differing from expected patterned 3.
 * In training example 3, correctly extracted and grouped first row (8 and 4), but rendered incorrect pattern for 4 (e.g., row 3: 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected 4,1,1,1,4; row 4: 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected 4,4,1,4,4—looks like symmetric 'H' not '4'); pattern for 8 matched expected. For second row, missed extraction/grouping of first block (3), rendering only the 9 with single-block width, leaving left side all bg (1) vs. expected full row with 3 pattern (e.g., row 8 left: all 1 vs. expected 3,3,3,3,3).
 * get_digit_patterns() is broken/unhelpful: Contains incorrect binary patterns for supported digits (e.g., 4 mismatches expected shape; 2's bottom-left may mismatch); missing entries for 3,5,7,0 (causes skips/missing digits); do not reuse current version—must redefine with exact expected shapes (e.g., derive from train3's 3 and 4, train2's 3).
 * extract_solid_5x5_blocks is essential and mostly correct but may fail if input blocks have any non-solid cells (unknown if inputs are always solid, but implied yes); no overlap deduping, but examples likely non-overlapping.
 * group_into_rows worked for train1 and partial train3 but failed to include 3 in train3 second group (possibly due to row start > +5 from 9, or extraction miss—unknown reason).
 * compute_output_dimensions correct but inherits errors from missing groups (wrong width if digits skipped).
 * Overall, core extraction/layout understood but digit recognition/rendering flawed (wrong/missing patterns lead to visual mismatches); solid assumption may be correct but unverified on non-solid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it renders six digits across three groups (first: 4-pattern and 8-pattern; second: 2-pattern and 1-pattern; third: 6-pattern and 9-pattern), with correct spacing/borders/bg=3, but uses the same flawed patterns as training (e.g., 4's shape is malformed as in train3: row 3 likely 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected '4' like train3's 4,1,1,1,4; 2's pattern may mismatch expected curves). This results in inaccurate digit representations, and if test input has a 3/5/7/0, it would be missing (like train2/3), leading to incomplete rows/wrong widths. The output makes sense structurally (groups by row proximity, sorted left-right) but fails visually due to pattern errors—does not match expected if standards follow train examples (e.g., no solid rows where patterns should have gaps).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection of 5x5 "blocks" or pixel-art representations of digits (specifically 1,2,3,4,6,8,9) embedded in a larger grid, where the blocks are solid regions of a single non-background number surrounded by background (0 or other uniform value). The goal is to extract these blocks, group them logically (e.g., by approximate rows), sort them, and re-render them in a new bordered grid using predefined 5x5 patterns for each digit, separated by spacing and borders, effectively "decoding" or reformatting the input grid into a clean display of the digits.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color/value, with no internal variations or extensions beyond 5x5; the detection scans the grid row-by-row and column-by-column, skipping background (bg) areas.
 * Grouping logic assumes vertical proximity: blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units (to handle adjacency without overlap), then sorted by starting row for groups and by starting column within groups; this handles multi-row arrangements but may fail if blocks overlap or are diagonally placed.
 * Output grid uses the input's background value (bg) for borders and spacers: full border rows/columns of bg, 5-unit spacing between blocks in a group (6 units total per block including gap), and 1-unit vertical spacers between groups (leading to height = 6 * num_groups + 1, but code has a bug in current_row +=5 then +1 only if not last).
 * Patterns are hardcoded 5x5 matrices for digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9, where the digit value fills "on" pixels and 0 is transparent (replaced by bg in output); missing patterns for 0,5,7 mean unsupported digits are skipped.
 * Subtlety: Patterns must exactly match expected digit shapes, which appear to be stylized (e.g., like LCD/segment displays in 5x5); mismatches in "on" pixel positions cause incorrect outputs, as seen in training examples.
 * Input grids have uniform bg (e.g., 8 in train1, 1 in train3, 3 in test), and blocks don't overlap; empty input returns single bg cell.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering overlays patterns starting at offsets (row 1, col 1 for first, +6 per block), but only if the block's color matches a pattern key; vertical spacing adds extra bg row between groups, but code's current_row logic skips the final spacer correctly only if adjusted.
 * Detection assumes rectangular grid with n rows, m cols; no handling for irregular shapes or non-integer blocks.
 * Output preserves digit values but embeds them in bg-bordered cells, with no rotation, scaling, or color changes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes a main `program` function that handles detection, grouping, and rendering; no separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the block detection loop is useful as a core extractor. Below is an extracted/adapted version of the helpful block detection part (the rest of the program has pattern bugs):

```python
import typing as tp

def extract_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if g[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

The grouping and rendering parts in the original are partially helpful but buggy (e.g., pattern mismatches, spacing). No types beyond List[List[int]] are used. The `patterns` dict is essential but currently incorrect for some digits (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (previous submission); it correctly detects 5x5 blocks and groups them by row proximity/sorting, which works for basic extraction and placement in train2 (full match).
 * Block detection loop successfully identifies solid regions and skips bg, handling empty grids; this is core and reusable.
 * Grouping by row (sort by start_row, merge if <=5 apart) and within-group col sort works for vertical/horizontal arrangements, as in train3 where two blocks per "row" are placed side-by-side.
 * Rendering creates correct overall structure: bg borders, 6-unit wide slots per block, vertical spacers; train2 passed fully, showing core layout logic is sound for some cases.
 * Patterns dict is unhelpful/inaccurate: for digit 1, generated has incorrect "on" positions (e.g., row2: 1 at col2,8s elsewhere vs. expected more centered/top-heavy); for 6, row4 has 6 at col2,8,9-11 vs. expected; for 4 in train1/3, mismatches like row3 all 8s in center vs. expected partial 4s; for 3 in train3, row2/3 have wrong 3 placements (e.g., row3: 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,3,1,3? wait, expected has variations); for 9 similar issues in row3/4. These cause train1 and train3 to fail despite correct positions.
 * Sorting works (blocks by row then col), but assumes no overlaps/duplicates; didn't handle pattern transparency correctly (0s become bg, but positions wrong).
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the full `program` is broken due to pattern errors; the `extract_blocks` adaptation above is helpful and should be kept, while patterns need full rewrite from expected outputs.
 * Train1 mismatches: 1's pattern has extra 1s in wrong spots (e.g., row3 col3=1 vs. expected 8?); 6's row2/4 off; 4's row2/3/4/5 have misplaced 4s (e.g., row5 all 4s bottom vs. expected partial).
 * Train3 mismatches: 8/4 placement correct but patterns slightly off (minor for 8/4? but 4 in row3/4 wrong); 3's row2=3,1,3,1,3? generated has 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,1,1,3 (wait, similar but row3 generated 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,3,1,3,3; row4 similar); 9's row2 generated 9,1,9,1,9 vs. expected 9,1,9,1,9 (match?) but row3 9,1,1,9,9 vs. expected 9,1,1,9,9 (match) wait, actual diffs in row3/4 for 3/9 as noted.
 * Overall, detection/grouping solid (6/10 on that), rendering patterns fail (0/10), leading to partial success.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it detects and places two blocks per group (4 and 8 in row-group1, 2 and 1 in group2, 6 and 9 in group3), with bg=3 borders/spacers, correct 13-col width (6*2 +1 per group) and ~19-row height (6*3 +1, but with internal 5+1=6 per group); layout positions blocks at expected offsets (e.g., first group rows 1-5 cols1-5 for 4, 7-11 for 8).
 * However, it does not look fully correct due to pattern mismatches similar to training: for 4 (top-left), row3 has 4,3,3,3,4,4? wait generated row3: [3,4,3,3,3,4,3,...] which seems off vs. likely expected more structured (from train1's 4 pattern); for 8, row3/4 have 8,3,3,8,8 which may match a partial but row5 all 8s bottom ok?; for 2 (group2 left), row3:2,3,3,2,2 ok? but row4:2,3,2,3,2 vs. expected from patterns likely 2,0,2,0,2 filled; for 1 right of it, row4:1,3,3,3,1 wrong (overly sparse); for 6/9 in group3, similar issues (e.g., 6 row4:6,3,6,6,6 vs. expected from train1 6,8,6,6,6 filled). It extracts correctly but renders wrong shapes, so output is structurally right but visually distorted digits; to fix, derive exact patterns from all expected outputs (e.g., aggregate train1/3 diffs to correct dict). Unknown why some positions flip 3/bg, but likely pattern 0 placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **every** train input/output pair. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, position, holes, pixels) and components (e.g., large 5x5 blocks, small polyominoes, background) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in identical ways in all cases. No high-level interpretations or solutions are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small shape orientations like L/J/T that do not uniformly interact, variable pixel counts without clear linkage, or one-off positions) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel reduction mechanics in large blocks, color shifts in small shapes) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Large 5x5 solid blocks (input) → Large 5x5 blocks with holes (output)**:
   - Components: Full solid 5x5 colored polyominoes (bbox width/height=5 units, pixels=25, holes=0) in input.
   - Interaction: These always transform into output blocks of the **same color**, similar bbox size (width/height=5 units), but with added holes (holes ≥1) and reduced pixels (pixels=18-20). Position is preserved in grid layouts (e.g., top row or 2x2 grid); in vertical stack layouts, x-position shifts left (from right edge to left edge, e.g., x=13-17 to x=1-5) while y-positions remain consistent.
   - Consistency: Occurs in all 3 trains (3 blocks in trains 1-2, 4 in train 3; each input block maps 1:1 to an output block with holes).

2. **Number of large 5x5 blocks (input) → Background holes (output)**:
   - Components: Count of large 5x5 solid blocks in input; background shape in output (large bbox covering grid, e.g., [0,0,X,18], high pixels).
   - Interaction: The exact count of input large 5x5 blocks determines the number of holes in the output background (e.g., 3 blocks → 3 holes; 4 blocks → 4 holes).
   - Consistency: Direct 1:1 numerical match in all 3 trains; no exceptions.

3. **Background color (input) → Background color and small polyomino colors (output)**:
   - Components: Background shape in input (large bbox, high holes=11-17, high pixels=247-293); background and all small polyominoes (<5x5 bbox, low pixels=1-7) in output.
   - Interaction: Input background color is preserved as output background color; additionally, **all** small polyominoes in output adopt this exact background color (overriding any input small shape colors).
   - Consistency: Color match for background in all 3 trains; all output small polyominoes (3-6 per output) use input background color in all 3 trains. (Note: Pixel counts and exact bboxes of output small polyominoes vary but consistently match input small polyomino pixel ranges of 1-7; positions often align near/under large blocks but not uniformly enough for a position rule.)

4. **Background holes (input) → Background holes (output)**:
   - Components: Background shape in both input and output.
   - Interaction: Input background holes (high count=11-17) always reduce to a low count (3-4) in output, with preserved color and large bbox (though bbox dimensions vary slightly, e.g., 6x18 vs. 12x12).
   - Consistency: Reduction occurs in all 3 trains; exact low count ties to large block count (see #2), but reduction itself is uniform.

### Notes on Unknowns/Limitations
- Small polyominoes in input (various colors, pixels=1-7, scattered positions) consistently produce small polyominoes in output (background color, similar pixels=1-7), but the exact color override mechanism and position mapping (e.g., why some shift under large blocks) is unknown and not consistent enough across layouts (vertical vs. grid) to specify further.
- Holes added to large 5x5 blocks (1-3 per block) appear consistently, but their count per block does not have an obvious uniform trigger (e.g., not directly tied to total small polyomino pixels or specific input colors across all trains).
- Pixel reductions in large 5x5 blocks (from 25 to 18-20) and background (high to ~58-69) are consistent in direction but lack a clear, uniform cause (e.g., not fixed subtraction; varies slightly without matching input property across all examples).
- No other interactions (e.g., specific color-to-color transforms like Green → Blue, or hole count in small shapes affecting anything) are consistent in every train; many small input elements (e.g., Orange, Dark Red) lack clear output counterparts or uniform effects.
- Grid size varies slightly (18x18 vs. 22x18), but does not affect the above connections.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 19:23:44] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large 5x5 solid-color blocks (non-background) as "digits" or objects, grouping them into visual rows, and then generating a new formatted grid where each block is rendered as a 5x5 binary pattern (using the block's color for 1s and background for 0s) derived from the positions of smaller, uncovered pixels of the same color elsewhere in the input grid. The output grid arranges these patterns in rows separated by background lines, with column spacing, effectively "decoding" or simplifying the input into a cleaner digit-like representation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (grid[0][0]), and all solid 5x5 blocks must be uniformly non-background; overlapping or partial blocks are ignored.
 * Blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units of each other; within groups, sort by starting column for left-to-right order.
 * Output dimensions: height = 6 * num_groups + 1 (for separators), width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1; borders and separators are background color, patterns placed at offsets like row 1,7,13,... and col 1,7,13,...
 * Patterns start as all 1s (full block), but are modified to 0s based on "small pixels" (same-color cells not covered by any 5x5 block); these small pixels are grouped by their row, sorted, and mapped to pattern rows (ii+1), with column offsets computed using modulo 5, a shift (sh = 0 if block_col1 %5 ==3 else -1), and relative to the block's starting column (sc).
 * Covered cells: All cells within any detected 5x5 block are marked covered globally, so small pixels are only non-block remnants of the color.
 * Subtle shift logic: The shift (sh) depends on the block's 1-based starting column modulo 5 (specifically if ==3, sh=0 else -1), and offsets are (col1 %5 + sh +5)%5, where col1 is 1-based small pixel column; multiple small pixels per row create multiple 0s.
 * Easy to miss: Small pixels can be anywhere (not just near the block), but mapping assumes they represent "features" to subtract from the full 5x5; if no small pixels, pattern is all 1s (solid).
 * Output rendering: Patterns use the block's color for 1s, bg for 0s; entire output bordered by bg, with vertical/horizontal separators of bg.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]] or [[0]]; no blocks means [[bg]]; patterns clipped if >4 rows of small pixels (pat_r >4 skipped).
 * Global considerations: Colors are integers (e.g., 1=bg in some, 3 in test); assume square-ish input but handle rectangular; no rotation or scaling, exact 5x5 detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating successful block extraction, row grouping, output sizing, initialization, and basic rendering; pattern computation worked for those cases (likely simpler small pixel distributions).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated patterns for first block (left, color 8) show full top/bottom rows but incorrect middle: row3 has 1,1,1,8,8,8 vs expected 1,8,1,1,8,8; row4 same issue 1,1,1,8,8,8 vs 1,8,1,1,8,8; row5 1,8,8,1,8,8 vs 1,8,8,8,1,8—suggests offset/shift logic or small pixel mapping is misaligned (possibly wrong modulo or shift application, leading to too many 1s in left columns).
 * For second block in train 3 (color 4): Similar misalignment, row3 4,1,4,1,4,1 (expected same, but wait no—generated matches expected for this? Wait, generated row3 right:4,1,4,1,4,1 expected same; but row5:4,4,1,4,4,1 expected same; actually upon close look, the provided generated and expected differ mainly in left block, right seems closer but row4 right generated 4,1,1,1,4,1 expected same—wait, they match for right? No, the paste shows generated row4 right:4,1,1,1,4,1 expected same; but left differs. Overall, pattern for left block wrong, right partially ok, but code treats symmetrically so likely global shift bug.
 * Covered set computation works (global across all blocks), as it prevents using block cells as small pixels.
 * Pattern computation function is partially broken: Starts with all 1s, groups small by row, maps to pat_r=ii+1, but offset calc uses block_col1 = sc +1 (1-based), sh=0 if %5==3 else -1, then for each small col: raw=col1%5, ll=(raw+sh+5)%5, set pat[pat_r][ll]=0; this seems intended to align small pixels relative to block position, but in train3 it over-sets or mis-shifts 0s, leaving extra 1s in early columns (e.g., positions 1-2 stay 1 instead of 0).
 * Grouping and rendering positions correct (separators at every 6 rows/cols, starting at 1).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, but compute_pattern inline in main is messy/incomplete in the code snippet (comments note errors like missing sc param).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a 19-row grid (3 groups *6 +1=19, correct sizing for 3 rows of 2 digits each), with bg=3 borders/separators, and patterns for colors 4/8 (first row), 2/1 (second), 6/9 (third), but the patterns appear mangled similar to train3 errors.
 * First group (rows 2-6): Left (4) has row3:3,3,3,4,4,4 (too many left 3s/bg, expected more 0s carved out); row4:3,4,3,4,4,4 (misaligned 0s); row5:3,4,3,3,4,4 (extra bg in col3); right (8) row3:8,8,3,3,3,3 (too many right bg, unlike expected digit shapes).
 * Second group (rows 8-12): Left (2) row9:2,2,3,3,2,2? Wait, row8 is top full, row9:2,3,3,3,2,2? No—row9:3,2,3,3,2,2,3 (scattered); row10:3,2,2,3,2,2,3 (clumped but wrong positions); looks like shift misapplies, creating non-digit-like blobs instead of clear 2/1 shapes.
 * Third group (rows 14-18): Similar issues, left (6) row15:6,3,6,6,6 (gap in col2); row16:6,6,3,3,6 (gaps in 3-4); right (9) row15:9,3,9,9,9 (gap col2); overall, patterns have incorrect 0 placements, making them unrecognizable as standard digits (e.g., no clean loops/strokes), confirming the offset/shift logic fails for varied block positions or small pixel cols.
 * Test bg=3 is handled (borders are 3), and blocks extracted/grouped correctly (3 rows detected), but rendering fails due to pattern errors; if shift was fixed (e.g., adjust sh condition or modulo base), it might match expected digit forms like in train expected.

[2025-10-01 19:23:59] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear to interact or affect each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused only on patterns that hold across all cases without forcing explanations or assuming semantic meaning (e.g., no high-level puzzle interpretation). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., single-pixel objects without clear ties to transformations, or inconsistent color shifts) are excluded. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained consistently (e.g., exact pixel reduction varies slightly in one case), I note it as unknown rather than speculating. Connections are described in terms of properties like color, holes, bbox, pixels, and position.

1. **Small connected components (color C, holes=0, pixels <10, irregular/small bbox) ↔ Large solid 5x5 blocks (color C, holes=0, pixels=25, bbox size 5x5)**:
   - **Interaction**: Small components of color C consistently affect the corresponding large block of the same color C. The large block gains holes in the output (from holes=0 to holes ≥1). The number of added holes equals the number of distinct small connected components of color C in the input (e.g., separate bboxes count as separate components).
     - Consistent examples: Train 1 (Blue: 1 small → +1 hole; Pink: 2 small → +2 holes; Yellow: 1 small → +1 hole); Train 2 (Blue: 1 small → +1; Red: 3 small → +3; Green: 1 small → +1); Train 3 (Yellow: 1 small → +1; Green: 1 small → +1; Light Blue: 2 small → +2; Maroon: at least 1 small → +2, with hole count matching component-like pattern).
   - **Effect on pixels**: The large block's pixels decrease (from 25 to 18-20). The reduction approximates the total pixels summed from the small components of color C (exact match in Trains 1 and 2; off-by-1 in Train 3 for Maroon, unknown cause for discrepancy).
   - **Effect on position/bbox**: Bbox preserved in Trains 2 and 3; shifted leftward to standardized positions (e.g., x=1-5) in Train 1 when input large blocks are right-aligned, suggesting position → position interaction influenced by overall layout (e.g., left vs. right columns).
   - **Color preservation**: Color C unchanged for both small and large elements.
   - **Consistency note**: This interaction occurs for every large 5x5 block that has matching small components; no counterexamples across trains.

2. **Large background object (color BG, high holes ≥11, full/large bbox covering ~0-18/22 x 0-18, high pixels ≥247) ↔ Overall arrangement of shapes (positions of large 5x5 blocks and small components)**:
   - **Interaction**: The background consistently transforms based on the positions of other shapes (e.g., horizontal/vertical/grid layouts of large blocks and small components). Its bbox shrinks to a sub-region in the output (e.g., partial width/height coverage like [0,0,6,18] or [0,0,18,6]), and it gains small remnant components of color BG scattered in the output (e.g., pixels=1-7, small/irregular bboxes overlapping transformed large block areas).
     - Consistent examples: Train 1 (Maroon BG shrinks to left/partial height, spawns small Maroon p7/p4/p7/p1); Train 2 (Yellow BG shrinks to bottom/partial height, spawns small Yellow p1/p4/p7/p6/p1); Train 3 (Blue BG shrinks to top-left square, spawns small Blue p4/p6/p1/p5/p4/p1).
   - **Effect on holes**: Background holes reduce significantly (e.g., 13→3, 11→3, 17→4), likely due to interaction with shape positions "cutting out" areas.
   - **Effect on pixels**: Background pixels reduce sharply (e.g., 249→58, 247→58, 293→69), with the new total approximating coverage of the sub-bbox minus interacted areas (unknown exact mechanism for size variation, but consistently tied to layout).
   - **Effect on position/bbox**: New bbox aligns with the "active" layout area (e.g., left column in vertical Train 1; bottom in horizontal Train 2; top-left in grid Train 3), indicating position of shapes → background bbox transformation.
   - **Color preservation**: Color BG unchanged, and new small components adopt BG color (suggesting other small shapes' positions/colors may influence spawn, but unknown details).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has this background transformation tied to shape positions; small BG-colored components always appear in output near modified large blocks.

No other interactions (e.g., cross-color effects like Green → Blue, or hole count → color changes) are consistent across **all** trains—some appear in 1-2 examples but not every one, so excluded. Position effects (e.g., right-to-left shifts) are only consistent when tied to the large block interaction above. No forced connections for semantic shapes (e.g., tetromino types) as they are not reliably tied to properties like holes/pixels across all.

[2025-10-01 19:25:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background color, with the color value representing a specific digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), arranged in horizontal rows separated vertically by background space. The goal is to detect these blocks, group them by row, and render each as a predefined 5x5 binary pattern (1s as the digit's color, 0s as background) in a new output grid with background-filled borders and single-cell background separators between digits horizontally and full background rows between digit rows vertically.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input blocks are exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color; no partial or non-solid blocks should be extracted, and background is taken from top-left cell (often 0,1,3,4,8 in examples).
 * Digits supported are only 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 (no 0,5,7); if a color doesn't match, it should likely be skipped or treated as invalid, but all examples use valid colors.
 * Grouping blocks into rows: blocks in the same row have starting rows close enough (code uses <= last +5, which works for examples where rows are separated by exactly 1 bg row, but may need tightening if overlaps occur; sort by row then col).
 * Output structure: single top/bottom bg row, then for each group: 5 pattern rows + 1 full bg separator row (except after last group); horizontally, patterns start at col 1, spaced every 6 cols (5 pattern +1 bg separator), with left/right bg borders.
 * Patterns must be exactly binary 5x5 (1=on/pixel with digit color, 0=off/bg); the provided patterns are incorrect for several digits (e.g., 1,3), leading to mismatches—must reverse-engineer from expected outputs.
 * Subtle: Patterns are not symmetric or standard 7-segment; e.g., digit 1 is a thin vertical with serifs but wider base (row2/4: positions 1 and 5 on, 2-4 off; row3: 1-2 and 4-5 on), not the code's version. Digit 3 has a top bar, middle connections, but code's row2 is wrong (expected 1 0 0 0 1, not 1 0 1 0 1). No overlapping blocks or diagonal arrangements in examples. Background never appears inside blocks. Output dimensions must account for max blocks per row.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering uses the block's color for '1's in pattern, not a fixed color; separators are single bg cells/rows, not thicker. If no blocks, output minimal bg grid. All examples have even spacing, but test may vary row separation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The following functions from the attempt are helpful for extraction and rendering structure, but patterns need fixing:

```python
def get_background(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extract the background color from the top-left cell."""
    return grid[0][0] if grid and grid[0] else 0
```

    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples.

    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    bg = get_background(grid)
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0]) if grid[0] else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = grid[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if grid[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

```python
def group_into_rows(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Groups blocks into rows based on starting row proximity (within 5 units).
    Sorts groups by starting row and blocks within groups by starting column."""
    if not blocks:
        return []
    # Sort by starting row, then column
    sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b[0], b[1]))
    groups = []
    current_group = [sorted_blocks[0]]
    for block in sorted_blocks[1:]:
        if block[0] <= current_group[-1][0] + 5:
            current_group.append(block)
        else:
            # Sort current group by column
            current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = [block]
    # Sort last group by column
    current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
    groups.append(current_group)
    return groups
```

```python
def compute_output_dimensions(groups: List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Computes the height and width of the output grid based on number of groups and max blocks per group."""
    if not groups:
        return 1, 1
    num_groups = len(groups)
    max_blocks_per_row = max(len(group) for group in groups)
    height = 6 * num_groups + 1
    width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1
    return height, width
```

```python
def initialize_output_grid(height: int, width: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Initializes the output grid filled with background color."""
    return [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
```

```python
def render_digit_pattern(pattern: List[List[int]], color: int, bg: int, start_row: int, start_col: int, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """Renders a 5x5 digit pattern into the grid at the given position, using color for 1s and bg for 0s."""
    for k in range(5):
        for l in range(5):
            val = color if pattern[k][l] == 1 else bg
            grid[start_row + k][start_col + l] = val
```

The `get_digit_patterns` function is helpful in structure but broken due to incorrect patterns (do not reuse as-is; must update to match expected shapes from training outputs, e.g., for 1: row1 all1, row2 [1,0,0,0,1], row3 [1,1,0,1,1], row4 [1,0,0,0,1], row5 all1; similar fixes for 3 and others).

The main `program` function integrates these well but fails due to patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single previous attempt provided; it correctly extracts solid 5x5 blocks using color as digit identifier and groups them into rows based on vertical proximity, producing correct overall structure (spacing, borders, number of digits/rows).
 * What worked: Block detection accurately identifies all solid 5x5 regions (e.g., in train1 detects three single-digit rows for 1/6/4; train2 one row with 1/2/3; train3 two rows with 8+4 and 3+9); grouping correctly clusters horizontal rows without merging across separators; output dimensions and rendering placement (with bg separators) match expected layout exactly, including borders and no extra space.
 * What didn't work: Digit patterns are incorrect, causing shape mismatches in all training examples (e.g., train1 digit1 row2 generated 1 8 8 1 1 vs expected 1 8 8 8 1; row3 generated 1 1 8 1 1 vs expected 1 1 8 1 1—wait, row3 matches by coincidence but overall wrong; train2 digit1 row4 generated 1 4 4 1 1 vs expected 1 4 4 4 1; digit3 row2 generated 3 4 3 4 3 vs expected 3 4 3 4 3—wait, some partial matches but train2 row4 for1 wrong; train3 digit3 row9 (k=1) generated 3 1 3 1 3 vs expected 3 1 1 1 3; row10 (k=2) generated 3 1 1 1 3 vs expected 3 3 1 3 3; digit8 row4 generated 8 1 1 8 8 vs expected 8 8 8 1 8? Wait, generated row4 for8:8 8 8 1 8 matches expected; but for4 row3 generated 4 1 1 1 4 vs expected 4 1 1 1 4—matches, but code pattern leads to inconsistencies elsewhere).
 * All training examples marked INCORRECT due to pattern mismatches, even where some rows coincidentally match (e.g., some bars in 4/6/8/9 correct, but 1/2/3 fail consistently).
 * Function `get_digit_patterns` is broken and not helpful as-is (wrong shapes for 1,3 at minimum; do not reuse without correcting from expected outputs).
 * No unhelpful functions beyond that; extraction and grouping are essential and correct.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it uses the same flawed patterns from the attempt, leading to incorrect digit shapes (e.g., for digit4 in first row, row3 would render as 4 3 4 3 4 per code pattern [1,0,1,0,1], but expected likely 4 3 1 3 4 or similar based on train1's 4 pattern; for digit1 in second row, row4 would be 1 3 3 1 1 vs likely expected 1 3 3 3 1; for digit3 in third row? Wait, third row has6 and9, but if patterns wrong for6? Train1 6 mostly matched, but overall test inherits errors like train3's 3 mismatches).
 * The structure (three rows: 4+8, 2+1, 6+9; bg=3; proper spacing) makes sense and matches extraction/grouping success from training, but shapes are wrong (e.g., generated row5 for first row digit8:8 8 8 8 8? No, per code for8 row5 all1 ok, but row4 [1,1,1,0,1]->8 8 8 3 8 vs possibly expected different; unknown without explicit expected, but patterns cause visible differences like extra/missing pixels in 1/2/6).
 * To handle test, update patterns to match training expectations (e.g., derive full set: 1 as thin with base; 2 as curved top/mid/bottom; 3 as open right with connections; etc.); test has more digits per example, so ensure no col overflow.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background color, with each color value representing a specific digit (e.g., color 1 for digit 1, color 3 for digit 3), arranged potentially in rows. The task is to extract these blocks, group them into horizontal rows based on starting row proximity, and render each block as a predefined 5x5 binary pattern (using the block's color for '1' positions and background for '0' positions) in a new output grid with 1-cell borders, 1-cell spacing between digits in a row, and 1-cell horizontal separator lines between row groups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input blocks are strictly solid 5x5 regions of the same non-background color; any variation within the 5x5 (e.g., patterns instead of solid) would fail extraction, but examples suggest inputs use solid blocks.
 * Background color is always the top-left cell value; skip any block starting with background color.
 * Grouping into rows: Sort blocks by starting (row, col), then group consecutively if the next block's starting row <= last in group's starting row + 5 (allows slight vertical misalignment, but examples likely have exact row alignment); within each group, sort by starting column for left-to-right order.
 * Output layout: 1-cell top/bottom/full borders (all background); each digit group separated by 1 full background row; within a row, digits placed at column 1 + 6*index (1-cell left border + 5 pattern + 1 space); height = 6 * num_groups + 1 (5 pattern + 1 separator per group, + top border); width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1 (similar spacing + right border).
 * Digit patterns must exactly match expected shapes (binary 5x5 where 1= color, 0=bg), which appear to be custom pixel-art styles (not standard 7-segment); e.g., for digit 4 (color 4 on bg 1), expected is top/full, then right column + middle horizontal, bottom/full, but with specific off positions—current patterns mismatch this.
 * Only render if color is a supported digit (1-9, possibly 0); unsupported colors (e.g., 3,5,7,0) are silently skipped, leading to missing digits and incorrect width/dimensions.
 * Subtle: Patterns for supported digits like 4 and 2 do not match expected outputs (e.g., 4's middle rows have wrong '1' positions, making it look like a malformed 'H' instead of a '4'); 8's pattern coincidentally matches expected in some examples. Extraction scans every possible 5x5 top-left position without overlap handling, which works if blocks don't overlap but could miss if blocks are adjacent without gap. Output initializes fully with bg, so unpainted areas remain bg (correct for padding/missing digits).
 * All examples use odd dimensions (e.g., 13 cols for 2 digits, 19 for 3); borders are full bg rows/cols. No rotation, scaling, or non-5x5 objects.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```
(This is helpful and core for identifying solid digit blocks; correct assuming inputs are solid, but untested on patterned inputs—do not modify to handle patterns, as examples imply solid.)

```python
def group_into_rows(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """Groups blocks into rows based on starting row proximity (within 5 units).
    Sorts groups by starting row and blocks within groups by starting column."""
    if not blocks:

    # Sort by starting row, then column
    sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda b: (b[0], b[1]))
    groups = []
    current_group = [sorted_blocks[0]]
    for block in sorted_blocks[1:]:
        if block[0] <= current_group[-1][0] + 5:

    # Sort last group by column
    current_group.sort(key=lambda b: b[1])
    groups.append(current_group)
    return groups
```
(This is helpful for row grouping and sorting; the +5 tolerance handles minor misalignments, but may need tightening to exact row if over-grouping occurs—worked for train1.)

    height = 6 * num_groups + 1
    width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1
    return height, width
```
(This is helpful and correct for layout dimensions based on extracted groups.)

```python
def initialize_output_grid(height: int, width: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Initializes the output grid filled with background color."""
    return [[bg for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
```
(This is helpful and correct for bg-filled output.)

def render_digit_pattern(pattern: List[List[int]], color: int, bg: int, start_row: int, start_col: int, grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    """Renders a 5x5 digit pattern into the grid at the given position, using color for 1s and bg for 0s."""
    for k in range(5):
        for l in range(5):
            val = color if pattern[k][l] == 1 else bg
            grid[start_row + k][start_col + l] = val
```
(This is helpful for painting patterns, but depends on correct patterns; positioning assumes 0-indexed start after borders.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly extracted and grouped for training example 1 (full match, including layout and patterns).
 * Missed extraction or grouping of the third block (color 3 for digit 3) in training example 2, resulting in only two digits rendered (1 and 2) with width/dimensions for two blocks instead of three; generated row 2 of expected third digit area is all bg (padding), differing from expected patterned 3.
 * In training example 3, correctly extracted and grouped first row (8 and 4), but rendered incorrect pattern for 4 (e.g., row 3: 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected 4,1,1,1,4; row 4: 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected 4,4,1,4,4—looks like symmetric 'H' not '4'); pattern for 8 matched expected. For second row, missed extraction/grouping of first block (3), rendering only the 9 with single-block width, leaving left side all bg (1) vs. expected full row with 3 pattern (e.g., row 8 left: all 1 vs. expected 3,3,3,3,3).
 * get_digit_patterns() is broken/unhelpful: Contains incorrect binary patterns for supported digits (e.g., 4 mismatches expected shape; 2's bottom-left may mismatch); missing entries for 3,5,7,0 (causes skips/missing digits); do not reuse current version—must redefine with exact expected shapes (e.g., derive from train3's 3 and 4, train2's 3).
 * extract_solid_5x5_blocks is essential and mostly correct but may fail if input blocks have any non-solid cells (unknown if inputs are always solid, but implied yes); no overlap deduping, but examples likely non-overlapping.
 * group_into_rows worked for train1 and partial train3 but failed to include 3 in train3 second group (possibly due to row start > +5 from 9, or extraction miss—unknown reason).
 * compute_output_dimensions correct but inherits errors from missing groups (wrong width if digits skipped).
 * Overall, core extraction/layout understood but digit recognition/rendering flawed (wrong/missing patterns lead to visual mismatches); solid assumption may be correct but unverified on non-solid.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it renders six digits across three groups (first: 4-pattern and 8-pattern; second: 2-pattern and 1-pattern; third: 6-pattern and 9-pattern), with correct spacing/borders/bg=3, but uses the same flawed patterns as training (e.g., 4's shape is malformed as in train3: row 3 likely 4,1,4,1,4 vs. expected '4' like train3's 4,1,1,1,4; 2's pattern may mismatch expected curves). This results in inaccurate digit representations, and if test input has a 3/5/7/0, it would be missing (like train2/3), leading to incomplete rows/wrong widths. The output makes sense structurally (groups by row proximity, sorted left-right) but fails visually due to pattern errors—does not match expected if standards follow train examples (e.g., no solid rows where patterns should have gaps).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection of 5x5 "blocks" or pixel-art representations of digits (specifically 1,2,3,4,6,8,9) embedded in a larger grid, where the blocks are solid regions of a single non-background number surrounded by background (0 or other uniform value). The goal is to extract these blocks, group them logically (e.g., by approximate rows), sort them, and re-render them in a new bordered grid using predefined 5x5 patterns for each digit, separated by spacing and borders, effectively "decoding" or reformatting the input grid into a clean display of the digits.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be exactly 5x5 solid regions of the same non-background color/value, with no internal variations or extensions beyond 5x5; the detection scans the grid row-by-row and column-by-column, skipping background (bg) areas.
 * Grouping logic assumes vertical proximity: blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units (to handle adjacency without overlap), then sorted by starting row for groups and by starting column within groups; this handles multi-row arrangements but may fail if blocks overlap or are diagonally placed.
 * Output grid uses the input's background value (bg) for borders and spacers: full border rows/columns of bg, 5-unit spacing between blocks in a group (6 units total per block including gap), and 1-unit vertical spacers between groups (leading to height = 6 * num_groups + 1, but code has a bug in current_row +=5 then +1 only if not last).
 * Patterns are hardcoded 5x5 matrices for digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9, where the digit value fills "on" pixels and 0 is transparent (replaced by bg in output); missing patterns for 0,5,7 mean unsupported digits are skipped.
 * Subtlety: Patterns must exactly match expected digit shapes, which appear to be stylized (e.g., like LCD/segment displays in 5x5); mismatches in "on" pixel positions cause incorrect outputs, as seen in training examples.
 * Input grids have uniform bg (e.g., 8 in train1, 1 in train3, 3 in test), and blocks don't overlap; empty input returns single bg cell.
 * Easy to miss: Rendering overlays patterns starting at offsets (row 1, col 1 for first, +6 per block), but only if the block's color matches a pattern key; vertical spacing adds extra bg row between groups, but code's current_row logic skips the final spacer correctly only if adjusted.
 * Detection assumes rectangular grid with n rows, m cols; no handling for irregular shapes or non-integer blocks.
 * Output preserves digit values but embeds them in bg-bordered cells, with no rotation, scaling, or color changes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided program includes a main `program` function that handles detection, grouping, and rendering; no separate classes or helper functions are defined, but the block detection loop is useful as a core extractor. Below is an extracted/adapted version of the helpful block detection part (the rest of the program has pattern bugs):

```python
import typing as tp

def extract_blocks(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]]) -> tp.List[tp.Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Extracts 5x5 solid blocks as (start_row, start_col, color) tuples."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0]
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0]) if g else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_solid = True
            for k in range(5):
                if not is_solid:
                    break
                for l in range(5):
                    if g[i + k][j + l] != c:
                        is_solid = False
                        break
            if is_solid:
                blocks.append((i, j, c))
    return blocks
```

The grouping and rendering parts in the original are partially helpful but buggy (e.g., pattern mismatches, spacing). No types beyond List[List[int]] are used. The `patterns` dict is essential but currently incorrect for some digits (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (previous submission); it correctly detects 5x5 blocks and groups them by row proximity/sorting, which works for basic extraction and placement in train2 (full match).
 * Block detection loop successfully identifies solid regions and skips bg, handling empty grids; this is core and reusable.
 * Grouping by row (sort by start_row, merge if <=5 apart) and within-group col sort works for vertical/horizontal arrangements, as in train3 where two blocks per "row" are placed side-by-side.
 * Rendering creates correct overall structure: bg borders, 6-unit wide slots per block, vertical spacers; train2 passed fully, showing core layout logic is sound for some cases.
 * Patterns dict is unhelpful/inaccurate: for digit 1, generated has incorrect "on" positions (e.g., row2: 1 at col2,8s elsewhere vs. expected more centered/top-heavy); for 6, row4 has 6 at col2,8,9-11 vs. expected; for 4 in train1/3, mismatches like row3 all 8s in center vs. expected partial 4s; for 3 in train3, row2/3 have wrong 3 placements (e.g., row3: 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,3,1,3? wait, expected has variations); for 9 similar issues in row3/4. These cause train1 and train3 to fail despite correct positions.
 * Sorting works (blocks by row then col), but assumes no overlaps/duplicates; didn't handle pattern transparency correctly (0s become bg, but positions wrong).
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the full `program` is broken due to pattern errors; the `extract_blocks` adaptation above is helpful and should be kept, while patterns need full rewrite from expected outputs.
 * Train1 mismatches: 1's pattern has extra 1s in wrong spots (e.g., row3 col3=1 vs. expected 8?); 6's row2/4 off; 4's row2/3/4/5 have misplaced 4s (e.g., row5 all 4s bottom vs. expected partial).
 * Train3 mismatches: 8/4 placement correct but patterns slightly off (minor for 8/4? but 4 in row3/4 wrong); 3's row2=3,1,3,1,3? generated has 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,1,1,1,3 (wait, similar but row3 generated 3,1,1,1,3 vs. expected 3,3,1,3,3; row4 similar); 9's row2 generated 9,1,9,1,9 vs. expected 9,1,9,1,9 (match?) but row3 9,1,1,9,9 vs. expected 9,1,1,9,9 (match) wait, actual diffs in row3/4 for 3/9 as noted.
 * Overall, detection/grouping solid (6/10 on that), rendering patterns fail (0/10), leading to partial success.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense: it detects and places two blocks per group (4 and 8 in row-group1, 2 and 1 in group2, 6 and 9 in group3), with bg=3 borders/spacers, correct 13-col width (6*2 +1 per group) and ~19-row height (6*3 +1, but with internal 5+1=6 per group); layout positions blocks at expected offsets (e.g., first group rows 1-5 cols1-5 for 4, 7-11 for 8).
 * However, it does not look fully correct due to pattern mismatches similar to training: for 4 (top-left), row3 has 4,3,3,3,4,4? wait generated row3: [3,4,3,3,3,4,3,...] which seems off vs. likely expected more structured (from train1's 4 pattern); for 8, row3/4 have 8,3,3,8,8 which may match a partial but row5 all 8s bottom ok?; for 2 (group2 left), row3:2,3,3,2,2 ok? but row4:2,3,2,3,2 vs. expected from patterns likely 2,0,2,0,2 filled; for 1 right of it, row4:1,3,3,3,1 wrong (overly sparse); for 6/9 in group3, similar issues (e.g., 6 row4:6,3,6,6,6 vs. expected from train1 6,8,6,6,6 filled). It extracts correctly but renders wrong shapes, so output is structurally right but visually distorted digits; to fix, derive exact patterns from all expected outputs (e.g., aggregate train1/3 diffs to correct dict). Unknown why some positions flip 3/bg, but likely pattern 0 placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify large 5x5 solid-color blocks (non-background) as "digits" or objects, grouping them into visual rows, and then generating a new formatted grid where each block is rendered as a 5x5 binary pattern (using the block's color for 1s and background for 0s) derived from the positions of smaller, uncovered pixels of the same color elsewhere in the input grid. The output grid arranges these patterns in rows separated by background lines, with column spacing, effectively "decoding" or simplifying the input into a cleaner digit-like representation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (grid[0][0]), and all solid 5x5 blocks must be uniformly non-background; overlapping or partial blocks are ignored.
 * Blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units of each other; within groups, sort by starting column for left-to-right order.
 * Output dimensions: height = 6 * num_groups + 1 (for separators), width = 6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1; borders and separators are background color, patterns placed at offsets like row 1,7,13,... and col 1,7,13,...
 * Patterns start as all 1s (full block), but are modified to 0s based on "small pixels" (same-color cells not covered by any 5x5 block); these small pixels are grouped by their row, sorted, and mapped to pattern rows (ii+1), with column offsets computed using modulo 5, a shift (sh = 0 if block_col1 %5 ==3 else -1), and relative to the block's starting column (sc).
 * Covered cells: All cells within any detected 5x5 block are marked covered globally, so small pixels are only non-block remnants of the color.
 * Subtle shift logic: The shift (sh) depends on the block's 1-based starting column modulo 5 (specifically if ==3, sh=0 else -1), and offsets are (col1 %5 + sh +5)%5, where col1 is 1-based small pixel column; multiple small pixels per row create multiple 0s.
 * Easy to miss: Small pixels can be anywhere (not just near the block), but mapping assumes they represent "features" to subtract from the full 5x5; if no small pixels, pattern is all 1s (solid).
 * Output rendering: Patterns use the block's color for 1s, bg for 0s; entire output bordered by bg, with vertical/horizontal separators of bg.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns [[bg]] or [[0]]; no blocks means [[bg]]; patterns clipped if >4 rows of small pixels (pat_r >4 skipped).
 * Global considerations: Colors are integers (e.g., 1=bg in some, 3 in test); assume square-ish input but handle rectangular; no rotation or scaling, exact 5x5 detection.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 and 2: Correct, indicating successful block extraction, row grouping, output sizing, initialization, and basic rendering; pattern computation worked for those cases (likely simpler small pixel distributions).
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated patterns for first block (left, color 8) show full top/bottom rows but incorrect middle: row3 has 1,1,1,8,8,8 vs expected 1,8,1,1,8,8; row4 same issue 1,1,1,8,8,8 vs 1,8,1,1,8,8; row5 1,8,8,1,8,8 vs 1,8,8,8,1,8—suggests offset/shift logic or small pixel mapping is misaligned (possibly wrong modulo or shift application, leading to too many 1s in left columns).
 * For second block in train 3 (color 4): Similar misalignment, row3 4,1,4,1,4,1 (expected same, but wait no—generated matches expected for this? Wait, generated row3 right:4,1,4,1,4,1 expected same; but row5:4,4,1,4,4,1 expected same; actually upon close look, the provided generated and expected differ mainly in left block, right seems closer but row4 right generated 4,1,1,1,4,1 expected same—wait, they match for right? No, the paste shows generated row4 right:4,1,1,1,4,1 expected same; but left differs. Overall, pattern for left block wrong, right partially ok, but code treats symmetrically so likely global shift bug.
 * Covered set computation works (global across all blocks), as it prevents using block cells as small pixels.
 * Pattern computation function is partially broken: Starts with all 1s, groups small by row, maps to pat_r=ii+1, but offset calc uses block_col1 = sc +1 (1-based), sh=0 if %5==3 else -1, then for each small col: raw=col1%5, ll=(raw+sh+5)%5, set pat[pat_r][ll]=0; this seems intended to align small pixels relative to block position, but in train3 it over-sets or mis-shifts 0s, leaving extra 1s in early columns (e.g., positions 1-2 stay 1 instead of 0).
 * Grouping and rendering positions correct (separators at every 6 rows/cols, starting at 1).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, but compute_pattern inline in main is messy/incomplete in the code snippet (comments note errors like missing sc param).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a 19-row grid (3 groups *6 +1=19, correct sizing for 3 rows of 2 digits each), with bg=3 borders/separators, and patterns for colors 4/8 (first row), 2/1 (second), 6/9 (third), but the patterns appear mangled similar to train3 errors.
 * First group (rows 2-6): Left (4) has row3:3,3,3,4,4,4 (too many left 3s/bg, expected more 0s carved out); row4:3,4,3,4,4,4 (misaligned 0s); row5:3,4,3,3,4,4 (extra bg in col3); right (8) row3:8,8,3,3,3,3 (too many right bg, unlike expected digit shapes).
 * Second group (rows 8-12): Left (2) row9:2,2,3,3,2,2? Wait, row8 is top full, row9:2,3,3,3,2,2? No—row9:3,2,3,3,2,2,3 (scattered); row10:3,2,2,3,2,2,3 (clumped but wrong positions); looks like shift misapplies, creating non-digit-like blobs instead of clear 2/1 shapes.
 * Third group (rows 14-18): Similar issues, left (6) row15:6,3,6,6,6 (gap in col2); row16:6,6,3,3,6 (gaps in 3-4); right (9) row15:9,3,9,9,9 (gap col2); overall, patterns have incorrect 0 placements, making them unrecognizable as standard digits (e.g., no clean loops/strokes), confirming the offset/shift logic fails for varied block positions or small pixel cols.
 * Test bg=3 is handled (borders are 3), and blocks extracted/grouped correctly (3 rows detected), but rendering fails due to pattern errors; if shift was fixed (e.g., adjust sh condition or modulo base), it might match expected digit forms like in train expected.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties and components that appear to interact or affect each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). I focused only on patterns that hold across all cases without forcing explanations or assuming semantic meaning (e.g., no high-level puzzle interpretation). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., single-pixel objects without clear ties to transformations, or inconsistent color shifts) are excluded. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained consistently (e.g., exact pixel reduction varies slightly in one case), I note it as unknown rather than speculating. Connections are described in terms of properties like color, holes, bbox, pixels, and position.

1. **Small connected components (color C, holes=0, pixels <10, irregular/small bbox) ↔ Large solid 5x5 blocks (color C, holes=0, pixels=25, bbox size 5x5)**:
   - **Interaction**: Small components of color C consistently affect the corresponding large block of the same color C. The large block gains holes in the output (from holes=0 to holes ≥1). The number of added holes equals the number of distinct small connected components of color C in the input (e.g., separate bboxes count as separate components).
     - Consistent examples: Train 1 (Blue: 1 small → +1 hole; Pink: 2 small → +2 holes; Yellow: 1 small → +1 hole); Train 2 (Blue: 1 small → +1; Red: 3 small → +3; Green: 1 small → +1); Train 3 (Yellow: 1 small → +1; Green: 1 small → +1; Light Blue: 2 small → +2; Maroon: at least 1 small → +2, with hole count matching component-like pattern).
   - **Effect on pixels**: The large block's pixels decrease (from 25 to 18-20). The reduction approximates the total pixels summed from the small components of color C (exact match in Trains 1 and 2; off-by-1 in Train 3 for Maroon, unknown cause for discrepancy).
   - **Effect on position/bbox**: Bbox preserved in Trains 2 and 3; shifted leftward to standardized positions (e.g., x=1-5) in Train 1 when input large blocks are right-aligned, suggesting position → position interaction influenced by overall layout (e.g., left vs. right columns).
   - **Color preservation**: Color C unchanged for both small and large elements.
   - **Consistency note**: This interaction occurs for every large 5x5 block that has matching small components; no counterexamples across trains.

2. **Large background object (color BG, high holes ≥11, full/large bbox covering ~0-18/22 x 0-18, high pixels ≥247) ↔ Overall arrangement of shapes (positions of large 5x5 blocks and small components)**:
   - **Interaction**: The background consistently transforms based on the positions of other shapes (e.g., horizontal/vertical/grid layouts of large blocks and small components). Its bbox shrinks to a sub-region in the output (e.g., partial width/height coverage like [0,0,6,18] or [0,0,18,6]), and it gains small remnant components of color BG scattered in the output (e.g., pixels=1-7, small/irregular bboxes overlapping transformed large block areas).
     - Consistent examples: Train 1 (Maroon BG shrinks to left/partial height, spawns small Maroon p7/p4/p7/p1); Train 2 (Yellow BG shrinks to bottom/partial height, spawns small Yellow p1/p4/p7/p6/p1); Train 3 (Blue BG shrinks to top-left square, spawns small Blue p4/p6/p1/p5/p4/p1).
   - **Effect on holes**: Background holes reduce significantly (e.g., 13→3, 11→3, 17→4), likely due to interaction with shape positions "cutting out" areas.
   - **Effect on pixels**: Background pixels reduce sharply (e.g., 249→58, 247→58, 293→69), with the new total approximating coverage of the sub-bbox minus interacted areas (unknown exact mechanism for size variation, but consistently tied to layout).
   - **Effect on position/bbox**: New bbox aligns with the "active" layout area (e.g., left column in vertical Train 1; bottom in horizontal Train 2; top-left in grid Train 3), indicating position of shapes → background bbox transformation.
   - **Color preservation**: Color BG unchanged, and new small components adopt BG color (suggesting other small shapes' positions/colors may influence spawn, but unknown details).
   - **Consistency note**: Every train has this background transformation tied to shape positions; small BG-colored components always appear in output near modified large blocks.

No other interactions (e.g., cross-color effects like Green → Blue, or hole count → color changes) are consistent across **all** trains—some appear in 1-2 examples but not every one, so excluded. Position effects (e.g., right-to-left shifts) are only consistent when tied to the large block interaction above. No forced connections for semantic shapes (e.g., tetromino types) as they are not reliably tied to properties like holes/pixels across all.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 19:35:24] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle requires extracting solid 5x5 non-background blocks from an input grid, grouping them into horizontal rows based on proximity, computing binary digit-like patterns for each block by analyzing surrounding "small" pixels or carvings not covered by other blocks, and rendering these patterns into a larger output grid with spacing and background fill, effectively decoding or visualizing the blocks as digits (e.g., 0-9 representations).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always the top-left cell (grid[0][0]), and all blocks must be solid 5x5 regions of the same non-background color; skip any 5x5 that includes background or varies in color.
 * Blocks are grouped into "rows" if their starting rows are within 5 units of each other; sort groups by starting row and blocks within groups by starting column to maintain left-to-right order.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as (6 * num_groups + 1) height and (6 * max_blocks_per_row + 1) width to allow 5x5 patterns plus 1-unit separators/borders filled with background.
 * Pattern computation is the trickiest part: for each block, identify "small" pixels of the same color not covered by any other 5x5 block; filter out special cases like full rows immediately below the block (at sr+5); map these small pixels to a 5x5 binary grid by relative columns modulo 5, setting 1s to color and 0s to background, with special handling for cases with exactly 2 unique rows (e.g., setting mid or specific positions to 0 based on above/below positioning).
 * If no small pixels after filtering, default to a full solid 5x5 pattern (all 1s).
 * Rendering places patterns starting at row 1 + 6*(group_index) and column 1 + 6*(block_index_in_group), ensuring borders and separators are background.
 * Subtlety: The "carving" or pattern logic assumes small pixels indicate "holes" or absences in a digit shape, but it can over-simplify (e.g., modulo 5 column mapping may alias positions incorrectly if small pixels span >5 columns); special skip for row sr+5 avoids double-counting horizontal extensions.
 * Easy to miss: Proximity grouping uses <= current_group[-1][0] + 5, which may merge unintended blocks if rows are exactly 6 apart; pattern assumes min_col alignment +1 offset, which could shift patterns if small pixels are offset; for k=2 rows, above/below logic inverts handling (e.g., set mid hole if above and len(sets1)>=2).
 * All considerations: Handle empty grids by returning [[bg]]; ensure output is always rectangular; patterns are binary (1=color, 0=bg), not copying the original block directly; the modulo 5 and relative positioning try to normalize to digit widths but may fail on wide or irregular small pixel distributions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed all three training examples, correctly extracting blocks, grouping them, and rendering patterned outputs that match expected digit visualizations.
 * The block extraction and grouping logic worked well for training cases, accurately identifying solid 5x5 regions and maintaining row/column order without merging unrelated groups.
 * Pattern computation worked for training but relied on heuristics (e.g., modulo 5, special k=2 handling) that may not generalize; defaults to full solid if no small pixels, which was correct for simple cases.
 * Output grid initialization and rendering (with 6-unit spacing) correctly produced bordered, separated patterns for training inputs.
 * However, the special skip for sr+5 full rows prevented over-carving in training but might miss vertical extensions in other cases.
 * The relative column mapping (cc - min_col + 1) % 5 in pattern computation introduced potential aliasing, but it didn't break training examples.
 * Overall, core pipeline (extract -> group -> pattern -> render) demonstrates understanding, but compute_pattern is overcomplicated and may fail on irregular small pixel distributions (e.g., non-modulo aligned or >2 rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 19x13 grid (3 groups * 6 +1 height, 2 blocks max *6 +1 width) with background 3, rendering three rows of two 5x5 patterns each: first row (colors 4 and 8) shows mostly solid with some internal 3s (holes) resembling digits like '8' (left) and '0' or '8' (right); second row (2 and 1) has patterns with holes suggesting '4' and '7' or similar; third row (6 and 9) looks like '0' and '8' with holes.
 * The output makes partial sense as a digit rendering (e.g., consistent borders/separators, non-overlapping patterns), but the specific hole placements (e.g., in first row left: holes at [2,1],[3,2],[4,2]; right: minimal holes) do not clearly match standard 7-segment or pixel-digit shapes for expected values— it seems over-carved or misaligned, possibly due to small pixel mapping errors (e.g., modulo 5 aliasing wide distributions or incorrect k=2 mid-hole logic).
 * Compared to expected (mentally simulating rules on test input, assuming test has three horizontal pairs of 5x5 solids with surrounding pixels indicating digits like 48 / 21 / 69 or similar), the patterns are denser than typical (fewer 0s/holes), suggesting the filtering or default solid fallback is triggering too often; for example, if small pixels are skipped entirely, it defaults to full solids, but output has some holes, so partial computation happened but incorrectly (e.g., wrong row mapping for unique_rows).
 * The output is different from expected in subtlety: holes are present but in non-standard positions (e.g., no clear top/bottom bars for digits), indicating compute_pattern's row_to_llset and pat[pat_idx] setting isn't aligning small pixels to correct digit rows/columns—likely off-by-1 in rel = cc - min_col +1 or %5 wrapping.
 * It's okay to note: unknown why k=2 special case (if above/below) sets pat[3][mid] or pat[3][ll] specifically to row 3 (middle), as it may not match all digit topologies; this could be why test patterns look asymmetric.
