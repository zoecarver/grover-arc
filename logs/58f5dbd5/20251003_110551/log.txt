=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:05:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:14:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain multiple 5x5 solid uniform-color blocks (non-background) arranged in horizontal layers, each representing a digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), and the goal is to generate an output grid that replaces each solid block with its corresponding 5x5 patterned pixel-art representation of the digit, arranged in the same relative positions but embedded in a larger grid with background borders, row separators, and column separators between digits in the same layer. The output preserves the layered structure, with each layer of digits separated vertically by a full background row, and digits within a layer separated horizontally by a single background column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is always the value at g[0][0] and fills all non-pattern areas, including full borders around the entire output, single-column separators between digits in the same row/layer, and full-row separators (height 1) between layers.
 * Solid blocks are exactly 5x5 uniform non-background pixels; they must be detected precisely without overlapping detection issues, and only these are replaced—any non-solid or background areas remain unchanged in concept but are reconstructed in the output layout.
 * Blocks are grouped into "layers" if their starting rows differ by less than 5 (indicating horizontal alignment/overlap in the same "row" of the puzzle), and within each layer, blocks are sorted left-to-right by starting column.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (accounting for 5 pattern rows + 1 separator per layer, plus top/bottom borders), width = 6 * max_digits_per_layer + 1 (5 pattern cols + 1 separator per digit, plus left/right borders); patterns start at offsets (1,1) per block with incremental positioning.
 * Digit patterns are fixed 5x5 binary masks (1=on/pixel color, 0=off/background), but the color of the digit is the uniform color of the detected solid block (c), not a fixed value—off pixels use b.
 * No support for digits 0,5,7 (masks only for 1,2,3,4,6,8,9); unknown digits default to solid, but this may cause issues if other digits appear.
 * Input grids have top/bottom/middle full background rows separating layers, and blocks do not overlap between layers.
 * Subtle: Patterns must exactly match expected pixel-art shapes (e.g., '1' is a vertical bar with serifs or specific offsets, not symmetric); mismatches in mask definitions lead to pixel-level differences.
 * If no blocks, output should be a background-filled grid of original size, but in practice, examples always have blocks.
 * Horizontal positioning in output assumes sorted left-to-right, with separators only between digits (no leading/trailing extras beyond borders).
 * Vertical positioning starts at row 1 for first layer, increments by 6 per layer (5 pattern +1 sep).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection of 5x5 solid blocks via find_solid_blocks worked correctly, as it identified the right positions and colors for all blocks in training examples (no missed or false positives noted).
 * Grouping into horizontal layers via group_blocks worked well, correctly separating layers (e.g., in example 1, three separate layers for 1,6,4; in example 3, three layers with two digits each).
 * Output layout construction (borders, separators, positioning) was mostly correct: proper height/width calc, vertical stacking with 6-row increments, horizontal sorting and 6-col increments per digit, leading to correct overall structure and spacing in all examples.
 * Training example 2 was fully correct, indicating the block detection, grouping, and layout handle simple cases (likely single-layer or matching patterns) perfectly.
 * digit_masks were fundamentally incorrect, causing pixel-level mismatches in patterns: e.g., in training 1, '1' generated had wide base and misplaced pixels (row2:1,0,0,1,1 vs expected narrow right:0,0,0,0,1; row3:1,1,0,1,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1; row4:1,0,0,0,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1), '6' had wrong curve (row4:1,0,1,1,1 vs expected 1,0,1,0,1?), '4' mismatched crossbar/legs; similar issues in training 3 for '8' (row4:1,1,1,0,1 vs expected ?), '4' legs wrong, '3' curve off (row3:1,1,0,0,1 vs 1,0,0,0,1?), '9' top/bottom wrong.
 * get_digit_pattern is helpful but broken due to bad masks; it correctly applies c/b but uses wrong binary shapes, leading to all pattern failures except possibly '2' or cases where mask accidentally matched.
 * program main function is mostly solid (handles empty grid, iterates groups correctly) but inherits mask errors; no issues with background filling or size.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (find_solid_blocks, group_blocks, get_digit_pattern) are relevant, though masks need full correction from expected patterns.
 * Subtle miss: Assumes digit identity from block color (c as key), which works if colors map uniquely to digits, but patterns must be standard 7-segment-like or puzzle-specific (inferred from diffs: asymmetric, like LCD/LED digits).
 * Training 1 and 3 failed entirely due to pattern mismatches, not layout—e.g., train1 generated symmetric/wrong '1' (left-heavy), train3 swapped pixels in '4' row3 (1,1,4,1,4 vs expected 1,0,0,0,1? wait, actually from diff: generated row3 for first '4':4,1,4,1,4 but expected 4,1,1,1,4? No, looking closely: mismatches are specific pixel flips, e.g., train3 '4' row3 generated [4,1,1,1,4,1] wait no, the shown is per row but aggregated.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_solid_blocks serves as essential for identifying "objects" (blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same pattern errors from training 1/3: e.g., top layer '4' and '8' show wide/misplaced pixels (row2 for '4':[4,3,3,3,4,3] wait, no—shown as [3,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,3] for row1, but row3:[3,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,3,3,8,8,3] indicates wrong mask for '4' (expected narrow or specific from train3 '4'), '8' has off-curve; middle layer '2' and '1' mismatch (row3 for '2':[2,3,3,2,2,3] vs likely expected curved top; '1' row4:[1,3,3,3,1,3] wrong stem); bottom '6' and '9' have similar curve/flip errors as train1 '6'.
 * It correctly detects and places 6 blocks in 3 layers (two per layer, like train3), with proper borders/separators and background 3, but patterns are invalid (e.g., '1' not narrow vertical, '9' row4:[9,9,3,9,9,3] vs expected from train3 [9,1,1,9,9,1] adjusted).
 * Test input has layers separated by background rows (rows 0,6,12 full 3; blocks at rows1-5,7-11,13-17), solid 5x5 of colors 4/8 top, 2/1 middle, 6/9 bottom—output structure matches this, but patterns do not, so it fails like train1/3.
 * To fix for test, correct all masks to match inferred expected (e.g., '1' right-aligned stem, '4' open top with cross, etc.); without this, test will always mismatch pixel-by-pixel.

[2025-10-03 11:14:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:28:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid consists of isolated 5x5 solid-colored blocks separated by background (bg) rows/columns, and the goal is to produce an output grid that preserves the overall structure (including bg separators and borders) but transforms each solid 5x5 block into a specific non-solid pattern using the block's color and bg to form shapes (likely letters or symbols). The previous program correctly detects and locates the blocks while copying the grid structure but fails by filling blocks solidly instead of applying the required patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids contain uniform 5x5 solid blocks of a single color (c != bg), separated by single rows/columns of bg; blocks do not overlap and are axis-aligned.
 * Output must retain the full grid dimensions and positions, including all bg borders and separators between blocks (no true compression; separators become full bg rows/columns in output).
 * Each 5x5 block must be transformed from solid c to a unique pattern where some cells remain c and others revert to bg, forming distinct shapes; patterns vary by block position/order/color and are not solid or simple frames.
 * Bg is consistently the corner value (e.g., 8, 4, 1, 3 across examples); blocks are only detected if entirely uniform and != bg.
 * Patterns appear to represent letters/symbols in a 5x5 dot-matrix style (e.g., 'O'-like ring, 'C'-like curve, 'H'-like structure, 'E'-like, 'P'-like); the rule for generating patterns per block is unknown but position-dependent (e.g., first block in ex1 is ring-shaped for color 1, second is 'C'-shaped for 6).
 * Subtle: Patterns use bg to "carve out" shapes inside the 5x5, so overrides must selectively set cells to c or bg; simple frames or solids fail.
 * Separators (1-row/column bg gaps) must be preserved as full bg lines in output; no merging or removal.
 * Grids can be vertical stacks (ex1, ex3 partial), horizontal (ex2, ex3 partial), or mixed; blocks may share rows/columns if adjacent but are isolated by bg.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no blocks means full bg grid; blocks at edges include outer bg borders.
 * Unknown subtlety: Exact pattern rule (e.g., hardcoded per position, derived from color, or puzzle-specific sequence) is not implemented; attempting solids or basic frames mismatches all examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the top-left value, consistent across examples; useful for distinguishing blocks.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[dict]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(h - 4):
        for j in range(w - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_block = True
            for di in range(5):
                for dj in range(5):
                    if g[i + di][j + dj] != c:
                        is_block = False
                        break
                if not is_block:
                    break
            if is_block:
                blocks.append({'r': i, 'c': j, 'color': c})
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects all 5x5 uniform solid blocks != bg, returning their positions and colors; essential for identifying what to transform; works correctly in all examples as positions match expected outputs.)

```python
def build_map(starts: List[int], size: int) -> List[int]:
    if not starts:
        return list(range(size))  # fallback
    out_map = []
    first_start = starts[0]
    if first_start > 0:
        out_map.append(0)
    prev_end = first_start - 1
    for idx, s in enumerate(starts):
        if idx > 0 and s > starts[idx - 1] + 5:
            out_map.append(starts[idx - 1] + 5)
        for k in range(5):
            out_map.append(s + k)
        prev_end = s + 4
    if prev_end < size - 1:
        out_map.append(prev_end + 1)
    return out_map
```
(This generates a row/column index map that includes block positions + preceding bg (top/borders) + inter-block separators + trailing bg; in practice for 1-row gaps, it includes all indices, preserving full structure; helpful for structured copying but overkill if output mirrors input dimensions exactly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly detects all 5x5 solid blocks via find_blocks (positions and colors match expected block locations in all training examples).
 * Preserves overall grid structure, dimensions, bg borders, and single-row/column separators between blocks (e.g., ex1 outputs 19 rows with bg rows at 1,7,13 positions; ex2 keeps horizontal separators; ex3 handles mixed vertical/horizontal).
 * build_map correctly includes all necessary rows/columns without omission or extra compression, leading to out being a full-sized copy of input before overrides.
 * Fails to transform blocks: overrides 5x5 areas with solid color c instead of patterns, resulting in uniform fills (e.g., ex1 top block all 1s vs. expected ring pattern with 8s inside; ex2 color 1 all 1s vs. expected 'E'-like with 4s carved out).
 * In ex1: generated solid 5x5 blocks for colors 1,6,4 separated by bg rows, but expected has unique patterns (1: ring/diamond; 6: asymmetric curve like 'C'; 4: cross like 'H' or 'X' variant); difference is all internal cells solid vs. selective bg carving.
 * In ex2: generated solid horizontal 5x5 for 1,2,3 with bg=4 separators, but expected patterns (1: 'E'-like with bg fills; 2: zigzag or 'Z'; 3: irregular like 'F'); difference unknown rule for pattern shapes but clearly not solid.
 * In ex3: generated solid pairs (upper:8 and4; lower:3 and9) with bg=1, but expected patterns (8: 'P'-like; 4: filled with bg cross; 3: curve; 9: symmetric); difference in internal structure, with generated ignoring pattern variety.
 * get_bg works perfectly (correctly IDs 8,4,1,3).
 * The override loop in program() is broken/not helpful: sets entire 5x5 to c (solid), but needs pattern-specific logic (e.g., if/then for positions); commented frame example is unhelpful/wrong as it doesn't match any expected.
 * Initial fill out[i_out][j_out] = g[i_in][j_in] copies input solids correctly but is redundant since override wipes it; unhelpful for transformation.
 * No pattern generation logic implemented, leading to all training failures; core issue is assuming solid output blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows solid 5x5 blocks (colors 4 upper-left, 8 upper-right, 2 lower-left, 1 lower-middle? Wait, listing suggests vertical stack of horizontals: upper pair 4/8, mid bg, lower pair 2/1, then another bg, then 6/9 pair) separated by bg=3 rows, preserving structure like training.
 * Does not look correct: Based on training, blocks should have unique internal patterns (e.g., carved bg shapes forming letters/symbols) instead of solids; e.g., upper 4 block all 4s vs. likely a specific shape like in ex1's 4 ('H'-like); same for 8,2,1,6,9.
 * Missing transformation: All blocks uniform, ignoring pattern rule; if test follows training, output should have bg-carved shapes in each 5x5 (e.g., curves, rings, crosses), making solids visibly wrong.
 * Structure matches expected style (full grid with separators), but content fails similarly to training (solids vs. patterns).

[2025-10-03 11:28:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid consists of isolated 5x5 solid-colored blocks separated by background (bg) rows/columns, and the goal is to produce an output grid that preserves the overall structure (including bg separators and borders) but transforms each solid 5x5 block into a specific non-solid pattern using the block's color and bg to form shapes (likely letters or symbols). The previous program correctly detects and locates the blocks while copying the grid structure but fails by filling blocks solidly instead of applying the required patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids contain uniform 5x5 solid blocks of a single color (c != bg), separated by single rows/columns of bg; blocks do not overlap and are axis-aligned.
 * Output must retain the full grid dimensions and positions, including all bg borders and separators between blocks (no true compression; separators become full bg rows/columns in output).
 * Each 5x5 block must be transformed from solid c to a unique pattern where some cells remain c and others revert to bg, forming distinct shapes; patterns vary by block position/order/color and are not solid or simple frames.
 * Bg is consistently the corner value (e.g., 8, 4, 1, 3 across examples); blocks are only detected if entirely uniform and != bg.
 * Patterns appear to represent letters/symbols in a 5x5 dot-matrix style (e.g., 'O'-like ring, 'C'-like curve, 'H'-like structure, 'E'-like, 'P'-like); the rule for generating patterns per block is unknown but position-dependent (e.g., first block in ex1 is ring-shaped for color 1, second is 'C'-shaped for 6).
 * Subtle: Patterns use bg to "carve out" shapes inside the 5x5, so overrides must selectively set cells to c or bg; simple frames or solids fail.
 * Separators (1-row/column bg gaps) must be preserved as full bg lines in output; no merging or removal.
 * Grids can be vertical stacks (ex1, ex3 partial), horizontal (ex2, ex3 partial), or mixed; blocks may share rows/columns if adjacent but are isolated by bg.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no blocks means full bg grid; blocks at edges include outer bg borders.
 * Unknown subtlety: Exact pattern rule (e.g., hardcoded per position, derived from color, or puzzle-specific sequence) is not implemented; attempting solids or basic frames mismatches all examples.

                continue
            is_block = True
            for di in range(5):
                for dj in range(5):
                    if g[i + di][j + dj] != c:
                        is_block = False
                        break
                if not is_block:
                    break
            if is_block:
                blocks.append({'r': i, 'c': j, 'color': c})
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects all 5x5 uniform solid blocks != bg, returning their positions and colors; essential for identifying what to transform; works correctly in all examples as positions match expected outputs.)

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain multiple 5x5 solid uniform-color blocks (non-background) arranged in horizontal layers, each representing a digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), and the goal is to generate an output grid that replaces each solid block with its corresponding 5x5 patterned pixel-art representation of the digit, arranged in the same relative positions but embedded in a larger grid with background borders, row separators, and column separators between digits in the same layer. The output preserves the layered structure, with each layer of digits separated vertically by a full background row, and digits within a layer separated horizontally by a single background column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is always the value at g[0][0] and fills all non-pattern areas, including full borders around the entire output, single-column separators between digits in the same row/layer, and full-row separators (height 1) between layers.
 * Solid blocks are exactly 5x5 uniform non-background pixels; they must be detected precisely without overlapping detection issues, and only these are replaced—any non-solid or background areas remain unchanged in concept but are reconstructed in the output layout.
 * Blocks are grouped into "layers" if their starting rows differ by less than 5 (indicating horizontal alignment/overlap in the same "row" of the puzzle), and within each layer, blocks are sorted left-to-right by starting column.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (accounting for 5 pattern rows + 1 separator per layer, plus top/bottom borders), width = 6 * max_digits_per_layer + 1 (5 pattern cols + 1 separator per digit, plus left/right borders); patterns start at offsets (1,1) per block with incremental positioning.
 * Digit patterns are fixed 5x5 binary masks (1=on/pixel color, 0=off/background), but the color of the digit is the uniform color of the detected solid block (c), not a fixed value—off pixels use b.
 * No support for digits 0,5,7 (masks only for 1,2,3,4,6,8,9); unknown digits default to solid, but this may cause issues if other digits appear.
 * Input grids have top/bottom/middle full background rows separating layers, and blocks do not overlap between layers.
 * Subtle: Patterns must exactly match expected pixel-art shapes (e.g., '1' is a vertical bar with serifs or specific offsets, not symmetric); mismatches in mask definitions lead to pixel-level differences.
 * If no blocks, output should be a background-filled grid of original size, but in practice, examples always have blocks.
 * Horizontal positioning in output assumes sorted left-to-right, with separators only between digits (no leading/trailing extras beyond borders).
 * Vertical positioning starts at row 1 for first layer, increments by 6 per layer (5 pattern +1 sep).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection of 5x5 solid blocks via find_solid_blocks worked correctly, as it identified the right positions and colors for all blocks in training examples (no missed or false positives noted).
 * Grouping into horizontal layers via group_blocks worked well, correctly separating layers (e.g., in example 1, three separate layers for 1,6,4; in example 3, three layers with two digits each).
 * Output layout construction (borders, separators, positioning) was mostly correct: proper height/width calc, vertical stacking with 6-row increments, horizontal sorting and 6-col increments per digit, leading to correct overall structure and spacing in all examples.
 * Training example 2 was fully correct, indicating the block detection, grouping, and layout handle simple cases (likely single-layer or matching patterns) perfectly.
 * digit_masks were fundamentally incorrect, causing pixel-level mismatches in patterns: e.g., in training 1, '1' generated had wide base and misplaced pixels (row2:1,0,0,1,1 vs expected narrow right:0,0,0,0,1; row3:1,1,0,1,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1; row4:1,0,0,0,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1), '6' had wrong curve (row4:1,0,1,1,1 vs expected 1,0,1,0,1?), '4' mismatched crossbar/legs; similar issues in training 3 for '8' (row4:1,1,1,0,1 vs expected ?), '4' legs wrong, '3' curve off (row3:1,1,0,0,1 vs 1,0,0,0,1?), '9' top/bottom wrong.
 * get_digit_pattern is helpful but broken due to bad masks; it correctly applies c/b but uses wrong binary shapes, leading to all pattern failures except possibly '2' or cases where mask accidentally matched.
 * program main function is mostly solid (handles empty grid, iterates groups correctly) but inherits mask errors; no issues with background filling or size.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (find_solid_blocks, group_blocks, get_digit_pattern) are relevant, though masks need full correction from expected patterns.
 * Subtle miss: Assumes digit identity from block color (c as key), which works if colors map uniquely to digits, but patterns must be standard 7-segment-like or puzzle-specific (inferred from diffs: asymmetric, like LCD/LED digits).
 * Training 1 and 3 failed entirely due to pattern mismatches, not layout—e.g., train1 generated symmetric/wrong '1' (left-heavy), train3 swapped pixels in '4' row3 (1,1,4,1,4 vs expected 1,0,0,0,1? wait, actually from diff: generated row3 for first '4':4,1,4,1,4 but expected 4,1,1,1,4? No, looking closely: mismatches are specific pixel flips, e.g., train3 '4' row3 generated [4,1,1,1,4,1] wait no, the shown is per row but aggregated.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_solid_blocks serves as essential for identifying "objects" (blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same pattern errors from training 1/3: e.g., top layer '4' and '8' show wide/misplaced pixels (row2 for '4':[4,3,3,3,4,3] wait, no—shown as [3,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,3] for row1, but row3:[3,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,3,3,8,8,3] indicates wrong mask for '4' (expected narrow or specific from train3 '4'), '8' has off-curve; middle layer '2' and '1' mismatch (row3 for '2':[2,3,3,2,2,3] vs likely expected curved top; '1' row4:[1,3,3,3,1,3] wrong stem); bottom '6' and '9' have similar curve/flip errors as train1 '6'.
 * It correctly detects and places 6 blocks in 3 layers (two per layer, like train3), with proper borders/separators and background 3, but patterns are invalid (e.g., '1' not narrow vertical, '9' row4:[9,9,3,9,9,3] vs expected from train3 [9,1,1,9,9,1] adjusted).
 * Test input has layers separated by background rows (rows 0,6,12 full 3; blocks at rows1-5,7-11,13-17), solid 5x5 of colors 4/8 top, 2/1 middle, 6/9 bottom—output structure matches this, but patterns do not, so it fails like train1/3.
 * To fix for test, correct all masks to match inferred expected (e.g., '1' right-aligned stem, '4' open top with cross, etc.); without this, test will always mismatch pixel-by-pixel.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    bg = g[0][0] if g else 0

    def find_solid_blocks(g: List[List[int]], b: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
        rows = len(g)
        if rows == 0:
            return []
        cols = len(g[0])

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:39:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid `g` contains multiple 5x5 patterned "digit" blocks (non-background pixels of a single color forming shapes like digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 on a background color), arranged in one or more horizontal rows, and the task is to detect these 5x5 blocks, group them into their rows, and render an enlarged output grid where each 5x5 pattern is copied verbatim into a 7x7 framed cell (with 1-layer background borders around and between digits in a row, and full background rows separating different rows of digits).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input patterns are not solid blocks; they are sparse pixel art shapes (e.g., connected or semi-connected non-bg pixels of one color per 5x5 block forming digit-like shapes), so detection must identify candidate 5x5 subgrids where all non-bg cells share exactly one color != bg, and the pattern has sufficient non-bg pixels (e.g., >10-15 to qualify as a digit, avoiding noise).
 * Background color `bg` is dynamically determined (e.g., g[0][0]), and the output uses the same bg for all borders/padding; non-bg color per block is preserved from input.
 * Blocks are exactly 5x5; scan every possible top-left (r,c) where r <= len(g)-5, c <= len(g[0])-5, and validate the subgrid as a digit block (e.g., single non-bg color, no other colors, pattern not all bg or all non-bg).
 * Grouping: Blocks in the same horizontal row have starting rows differing by <5 (overlapping or adjacent 5x5), sorted by row then column; vertical stacks (different rows of digits) form separate groups if row starts differ by >=5.
 * Output dimensions: For `num_layers` rows of digits, `max_m` digits per row; height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (1 top bg + 5 pattern + 1 bottom bg per layer, but adjacent layers share the separator bg row effectively via spacing); width = 6 * max_m + 1 (1 left bg + 5 pattern + 1 right bg per digit).
 * Placement: For layer `l_idx`, base row `r0 = 1 + l_idx * 6`; for digit pos in group, base col `c0 = 1 + pos * 6`; copy the exact 5x5 subgrid from input to out[r0:r0+5][c0:c0+5].
 * Subtleties: No extra separators beyond the 1-bg padding; if no blocks, output a bg-filled grid same size as input (or empty); assume rectangular input; digits may be adjacent or spaced, but detection assumes exact 5x5 bounding boxes; possible empty rows/columns of bg; colors are small ints (1-9, bg varies like 8,4,1,3); no rotation or scaling, just copy; invalid/malformed 5x5 (e.g., multiple colors) should be ignored or treated as bg.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for same "digit" (e.g., 1) vary across examples (train1 '1' has row2: c bg bg bg c; train2 '1' has row2: c bg bg c c), confirming we must copy input patterns exactly, not use fixed masks; detection must tolerate sparse patterns (e.g., 3 in train3 has only ~15-20 non-bg pixels); grouping must handle vertical arrangements (train3 has 2 layers); output must preserve exact input pixel values in patterns, including if a "digit" has isolated pixels.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            for subrow in sub:
                for val in subrow:
                    if val != bg:
                        non_bg_colors.add(val)

            current_group.append(blk)
        else:
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = [blk]
    groups.append(current_group)
    for group in groups:
        group.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by col within group
    return groups
```

The `find_solid_blocks` from the attempt is broken/unhelpful (assumes all 25 cells same non-bg color, but inputs have sparse patterns; ignore it in future). The `get_digit_pattern` is unhelpful/broken (uses fixed masks instead of copying input; do not use). The output canvas init and placement logic (r0/c0 calculation) is helpful/accurate for framing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed input has solid 5x5 blocks where color value encodes the digit type, and rendered fixed 5x5 masks filled with that color; this is incorrect—inputs have pre-patterned 5x5 shapes to copy directly.
 * Detection failed to find actual blocks (or found none, but results show it ran with defaults/fallbacks), leading to no blocks or wrong positions in some cases.
 * Fixed masks were partially correct (e.g., for 2,6,8,9 matched expected patterns by coincidence in some trains) but wrong for 1,3,4 (e.g., train1 '1' generated row2: c bg bg c c but expected c bg bg bg c; row4: c bg bg bg c expected same but mismatched elsewhere; train2 '4' not present but would mismatch).
 * For train1: Generated '1' pattern wrong (row2:1 8 8 1 1 vs expected 1 8 8 8 1; row3:1 1 8 1 1 matches; row4:1 8 8 8 1 matches); '6' and bottom '4' patterns correct by mask luck; overall incorrect due to '1' and partial '4' (generated row3 for '4':4 8 8 8 4 vs expected 4 8 4 8 4; row4:4 4 8 4 4 vs expected 4 8 4 8 4).
 * For train2: '1' pattern accidentally matched expected (row2:1 4 4 1 1, row3:1 1 4 1 1, row4:1 4 4 4 1); '2' matched fully; '3' wrong (solid all-3 vs expected patterned like row2:3 4 3 4 3, row3:3 4 4 4 3, row4:3 3 4 4 3); incorrect due to missing/wrong '3' handling.
 * For train3: Upper layer ('8','4')—'8' matched expected fully; '4' wrong (generated row2:4 1 4 1 4 vs expected 4 1 1 1 4? Wait, expected row2 for '4':4 1 4 1 4 matches code but human expected lists row2:4 1 4 1 4 1, yes partial match but row3:4 1 1 1 4 vs generated 4 1 1 1 4? Actually mismatches in details like row4 for '4': generated 4 4 1 4 4 vs expected 4 4 1 4 4 matches, but overall listed as incorrect—likely due to lower layer); lower layer '3' solid/wrong (all 3 vs expected row2:3 1 1 1 3, row3:3 3 1 3 3, row4:3 3 1 3 3); '9' matched expected fully.
 * Grouping and framing worked well (positions/spacing correct across all trains, e.g., horizontal pairs in train3, triple in train2, single-row triple? in train1).
 * Default mask (all filled) used for missing digits like 3, leading to solid blocks instead of patterns.
 * No handling for varying patterns per "digit" across examples (e.g., '1' shape differs between train1 and train2, proving copy-input not fixed-render).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it renders fixed mask-based patterns (e.g., upper layer presumed '4' and '8': '4' uses code's mask row2:4 3 3 3 4? Wait, bg=3, c=4 for first: row2:4 3 4 3 4 vs likely input pattern like train2's '4' but unknown; '8' row2:8 3 3 8 8 matches standard but may not copy input; lower '2' and '1': '2' matches standard but input likely has custom; '1' uses wrong mask row2:1 3 3 1 1 vs possible input variant; bottom '6' and '9' match standards but again not copied).
 * It is missing exact replication of input 5x5 patterns (e.g., if test input '1' has train1-style row2:1 3 3 3 1, generated has 1 3 3 1 1—different); solid-like for any unmasked digits.
 * Generated assumes solid detection (likely found no/mis blocks or fallback), but positions suggest it detected something; overall wrong because it doesn't copy input patterns, leading to mismatches like train examples.
 * To handle test: Update detection to find patterned 5x5 (using improved `find_digit_blocks`), copy subgrids directly; account for 3 layers (upper '4''8', mid '2''1', lower '6''9'?) with bg=3; ensure non-bg count filter avoids false positives.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:39:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid consists of isolated 5x5 solid-colored blocks separated by background (bg) rows/columns, and the goal is to produce an output grid that preserves the overall structure (including bg separators and borders) but transforms each solid 5x5 block into a specific non-solid pattern using the block's color and bg to form shapes (likely letters or symbols). The previous program correctly detects and locates the blocks while copying the grid structure but fails by filling blocks solidly instead of applying the required patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids contain uniform 5x5 solid blocks of a single color (c != bg), separated by single rows/columns of bg; blocks do not overlap and are axis-aligned.
 * Output must retain the full grid dimensions and positions, including all bg borders and separators between blocks (no true compression; separators become full bg rows/columns in output).
 * Each 5x5 block must be transformed from solid c to a unique pattern where some cells remain c and others revert to bg, forming distinct shapes; patterns vary by block position/order/color and are not solid or simple frames.
 * Bg is consistently the corner value (e.g., 8, 4, 1, 3 across examples); blocks are only detected if entirely uniform and != bg.
 * Patterns appear to represent letters/symbols in a 5x5 dot-matrix style (e.g., 'O'-like ring, 'C'-like curve, 'H'-like structure, 'E'-like, 'P'-like); the rule for generating patterns per block is unknown but position-dependent (e.g., first block in ex1 is ring-shaped for color 1, second is 'C'-shaped for 6).
 * Subtle: Patterns use bg to "carve out" shapes inside the 5x5, so overrides must selectively set cells to c or bg; simple frames or solids fail.
 * Separators (1-row/column bg gaps) must be preserved as full bg lines in output; no merging or removal.
 * Grids can be vertical stacks (ex1, ex3 partial), horizontal (ex2, ex3 partial), or mixed; blocks may share rows/columns if adjacent but are isolated by bg.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no blocks means full bg grid; blocks at edges include outer bg borders.
 * Unknown subtlety: Exact pattern rule (e.g., hardcoded per position, derived from color, or puzzle-specific sequence) is not implemented; attempting solids or basic frames mismatches all examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the top-left value, consistent across examples; useful for distinguishing blocks.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[dict]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(h - 4):
        for j in range(w - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_block = True
            for di in range(5):
                for dj in range(5):
                    if g[i + di][j + dj] != c:
                        is_block = False
                        break
                if not is_block:
                    break
            if is_block:
                blocks.append({'r': i, 'c': j, 'color': c})
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects all 5x5 uniform solid blocks != bg, returning their positions and colors; essential for identifying what to transform; works correctly in all examples as positions match expected outputs.)

```python
def build_map(starts: List[int], size: int) -> List[int]:
    if not starts:
        return list(range(size))  # fallback
    out_map = []
    first_start = starts[0]
    if first_start > 0:
        out_map.append(0)
    prev_end = first_start - 1
    for idx, s in enumerate(starts):
        if idx > 0 and s > starts[idx - 1] + 5:
            out_map.append(starts[idx - 1] + 5)
        for k in range(5):
            out_map.append(s + k)
        prev_end = s + 4
    if prev_end < size - 1:
        out_map.append(prev_end + 1)
    return out_map
```
(This generates a row/column index map that includes block positions + preceding bg (top/borders) + inter-block separators + trailing bg; in practice for 1-row gaps, it includes all indices, preserving full structure; helpful for structured copying but overkill if output mirrors input dimensions exactly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly detects all 5x5 solid blocks via find_blocks (positions and colors match expected block locations in all training examples).
 * Preserves overall grid structure, dimensions, bg borders, and single-row/column separators between blocks (e.g., ex1 outputs 19 rows with bg rows at 1,7,13 positions; ex2 keeps horizontal separators; ex3 handles mixed vertical/horizontal).
 * build_map correctly includes all necessary rows/columns without omission or extra compression, leading to out being a full-sized copy of input before overrides.
 * Fails to transform blocks: overrides 5x5 areas with solid color c instead of patterns, resulting in uniform fills (e.g., ex1 top block all 1s vs. expected ring pattern with 8s inside; ex2 color 1 all 1s vs. expected 'E'-like with 4s carved out).
 * In ex1: generated solid 5x5 blocks for colors 1,6,4 separated by bg rows, but expected has unique patterns (1: ring/diamond; 6: asymmetric curve like 'C'; 4: cross like 'H' or 'X' variant); difference is all internal cells solid vs. selective bg carving.
 * In ex2: generated solid horizontal 5x5 for 1,2,3 with bg=4 separators, but expected patterns (1: 'E'-like with bg fills; 2: zigzag or 'Z'; 3: irregular like 'F'); difference unknown rule for pattern shapes but clearly not solid.
 * In ex3: generated solid pairs (upper:8 and4; lower:3 and9) with bg=1, but expected patterns (8: 'P'-like; 4: filled with bg cross; 3: curve; 9: symmetric); difference in internal structure, with generated ignoring pattern variety.
 * get_bg works perfectly (correctly IDs 8,4,1,3).
 * The override loop in program() is broken/not helpful: sets entire 5x5 to c (solid), but needs pattern-specific logic (e.g., if/then for positions); commented frame example is unhelpful/wrong as it doesn't match any expected.
 * Initial fill out[i_out][j_out] = g[i_in][j_in] copies input solids correctly but is redundant since override wipes it; unhelpful for transformation.
 * No pattern generation logic implemented, leading to all training failures; core issue is assuming solid output blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows solid 5x5 blocks (colors 4 upper-left, 8 upper-right, 2 lower-left, 1 lower-middle? Wait, listing suggests vertical stack of horizontals: upper pair 4/8, mid bg, lower pair 2/1, then another bg, then 6/9 pair) separated by bg=3 rows, preserving structure like training.
 * Does not look correct: Based on training, blocks should have unique internal patterns (e.g., carved bg shapes forming letters/symbols) instead of solids; e.g., upper 4 block all 4s vs. likely a specific shape like in ex1's 4 ('H'-like); same for 8,2,1,6,9.
 * Missing transformation: All blocks uniform, ignoring pattern rule; if test follows training, output should have bg-carved shapes in each 5x5 (e.g., curves, rings, crosses), making solids visibly wrong.
 * Structure matches expected style (full grid with separators), but content fails similarly to training (solids vs. patterns).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid `g` contains multiple 5x5 patterned "digit" blocks (non-background pixels of a single color forming shapes like digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 on a background color), arranged in one or more horizontal rows, and the task is to detect these 5x5 blocks, group them into their rows, and render an enlarged output grid where each 5x5 pattern is copied verbatim into a 7x7 framed cell (with 1-layer background borders around and between digits in a row, and full background rows separating different rows of digits).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input patterns are not solid blocks; they are sparse pixel art shapes (e.g., connected or semi-connected non-bg pixels of one color per 5x5 block forming digit-like shapes), so detection must identify candidate 5x5 subgrids where all non-bg cells share exactly one color != bg, and the pattern has sufficient non-bg pixels (e.g., >10-15 to qualify as a digit, avoiding noise).
 * Background color `bg` is dynamically determined (e.g., g[0][0]), and the output uses the same bg for all borders/padding; non-bg color per block is preserved from input.
 * Blocks are exactly 5x5; scan every possible top-left (r,c) where r <= len(g)-5, c <= len(g[0])-5, and validate the subgrid as a digit block (e.g., single non-bg color, no other colors, pattern not all bg or all non-bg).
 * Grouping: Blocks in the same horizontal row have starting rows differing by <5 (overlapping or adjacent 5x5), sorted by row then column; vertical stacks (different rows of digits) form separate groups if row starts differ by >=5.
 * Output dimensions: For `num_layers` rows of digits, `max_m` digits per row; height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (1 top bg + 5 pattern + 1 bottom bg per layer, but adjacent layers share the separator bg row effectively via spacing); width = 6 * max_m + 1 (1 left bg + 5 pattern + 1 right bg per digit).
 * Placement: For layer `l_idx`, base row `r0 = 1 + l_idx * 6`; for digit pos in group, base col `c0 = 1 + pos * 6`; copy the exact 5x5 subgrid from input to out[r0:r0+5][c0:c0+5].
 * Subtleties: No extra separators beyond the 1-bg padding; if no blocks, output a bg-filled grid same size as input (or empty); assume rectangular input; digits may be adjacent or spaced, but detection assumes exact 5x5 bounding boxes; possible empty rows/columns of bg; colors are small ints (1-9, bg varies like 8,4,1,3); no rotation or scaling, just copy; invalid/malformed 5x5 (e.g., multiple colors) should be ignored or treated as bg.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for same "digit" (e.g., 1) vary across examples (train1 '1' has row2: c bg bg bg c; train2 '1' has row2: c bg bg c c), confirming we must copy input patterns exactly, not use fixed masks; detection must tolerate sparse patterns (e.g., 3 in train3 has only ~15-20 non-bg pixels); grouping must handle vertical arrangements (train3 has 2 layers); output must preserve exact input pixel values in patterns, including if a "digit" has isolated pixels.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_digit_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (start_row, start_col, non_bg_color); improved from solid_blocks
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0]) if rows > 0 else 0
    blocks = []
    for r in range(rows - 4):
        for c in range(cols - 4):
            sub = [row[c:c+5] for row in g[r:r+5]]
            non_bg_colors = set()
            non_bg_count = 0
            for subrow in sub:
                for val in subrow:
                    if val != bg:
                        non_bg_colors.add(val)
                        non_bg_count += 1
            if len(non_bg_colors) == 1 and non_bg_count > 0 and non_bg_count < 25:  # Single non-bg color, not empty or solid
                color = next(iter(non_bg_colors))
                blocks.append((r, c, color))
    return blocks
```

```python
def group_blocks(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    if not blocks:
        return []
    # Sort by starting row, then col
    sorted_blocks = sorted(blocks, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    groups = []
    current_group = [sorted_blocks[0]]
    for blk in sorted_blocks[1:]:
        if blk[0] - current_group[-1][0] < 5:  # Same row if starts within 4 rows
            current_group.append(blk)
        else:
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = [blk]
    groups.append(current_group)
    for group in groups:
        group.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort by col within group
    return groups
```

The `find_solid_blocks` from the attempt is broken/unhelpful (assumes all 25 cells same non-bg color, but inputs have sparse patterns; ignore it in future). The `get_digit_pattern` is unhelpful/broken (uses fixed masks instead of copying input; do not use). The output canvas init and placement logic (r0/c0 calculation) is helpful/accurate for framing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed input has solid 5x5 blocks where color value encodes the digit type, and rendered fixed 5x5 masks filled with that color; this is incorrect—inputs have pre-patterned 5x5 shapes to copy directly.
 * Detection failed to find actual blocks (or found none, but results show it ran with defaults/fallbacks), leading to no blocks or wrong positions in some cases.
 * Fixed masks were partially correct (e.g., for 2,6,8,9 matched expected patterns by coincidence in some trains) but wrong for 1,3,4 (e.g., train1 '1' generated row2: c bg bg c c but expected c bg bg bg c; row4: c bg bg bg c expected same but mismatched elsewhere; train2 '4' not present but would mismatch).
 * For train1: Generated '1' pattern wrong (row2:1 8 8 1 1 vs expected 1 8 8 8 1; row3:1 1 8 1 1 matches; row4:1 8 8 8 1 matches); '6' and bottom '4' patterns correct by mask luck; overall incorrect due to '1' and partial '4' (generated row3 for '4':4 8 8 8 4 vs expected 4 8 4 8 4; row4:4 4 8 4 4 vs expected 4 8 4 8 4).
 * For train2: '1' pattern accidentally matched expected (row2:1 4 4 1 1, row3:1 1 4 1 1, row4:1 4 4 4 1); '2' matched fully; '3' wrong (solid all-3 vs expected patterned like row2:3 4 3 4 3, row3:3 4 4 4 3, row4:3 3 4 4 3); incorrect due to missing/wrong '3' handling.
 * For train3: Upper layer ('8','4')—'8' matched expected fully; '4' wrong (generated row2:4 1 4 1 4 vs expected 4 1 1 1 4? Wait, expected row2 for '4':4 1 4 1 4 matches code but human expected lists row2:4 1 4 1 4 1, yes partial match but row3:4 1 1 1 4 vs generated 4 1 1 1 4? Actually mismatches in details like row4 for '4': generated 4 4 1 4 4 vs expected 4 4 1 4 4 matches, but overall listed as incorrect—likely due to lower layer); lower layer '3' solid/wrong (all 3 vs expected row2:3 1 1 1 3, row3:3 3 1 3 3, row4:3 3 1 3 3); '9' matched expected fully.
 * Grouping and framing worked well (positions/spacing correct across all trains, e.g., horizontal pairs in train3, triple in train2, single-row triple? in train1).
 * Default mask (all filled) used for missing digits like 3, leading to solid blocks instead of patterns.
 * No handling for varying patterns per "digit" across examples (e.g., '1' shape differs between train1 and train2, proving copy-input not fixed-render).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it renders fixed mask-based patterns (e.g., upper layer presumed '4' and '8': '4' uses code's mask row2:4 3 3 3 4? Wait, bg=3, c=4 for first: row2:4 3 4 3 4 vs likely input pattern like train2's '4' but unknown; '8' row2:8 3 3 8 8 matches standard but may not copy input; lower '2' and '1': '2' matches standard but input likely has custom; '1' uses wrong mask row2:1 3 3 1 1 vs possible input variant; bottom '6' and '9' match standards but again not copied).
 * It is missing exact replication of input 5x5 patterns (e.g., if test input '1' has train1-style row2:1 3 3 3 1, generated has 1 3 3 1 1—different); solid-like for any unmasked digits.
 * Generated assumes solid detection (likely found no/mis blocks or fallback), but positions suggest it detected something; overall wrong because it doesn't copy input patterns, leading to mismatches like train examples.
 * To handle test: Update detection to find patterned 5x5 (using improved `find_digit_blocks`), copy subgrids directly; account for 3 layers (upper '4''8', mid '2''1', lower '6''9'?) with bg=3; ensure non-bg count filter avoids false positives.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain multiple 5x5 solid uniform-color blocks (non-background) arranged in horizontal layers, each representing a digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), and the goal is to generate an output grid that replaces each solid block with its corresponding 5x5 patterned pixel-art representation of the digit, arranged in the same relative positions but embedded in a larger grid with background borders, row separators, and column separators between digits in the same layer. The output preserves the layered structure, with each layer of digits separated vertically by a full background row, and digits within a layer separated horizontally by a single background column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is always the value at g[0][0] and fills all non-pattern areas, including full borders around the entire output, single-column separators between digits in the same row/layer, and full-row separators (height 1) between layers.
 * Solid blocks are exactly 5x5 uniform non-background pixels; they must be detected precisely without overlapping detection issues, and only these are replaced—any non-solid or background areas remain unchanged in concept but are reconstructed in the output layout.
 * Blocks are grouped into "layers" if their starting rows differ by less than 5 (indicating horizontal alignment/overlap in the same "row" of the puzzle), and within each layer, blocks are sorted left-to-right by starting column.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (accounting for 5 pattern rows + 1 separator per layer, plus top/bottom borders), width = 6 * max_digits_per_layer + 1 (5 pattern cols + 1 separator per digit, plus left/right borders); patterns start at offsets (1,1) per block with incremental positioning.
 * Digit patterns are fixed 5x5 binary masks (1=on/pixel color, 0=off/background), but the color of the digit is the uniform color of the detected solid block (c), not a fixed value—off pixels use b.
 * No support for digits 0,5,7 (masks only for 1,2,3,4,6,8,9); unknown digits default to solid, but this may cause issues if other digits appear.
 * Input grids have top/bottom/middle full background rows separating layers, and blocks do not overlap between layers.
 * Subtle: Patterns must exactly match expected pixel-art shapes (e.g., '1' is a vertical bar with serifs or specific offsets, not symmetric); mismatches in mask definitions lead to pixel-level differences.
 * If no blocks, output should be a background-filled grid of original size, but in practice, examples always have blocks.
 * Horizontal positioning in output assumes sorted left-to-right, with separators only between digits (no leading/trailing extras beyond borders).
 * Vertical positioning starts at row 1 for first layer, increments by 6 per layer (5 pattern +1 sep).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection of 5x5 solid blocks via find_solid_blocks worked correctly, as it identified the right positions and colors for all blocks in training examples (no missed or false positives noted).
 * Grouping into horizontal layers via group_blocks worked well, correctly separating layers (e.g., in example 1, three separate layers for 1,6,4; in example 3, three layers with two digits each).
 * Output layout construction (borders, separators, positioning) was mostly correct: proper height/width calc, vertical stacking with 6-row increments, horizontal sorting and 6-col increments per digit, leading to correct overall structure and spacing in all examples.
 * Training example 2 was fully correct, indicating the block detection, grouping, and layout handle simple cases (likely single-layer or matching patterns) perfectly.
 * digit_masks were fundamentally incorrect, causing pixel-level mismatches in patterns: e.g., in training 1, '1' generated had wide base and misplaced pixels (row2:1,0,0,1,1 vs expected narrow right:0,0,0,0,1; row3:1,1,0,1,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1; row4:1,0,0,0,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1), '6' had wrong curve (row4:1,0,1,1,1 vs expected 1,0,1,0,1?), '4' mismatched crossbar/legs; similar issues in training 3 for '8' (row4:1,1,1,0,1 vs expected ?), '4' legs wrong, '3' curve off (row3:1,1,0,0,1 vs 1,0,0,0,1?), '9' top/bottom wrong.
 * get_digit_pattern is helpful but broken due to bad masks; it correctly applies c/b but uses wrong binary shapes, leading to all pattern failures except possibly '2' or cases where mask accidentally matched.
 * program main function is mostly solid (handles empty grid, iterates groups correctly) but inherits mask errors; no issues with background filling or size.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (find_solid_blocks, group_blocks, get_digit_pattern) are relevant, though masks need full correction from expected patterns.
 * Subtle miss: Assumes digit identity from block color (c as key), which works if colors map uniquely to digits, but patterns must be standard 7-segment-like or puzzle-specific (inferred from diffs: asymmetric, like LCD/LED digits).
 * Training 1 and 3 failed entirely due to pattern mismatches, not layout—e.g., train1 generated symmetric/wrong '1' (left-heavy), train3 swapped pixels in '4' row3 (1,1,4,1,4 vs expected 1,0,0,0,1? wait, actually from diff: generated row3 for first '4':4,1,4,1,4 but expected 4,1,1,1,4? No, looking closely: mismatches are specific pixel flips, e.g., train3 '4' row3 generated [4,1,1,1,4,1] wait no, the shown is per row but aggregated.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_solid_blocks serves as essential for identifying "objects" (blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same pattern errors from training 1/3: e.g., top layer '4' and '8' show wide/misplaced pixels (row2 for '4':[4,3,3,3,4,3] wait, no—shown as [3,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,3] for row1, but row3:[3,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,3,3,8,8,3] indicates wrong mask for '4' (expected narrow or specific from train3 '4'), '8' has off-curve; middle layer '2' and '1' mismatch (row3 for '2':[2,3,3,2,2,3] vs likely expected curved top; '1' row4:[1,3,3,3,1,3] wrong stem); bottom '6' and '9' have similar curve/flip errors as train1 '6'.
 * It correctly detects and places 6 blocks in 3 layers (two per layer, like train3), with proper borders/separators and background 3, but patterns are invalid (e.g., '1' not narrow vertical, '9' row4:[9,9,3,9,9,3] vs expected from train3 [9,1,1,9,9,1] adjusted).
 * Test input has layers separated by background rows (rows 0,6,12 full 3; blocks at rows1-5,7-11,13-17), solid 5x5 of colors 4/8 top, 2/1 middle, 6/9 bottom—output structure matches this, but patterns do not, so it fails like train1/3.
 * To fix for test, correct all masks to match inferred expected (e.g., '1' right-aligned stem, '4' open top with cross, etc.); without this, test will always mismatch pixel-by-pixel.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 11:48:07] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background colors representing digits, and the goal is to extract these blocks, group them into horizontal layers based on row proximity, interpret each block's color as a digit, replace each block with a predefined 5x5 pixel-art pattern for that digit (filled with the digit color against background), and arrange the patterns in a compact output grid with background borders and separators between layers and blocks. The output compacts the input by rendering only the stylized digit patterns in aligned layers, preserving the relative horizontal ordering within layers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is strictly the top-left grid value (grid[0][0]), and all non-solid-5x5 or background-matching areas are ignored in the output.
 * Blocks must be exactly 5x5 and entirely uniform in a single non-background color; overlapping or partial blocks are not considered—only perfect solid squares trigger detection.
 * Grouping into layers uses row-start differences: blocks are sorted by starting row then column, and grouped if consecutive starting rows differ by less than 5 (indicating same "layer" alignment, even if slightly offset vertically); within groups, sort by starting column for horizontal order.
 * Digit patterns are 5x5 binary masks (1=on/fill with block color, 0=off/background), but the predefined masks must exactly match the expected stylized shapes for digits like 1,2,3,4,6,8,9—current masks are approximate but fail to reproduce training expectations precisely.
 * Output grid dimensions: height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (1 top border + 5 pattern rows + 1 separator per layer), width = 6 * max_blocks_per_layer + 1 (1 left border + 5 pattern cols + 1 separator per block); entire grid initializes to background, with patterns placed at offsets (row: 1 + layer_idx*6, col: 1 + pos*6).
 * Separators and borders are single rows/columns of pure background, ensuring visual distinction between layers (horizontal separator rows) and blocks (vertical separator columns); no trimming or adjustment for empty layers.
 * If no blocks found, output mirrors the original grid (padded if needed, but preserves dimensions and content).
 * Colors are integers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 as digits), and patterns must be symmetric or stylized to match "pixel-art" digits—subtle pixel placements (e.g., exact positions of "off" pixels in curves or lines) are critical and often mismatched.
 * Horizontal alignment in output preserves input order within layers, but vertical offsets in input are collapsed—layers are strictly stacked with fixed spacing.
 * Only digits 1-9 (skipping 5,7,0?) are handled; fallback to full solid 5x5 if undefined, but this isn't triggered in examples.
 * Potential overlaps or adjacent blocks in input don't merge—each 5x5 is independent, but detection skips if starting position would overlap prior checks (sliding window from top-left).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; core detection and grouping logic works for training example 3 (correct output), demonstrating understanding of block extraction, layering, and compact arrangement.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated patterns for digits 1,6,4 have pixel mismatches—e.g., digit 1 row 2 has [1,8,8,1,1] but expected [1,8,8,8,1]; digit 6 row 3 has [6,8,8,6,6] but expected [6,8,6,8,6]; digit 4 row 4 has [4,4,8,4,4] but expected [4,8,4,8,4]—likely due to incorrect mask definitions not matching expected stylized digits.
 * Failed training example 2: Similar mask issues—digit 1 row 2 [1,4,4,1,1] vs expected [1,4,4,1,1] (close but row 3 [1,1,4,1,1] vs [1,1,4,1,1]? Wait, mismatches in digit 2 row 4 [2,4,2,4,2] vs expected [2,4,4,2,2]; digit 3 row 2 [3,4,4,4,3] vs [3,4,3,4,3]—exact pixel placements off, causing "off-by-one" in curves/lines.
 * Grouping and positioning worked in all (e.g., correct layer separation and horizontal order), but empty areas and borders are properly bg-filled.
 * detect_solid_5x5_blocks is essential and correct—accurately finds blocks without false positives.
 * group_blocks_by_row_alignment handles subtle vertical offsets (<5 rows) as same layer, which is key for aligned but not perfectly row-matched blocks.
 * Output sizing and placement logic is solid, producing correct dimensions and no overlaps.
 * Issue: Masks are the core failure point—attempt assumes generic shapes but training shows specific, non-standard pixel-art (e.g., digit 4 lacks crossbar in expected); unknown why shapes differ, but must reverse-engineer from expectations.
 * No omission of blocks or layers; handles multiple per layer correctly.
 * Fallback to original grid if no blocks is unused but correct.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic: detects blocks for colors 4 and 8 in layer 0 (rows ~1-5 start), 2 and 1 in layer 1 (rows ~7-11), 6 and 9 in layer 2 (rows ~13-17); arranges in 3 layers with max 2 blocks/layer, producing 19x13 grid with borders/separators.
 * Patterns use the flawed masks, so likely incorrect—e.g., digit 4 row 2 [4,3,4,3,4] suggests mask mismatch similar to training 1/2 (expected might have different "open" positions based on patterns); digit 8 row 3 [8,3,3,8,8] vs potential expected with more symmetry.
 * Structure makes sense (layers stacked, horizontal order preserved, bg separators), but pixel details probably wrong—e.g., digit 1 in layer 1 row 9 [1,3,3,1,1] may not match a clean vertical stem; overall, output is compact and layered correctly but patterns don't look like standard digits (jagged/ asymmetric due to bad masks).
 * Does not look fully correct: While layout is plausible, the specific pixel "on/off" in patterns (e.g., digit 9 row 15 [9,3,3,9,9] with unexpected fills) deviates from training expectations, suggesting same mask issue persists; test likely expects precise shapes to "read" as digits visually.
 * Accounts for multi-layer with varying block counts, but if input has offset rows within <5, grouping is handled—output visually separates layers well, but without expected test grid, can't confirm block detection accuracy.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 11:48:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid consists of isolated 5x5 solid-colored blocks separated by background (bg) rows/columns, and the goal is to produce an output grid that preserves the overall structure (including bg separators and borders) but transforms each solid 5x5 block into a specific non-solid pattern using the block's color and bg to form shapes (likely letters or symbols). The previous program correctly detects and locates the blocks while copying the grid structure but fails by filling blocks solidly instead of applying the required patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Input grids contain uniform 5x5 solid blocks of a single color (c != bg), separated by single rows/columns of bg; blocks do not overlap and are axis-aligned.
 * Output must retain the full grid dimensions and positions, including all bg borders and separators between blocks (no true compression; separators become full bg rows/columns in output).
 * Each 5x5 block must be transformed from solid c to a unique pattern where some cells remain c and others revert to bg, forming distinct shapes; patterns vary by block position/order/color and are not solid or simple frames.
 * Bg is consistently the corner value (e.g., 8, 4, 1, 3 across examples); blocks are only detected if entirely uniform and != bg.
 * Patterns appear to represent letters/symbols in a 5x5 dot-matrix style (e.g., 'O'-like ring, 'C'-like curve, 'H'-like structure, 'E'-like, 'P'-like); the rule for generating patterns per block is unknown but position-dependent (e.g., first block in ex1 is ring-shaped for color 1, second is 'C'-shaped for 6).
 * Subtle: Patterns use bg to "carve out" shapes inside the 5x5, so overrides must selectively set cells to c or bg; simple frames or solids fail.
 * Separators (1-row/column bg gaps) must be preserved as full bg lines in output; no merging or removal.
 * Grids can be vertical stacks (ex1, ex3 partial), horizontal (ex2, ex3 partial), or mixed; blocks may share rows/columns if adjacent but are isolated by bg.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; no blocks means full bg grid; blocks at edges include outer bg borders.
 * Unknown subtlety: Exact pattern rule (e.g., hardcoded per position, derived from color, or puzzle-specific sequence) is not implemented; attempting solids or basic frames mismatches all examples.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies bg as the top-left value, consistent across examples; useful for distinguishing blocks.)

```python
def find_blocks(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[dict]:
    h = len(g)
    w = len(g[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    blocks = []
    for i in range(h - 4):
        for j in range(w - 4):
            c = g[i][j]
            if c == bg:
                continue
            is_block = True
            for di in range(5):
                for dj in range(5):
                    if g[i + di][j + dj] != c:
                        is_block = False
                        break
                if not is_block:
                    break
            if is_block:
                blocks.append({'r': i, 'c': j, 'color': c})
    return blocks
```
(This accurately detects all 5x5 uniform solid blocks != bg, returning their positions and colors; essential for identifying what to transform; works correctly in all examples as positions match expected outputs.)

```python
def build_map(starts: List[int], size: int) -> List[int]:
    if not starts:
        return list(range(size))  # fallback
    out_map = []
    first_start = starts[0]
    if first_start > 0:
        out_map.append(0)
    prev_end = first_start - 1
    for idx, s in enumerate(starts):
        if idx > 0 and s > starts[idx - 1] + 5:
            out_map.append(starts[idx - 1] + 5)
        for k in range(5):
            out_map.append(s + k)
        prev_end = s + 4
    if prev_end < size - 1:
        out_map.append(prev_end + 1)
    return out_map
```
(This generates a row/column index map that includes block positions + preceding bg (top/borders) + inter-block separators + trailing bg; in practice for 1-row gaps, it includes all indices, preserving full structure; helpful for structured copying but overkill if output mirrors input dimensions exactly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Correctly detects all 5x5 solid blocks via find_blocks (positions and colors match expected block locations in all training examples).
 * Preserves overall grid structure, dimensions, bg borders, and single-row/column separators between blocks (e.g., ex1 outputs 19 rows with bg rows at 1,7,13 positions; ex2 keeps horizontal separators; ex3 handles mixed vertical/horizontal).
 * build_map correctly includes all necessary rows/columns without omission or extra compression, leading to out being a full-sized copy of input before overrides.
 * Fails to transform blocks: overrides 5x5 areas with solid color c instead of patterns, resulting in uniform fills (e.g., ex1 top block all 1s vs. expected ring pattern with 8s inside; ex2 color 1 all 1s vs. expected 'E'-like with 4s carved out).
 * In ex1: generated solid 5x5 blocks for colors 1,6,4 separated by bg rows, but expected has unique patterns (1: ring/diamond; 6: asymmetric curve like 'C'; 4: cross like 'H' or 'X' variant); difference is all internal cells solid vs. selective bg carving.
 * In ex2: generated solid horizontal 5x5 for 1,2,3 with bg=4 separators, but expected patterns (1: 'E'-like with bg fills; 2: zigzag or 'Z'; 3: irregular like 'F'); difference unknown rule for pattern shapes but clearly not solid.
 * In ex3: generated solid pairs (upper:8 and4; lower:3 and9) with bg=1, but expected patterns (8: 'P'-like; 4: filled with bg cross; 3: curve; 9: symmetric); difference in internal structure, with generated ignoring pattern variety.
 * get_bg works perfectly (correctly IDs 8,4,1,3).
 * The override loop in program() is broken/not helpful: sets entire 5x5 to c (solid), but needs pattern-specific logic (e.g., if/then for positions); commented frame example is unhelpful/wrong as it doesn't match any expected.
 * Initial fill out[i_out][j_out] = g[i_in][j_in] copies input solids correctly but is redundant since override wipes it; unhelpful for transformation.
 * No pattern generation logic implemented, leading to all training failures; core issue is assuming solid output blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows solid 5x5 blocks (colors 4 upper-left, 8 upper-right, 2 lower-left, 1 lower-middle? Wait, listing suggests vertical stack of horizontals: upper pair 4/8, mid bg, lower pair 2/1, then another bg, then 6/9 pair) separated by bg=3 rows, preserving structure like training.
 * Does not look correct: Based on training, blocks should have unique internal patterns (e.g., carved bg shapes forming letters/symbols) instead of solids; e.g., upper 4 block all 4s vs. likely a specific shape like in ex1's 4 ('H'-like); same for 8,2,1,6,9.
 * Missing transformation: All blocks uniform, ignoring pattern rule; if test follows training, output should have bg-carved shapes in each 5x5 (e.g., curves, rings, crosses), making solids visibly wrong.
 * Structure matches expected style (full grid with separators), but content fails similarly to training (solids vs. patterns).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid `g` contains multiple 5x5 patterned "digit" blocks (non-background pixels of a single color forming shapes like digits 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 on a background color), arranged in one or more horizontal rows, and the task is to detect these 5x5 blocks, group them into their rows, and render an enlarged output grid where each 5x5 pattern is copied verbatim into a 7x7 framed cell (with 1-layer background borders around and between digits in a row, and full background rows separating different rows of digits).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input patterns are not solid blocks; they are sparse pixel art shapes (e.g., connected or semi-connected non-bg pixels of one color per 5x5 block forming digit-like shapes), so detection must identify candidate 5x5 subgrids where all non-bg cells share exactly one color != bg, and the pattern has sufficient non-bg pixels (e.g., >10-15 to qualify as a digit, avoiding noise).
 * Background color `bg` is dynamically determined (e.g., g[0][0]), and the output uses the same bg for all borders/padding; non-bg color per block is preserved from input.
 * Blocks are exactly 5x5; scan every possible top-left (r,c) where r <= len(g)-5, c <= len(g[0])-5, and validate the subgrid as a digit block (e.g., single non-bg color, no other colors, pattern not all bg or all non-bg).
 * Grouping: Blocks in the same horizontal row have starting rows differing by <5 (overlapping or adjacent 5x5), sorted by row then column; vertical stacks (different rows of digits) form separate groups if row starts differ by >=5.
 * Output dimensions: For `num_layers` rows of digits, `max_m` digits per row; height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (1 top bg + 5 pattern + 1 bottom bg per layer, but adjacent layers share the separator bg row effectively via spacing); width = 6 * max_m + 1 (1 left bg + 5 pattern + 1 right bg per digit).
 * Placement: For layer `l_idx`, base row `r0 = 1 + l_idx * 6`; for digit pos in group, base col `c0 = 1 + pos * 6`; copy the exact 5x5 subgrid from input to out[r0:r0+5][c0:c0+5].
 * Subtleties: No extra separators beyond the 1-bg padding; if no blocks, output a bg-filled grid same size as input (or empty); assume rectangular input; digits may be adjacent or spaced, but detection assumes exact 5x5 bounding boxes; possible empty rows/columns of bg; colors are small ints (1-9, bg varies like 8,4,1,3); no rotation or scaling, just copy; invalid/malformed 5x5 (e.g., multiple colors) should be ignored or treated as bg.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns for same "digit" (e.g., 1) vary across examples (train1 '1' has row2: c bg bg bg c; train2 '1' has row2: c bg bg c c), confirming we must copy input patterns exactly, not use fixed masks; detection must tolerate sparse patterns (e.g., 3 in train3 has only ~15-20 non-bg pixels); grouping must handle vertical arrangements (train3 has 2 layers); output must preserve exact input pixel values in patterns, including if a "digit" has isolated pixels.

The `find_solid_blocks` from the attempt is broken/unhelpful (assumes all 25 cells same non-bg color, but inputs have sparse patterns; ignore it in future). The `get_digit_pattern` is unhelpful/broken (uses fixed masks instead of copying input; do not use). The output canvas init and placement logic (r0/c0 calculation) is helpful/accurate for framing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Assumed input has solid 5x5 blocks where color value encodes the digit type, and rendered fixed 5x5 masks filled with that color; this is incorrect—inputs have pre-patterned 5x5 shapes to copy directly.
 * Detection failed to find actual blocks (or found none, but results show it ran with defaults/fallbacks), leading to no blocks or wrong positions in some cases.
 * Fixed masks were partially correct (e.g., for 2,6,8,9 matched expected patterns by coincidence in some trains) but wrong for 1,3,4 (e.g., train1 '1' generated row2: c bg bg c c but expected c bg bg bg c; row4: c bg bg bg c expected same but mismatched elsewhere; train2 '4' not present but would mismatch).
 * For train1: Generated '1' pattern wrong (row2:1 8 8 1 1 vs expected 1 8 8 8 1; row3:1 1 8 1 1 matches; row4:1 8 8 8 1 matches); '6' and bottom '4' patterns correct by mask luck; overall incorrect due to '1' and partial '4' (generated row3 for '4':4 8 8 8 4 vs expected 4 8 4 8 4; row4:4 4 8 4 4 vs expected 4 8 4 8 4).
 * For train2: '1' pattern accidentally matched expected (row2:1 4 4 1 1, row3:1 1 4 1 1, row4:1 4 4 4 1); '2' matched fully; '3' wrong (solid all-3 vs expected patterned like row2:3 4 3 4 3, row3:3 4 4 4 3, row4:3 3 4 4 3); incorrect due to missing/wrong '3' handling.
 * For train3: Upper layer ('8','4')—'8' matched expected fully; '4' wrong (generated row2:4 1 4 1 4 vs expected 4 1 1 1 4? Wait, expected row2 for '4':4 1 4 1 4 matches code but human expected lists row2:4 1 4 1 4 1, yes partial match but row3:4 1 1 1 4 vs generated 4 1 1 1 4? Actually mismatches in details like row4 for '4': generated 4 4 1 4 4 vs expected 4 4 1 4 4 matches, but overall listed as incorrect—likely due to lower layer); lower layer '3' solid/wrong (all 3 vs expected row2:3 1 1 1 3, row3:3 3 1 3 3, row4:3 3 1 3 3); '9' matched expected fully.
 * Grouping and framing worked well (positions/spacing correct across all trains, e.g., horizontal pairs in train3, triple in train2, single-row triple? in train1).
 * Default mask (all filled) used for missing digits like 3, leading to solid blocks instead of patterns.
 * No handling for varying patterns per "digit" across examples (e.g., '1' shape differs between train1 and train2, proving copy-input not fixed-render).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it renders fixed mask-based patterns (e.g., upper layer presumed '4' and '8': '4' uses code's mask row2:4 3 3 3 4? Wait, bg=3, c=4 for first: row2:4 3 4 3 4 vs likely input pattern like train2's '4' but unknown; '8' row2:8 3 3 8 8 matches standard but may not copy input; lower '2' and '1': '2' matches standard but input likely has custom; '1' uses wrong mask row2:1 3 3 1 1 vs possible input variant; bottom '6' and '9' match standards but again not copied).
 * It is missing exact replication of input 5x5 patterns (e.g., if test input '1' has train1-style row2:1 3 3 3 1, generated has 1 3 3 1 1—different); solid-like for any unmasked digits.
 * Generated assumes solid detection (likely found no/mis blocks or fallback), but positions suggest it detected something; overall wrong because it doesn't copy input patterns, leading to mismatches like train examples.
 * To handle test: Update detection to find patterned 5x5 (using improved `find_digit_blocks`), copy subgrids directly; account for 3 layers (upper '4''8', mid '2''1', lower '6''9'?) with bg=3; ensure non-bg count filter avoids false positives.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where input grids contain multiple 5x5 solid uniform-color blocks (non-background) arranged in horizontal layers, each representing a digit (1,2,3,4,6,8,9), and the goal is to generate an output grid that replaces each solid block with its corresponding 5x5 patterned pixel-art representation of the digit, arranged in the same relative positions but embedded in a larger grid with background borders, row separators, and column separators between digits in the same layer. The output preserves the layered structure, with each layer of digits separated vertically by a full background row, and digits within a layer separated horizontally by a single background column.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (b) is always the value at g[0][0] and fills all non-pattern areas, including full borders around the entire output, single-column separators between digits in the same row/layer, and full-row separators (height 1) between layers.
 * Solid blocks are exactly 5x5 uniform non-background pixels; they must be detected precisely without overlapping detection issues, and only these are replaced—any non-solid or background areas remain unchanged in concept but are reconstructed in the output layout.
 * Blocks are grouped into "layers" if their starting rows differ by less than 5 (indicating horizontal alignment/overlap in the same "row" of the puzzle), and within each layer, blocks are sorted left-to-right by starting column.
 * Output dimensions are calculated as height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (accounting for 5 pattern rows + 1 separator per layer, plus top/bottom borders), width = 6 * max_digits_per_layer + 1 (5 pattern cols + 1 separator per digit, plus left/right borders); patterns start at offsets (1,1) per block with incremental positioning.
 * Digit patterns are fixed 5x5 binary masks (1=on/pixel color, 0=off/background), but the color of the digit is the uniform color of the detected solid block (c), not a fixed value—off pixels use b.
 * No support for digits 0,5,7 (masks only for 1,2,3,4,6,8,9); unknown digits default to solid, but this may cause issues if other digits appear.
 * Input grids have top/bottom/middle full background rows separating layers, and blocks do not overlap between layers.
 * Subtle: Patterns must exactly match expected pixel-art shapes (e.g., '1' is a vertical bar with serifs or specific offsets, not symmetric); mismatches in mask definitions lead to pixel-level differences.
 * If no blocks, output should be a background-filled grid of original size, but in practice, examples always have blocks.
 * Horizontal positioning in output assumes sorted left-to-right, with separators only between digits (no leading/trailing extras beyond borders).
 * Vertical positioning starts at row 1 for first layer, increments by 6 per layer (5 pattern +1 sep).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The core detection of 5x5 solid blocks via find_solid_blocks worked correctly, as it identified the right positions and colors for all blocks in training examples (no missed or false positives noted).
 * Grouping into horizontal layers via group_blocks worked well, correctly separating layers (e.g., in example 1, three separate layers for 1,6,4; in example 3, three layers with two digits each).
 * Output layout construction (borders, separators, positioning) was mostly correct: proper height/width calc, vertical stacking with 6-row increments, horizontal sorting and 6-col increments per digit, leading to correct overall structure and spacing in all examples.
 * Training example 2 was fully correct, indicating the block detection, grouping, and layout handle simple cases (likely single-layer or matching patterns) perfectly.
 * digit_masks were fundamentally incorrect, causing pixel-level mismatches in patterns: e.g., in training 1, '1' generated had wide base and misplaced pixels (row2:1,0,0,1,1 vs expected narrow right:0,0,0,0,1; row3:1,1,0,1,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1; row4:1,0,0,0,1 vs 0,0,0,0,1), '6' had wrong curve (row4:1,0,1,1,1 vs expected 1,0,1,0,1?), '4' mismatched crossbar/legs; similar issues in training 3 for '8' (row4:1,1,1,0,1 vs expected ?), '4' legs wrong, '3' curve off (row3:1,1,0,0,1 vs 1,0,0,0,1?), '9' top/bottom wrong.
 * get_digit_pattern is helpful but broken due to bad masks; it correctly applies c/b but uses wrong binary shapes, leading to all pattern failures except possibly '2' or cases where mask accidentally matched.
 * program main function is mostly solid (handles empty grid, iterates groups correctly) but inherits mask errors; no issues with background filling or size.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (find_solid_blocks, group_blocks, get_digit_pattern) are relevant, though masks need full correction from expected patterns.
 * Subtle miss: Assumes digit identity from block color (c as key), which works if colors map uniquely to digits, but patterns must be standard 7-segment-like or puzzle-specific (inferred from diffs: asymmetric, like LCD/LED digits).
 * Training 1 and 3 failed entirely due to pattern mismatches, not layout—e.g., train1 generated symmetric/wrong '1' (left-heavy), train3 swapped pixels in '4' row3 (1,1,4,1,4 vs expected 1,0,0,0,1? wait, actually from diff: generated row3 for first '4':4,1,4,1,4 but expected 4,1,1,1,4? No, looking closely: mismatches are specific pixel flips, e.g., train3 '4' row3 generated [4,1,1,1,4,1] wait no, the shown is per row but aggregated.
 * extract_objects not present, but find_solid_blocks serves as essential for identifying "objects" (blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct, as it replicates the same pattern errors from training 1/3: e.g., top layer '4' and '8' show wide/misplaced pixels (row2 for '4':[4,3,3,3,4,3] wait, no—shown as [3,4,4,4,4,4,3,8,8,8,8,8,3] for row1, but row3:[3,4,3,4,3,4,3,8,3,3,8,8,3] indicates wrong mask for '4' (expected narrow or specific from train3 '4'), '8' has off-curve; middle layer '2' and '1' mismatch (row3 for '2':[2,3,3,2,2,3] vs likely expected curved top; '1' row4:[1,3,3,3,1,3] wrong stem); bottom '6' and '9' have similar curve/flip errors as train1 '6'.
 * It correctly detects and places 6 blocks in 3 layers (two per layer, like train3), with proper borders/separators and background 3, but patterns are invalid (e.g., '1' not narrow vertical, '9' row4:[9,9,3,9,9,3] vs expected from train3 [9,1,1,9,9,1] adjusted).
 * Test input has layers separated by background rows (rows 0,6,12 full 3; blocks at rows1-5,7-11,13-17), solid 5x5 of colors 4/8 top, 2/1 middle, 6/9 bottom—output structure matches this, but patterns do not, so it fails like train1/3.
 * To fix for test, correct all masks to match inferred expected (e.g., '1' right-aligned stem, '4' open top with cross, etc.); without this, test will always mismatch pixel-by-pixel.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains solid 5x5 blocks of uniform non-background colors representing digits, and the goal is to extract these blocks, group them into horizontal layers based on row proximity, interpret each block's color as a digit, replace each block with a predefined 5x5 pixel-art pattern for that digit (filled with the digit color against background), and arrange the patterns in a compact output grid with background borders and separators between layers and blocks. The output compacts the input by rendering only the stylized digit patterns in aligned layers, preserving the relative horizontal ordering within layers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is strictly the top-left grid value (grid[0][0]), and all non-solid-5x5 or background-matching areas are ignored in the output.
 * Blocks must be exactly 5x5 and entirely uniform in a single non-background color; overlapping or partial blocks are not considered—only perfect solid squares trigger detection.
 * Grouping into layers uses row-start differences: blocks are sorted by starting row then column, and grouped if consecutive starting rows differ by less than 5 (indicating same "layer" alignment, even if slightly offset vertically); within groups, sort by starting column for horizontal order.
 * Digit patterns are 5x5 binary masks (1=on/fill with block color, 0=off/background), but the predefined masks must exactly match the expected stylized shapes for digits like 1,2,3,4,6,8,9—current masks are approximate but fail to reproduce training expectations precisely.
 * Output grid dimensions: height = 6 * num_layers + 1 (1 top border + 5 pattern rows + 1 separator per layer), width = 6 * max_blocks_per_layer + 1 (1 left border + 5 pattern cols + 1 separator per block); entire grid initializes to background, with patterns placed at offsets (row: 1 + layer_idx*6, col: 1 + pos*6).
 * Separators and borders are single rows/columns of pure background, ensuring visual distinction between layers (horizontal separator rows) and blocks (vertical separator columns); no trimming or adjustment for empty layers.
 * If no blocks found, output mirrors the original grid (padded if needed, but preserves dimensions and content).
 * Colors are integers (e.g., 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 as digits), and patterns must be symmetric or stylized to match "pixel-art" digits—subtle pixel placements (e.g., exact positions of "off" pixels in curves or lines) are critical and often mismatched.
 * Horizontal alignment in output preserves input order within layers, but vertical offsets in input are collapsed—layers are strictly stacked with fixed spacing.
 * Only digits 1-9 (skipping 5,7,0?) are handled; fallback to full solid 5x5 if undefined, but this isn't triggered in examples.
 * Potential overlaps or adjacent blocks in input don't merge—each 5x5 is independent, but detection skips if starting position would overlap prior checks (sliding window from top-left).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; core detection and grouping logic works for training example 3 (correct output), demonstrating understanding of block extraction, layering, and compact arrangement.
 * Failed training example 1: Generated patterns for digits 1,6,4 have pixel mismatches—e.g., digit 1 row 2 has [1,8,8,1,1] but expected [1,8,8,8,1]; digit 6 row 3 has [6,8,8,6,6] but expected [6,8,6,8,6]; digit 4 row 4 has [4,4,8,4,4] but expected [4,8,4,8,4]—likely due to incorrect mask definitions not matching expected stylized digits.
 * Failed training example 2: Similar mask issues—digit 1 row 2 [1,4,4,1,1] vs expected [1,4,4,1,1] (close but row 3 [1,1,4,1,1] vs [1,1,4,1,1]? Wait, mismatches in digit 2 row 4 [2,4,2,4,2] vs expected [2,4,4,2,2]; digit 3 row 2 [3,4,4,4,3] vs [3,4,3,4,3]—exact pixel placements off, causing "off-by-one" in curves/lines.
 * Grouping and positioning worked in all (e.g., correct layer separation and horizontal order), but empty areas and borders are properly bg-filled.
 * detect_solid_5x5_blocks is essential and correct—accurately finds blocks without false positives.
 * group_blocks_by_row_alignment handles subtle vertical offsets (<5 rows) as same layer, which is key for aligned but not perfectly row-matched blocks.
 * Output sizing and placement logic is solid, producing correct dimensions and no overlaps.
 * Issue: Masks are the core failure point—attempt assumes generic shapes but training shows specific, non-standard pixel-art (e.g., digit 4 lacks crossbar in expected); unknown why shapes differ, but must reverse-engineer from expectations.
 * No omission of blocks or layers; handles multiple per layer correctly.
 * Fallback to original grid if no blocks is unused but correct.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output follows the program's logic: detects blocks for colors 4 and 8 in layer 0 (rows ~1-5 start), 2 and 1 in layer 1 (rows ~7-11), 6 and 9 in layer 2 (rows ~13-17); arranges in 3 layers with max 2 blocks/layer, producing 19x13 grid with borders/separators.
 * Patterns use the flawed masks, so likely incorrect—e.g., digit 4 row 2 [4,3,4,3,4] suggests mask mismatch similar to training 1/2 (expected might have different "open" positions based on patterns); digit 8 row 3 [8,3,3,8,8] vs potential expected with more symmetry.
 * Structure makes sense (layers stacked, horizontal order preserved, bg separators), but pixel details probably wrong—e.g., digit 1 in layer 1 row 9 [1,3,3,1,1] may not match a clean vertical stem; overall, output is compact and layered correctly but patterns don't look like standard digits (jagged/ asymmetric due to bad masks).
 * Does not look fully correct: While layout is plausible, the specific pixel "on/off" in patterns (e.g., digit 9 row 15 [9,3,3,9,9] with unexpected fills) deviates from training expectations, suggesting same mask issue persists; test likely expects precise shapes to "read" as digits visually.
 * Accounts for multi-layer with varying block counts, but if input has offset rows within <5, grouping is handled—output visually separates layers well, but without expected test grid, can't confirm block detection accuracy.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 11:56:11] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid containing multiple embedded 5x5 patterns (shapes or icons made of a single non-background color on a background, possibly with internal background "holes" or empty spaces), and the output is a new grid that extracts and stacks these patterns vertically in a compact format, each separated by a single background row, with 1-cell background borders around each pattern to form 7x7 blocks, arranged in the order they appear in the input (likely by vertical position or discovery order).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are exactly 5x5 in size but are not solid blocks; they consist of a single color placed on the background in specific shapes (e.g., plus signs, letters, or icons with internal background spaces), so detection must identify regions where non-background cells are all the same color but allow for background holes inside the 5x5 bounding box.
 * Background color (bg) is determined from the top-left cell (g[0][0]), assumed consistent; all patterns use distinct colors different from bg.
 * Patterns do not overlap and are separated by at least 1 bg cell; they must be detected by scanning for exact 5x5 subgrids where all non-bg cells share one color, and non_bg_count > 0 (to avoid empty bg areas).
 * Output stacking: Patterns are stacked vertically (one per "layer"), each in its own 7x7 framed section (5x5 pattern + 1-cell bg border on all sides), with a 1-row bg separator between layers; no horizontal arrangement within layers—each layer has exactly one pattern centered or placed at position (1,1) relative to its frame.
 * Order of stacking: Likely by the topmost row of each pattern's position in the input (vertical scan order), not by color or horizontal position.
 * Dimensions: Output height = 7 * num_patterns (for frames) + (num_patterns - 1) * 1 (separators); width = 7 (fixed, as each frame is 7 wide); if no patterns, return the input unchanged or a bg-filled grid of input size.
 * Subtle elements: Ignore scattered single cells or non-5x5 regions; patterns may be adjacent vertically but should be treated as separate if row starts differ by >=5; do not fill internal pattern spaces with bg during extraction—copy the exact 5x5 subgrid as-is; the input may have extra bg padding, but output is always compact and square-ish per pattern.
 * Edge cases: Input may have varying sizes; if patterns span multiple rows/columns beyond 5x5, they are invalid (but examples suggest exact 5x5); multiple patterns of same color possible but treated separately; test input likely has ~5-6 patterns of colors like 1,2,4,6,8,9 on bg=3, stacked in input row order.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

    """Extract background color from top-left cell. Helpful for distinguishing patterns."""

    but misses shape validation (e.g., connected components) and over-detects if patterns have irregular bounds.

```python
def group_blocks(blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:

    if not blocks:
        return []
    sorted_blocks = sorted(set(blocks), key=lambda x: x[0])  # Unique by position, sort by row
    return sorted_blocks  # Return as list of single-block "groups" for vertical stacking
```

The following functions from the attempt are broken or not helpful:
- `compute_output_dimensions`: Computes oversized width based on max_per_layer (assumes horizontal placement), but output should be fixed 7-wide with vertical stacking only; leads to huge unnecessary grids.
- `place_pattern`: Places multiple blocks horizontally per layer with 6-cell spacing, but examples show single pattern per layer, centered in 7x7; overcomplicates and misplaces.
- Overall `program`: If no blocks, returns bg-filled input (correct), but block detection works partially (finds candidates), grouping assumes row-clusters with horizontal layout (wrong), and output is flattened/messy lists instead of proper 2D grid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but all three training examples failed completely.
 * Train 1: Detected some blocks (e.g., placed partial 1,6,4 shapes) but output is a massive ~200+ cell flat list then oversized 2D grids with patterns scattered horizontally across multiple layers instead of stacked vertically in 7x7 frames; missed compact stacking and added extra bg rows/columns; shapes are copied but distorted (e.g., 1's pattern is incomplete, missing exact plus shape from expected).
 * Train 2: Output is enormous bg=4 filled grids with patterns like 1's,2's,3's placed in wrong positions/sizes (e.g., 1's block is 5x5 but stretched horizontally; 3's pattern has extra 4's bg inside); ignored input's multi-pattern horizontal layout, resulting in vertical mess instead of expected single-layer 19x7 with three side-by-side 5x5-ish patterns framed by 4's.
 * Train 3: Generated huge 1-filled (bg?) grids with patterns like 8's,3's,4's,9's overlaid but fragmented (e.g., 8's block is partial, not full shape; multiple duplicates); stacking is vertical but with wrong spacing (no 1-row separators, oversized frames); missed expected 13x13 compact grid with two side-by-side pattern pairs per layer.
 * `group_blocks` over-groups horizontally (sorts by col within row groups), leading to multi-pattern layers; should group vertically only and select one per pattern.
 * `find_blocks` is somewhat helpful (correctly identifies single-color 5x5 regions with holes) but detects too many/overlaps in dense inputs; doesn't validate if the pattern is "connected" or exact shape match.
 * Output format issue: Returns flat lists or oversized 2D, but expected is exact 2D grids (e.g., Train 1: 19 rows x 7 cols); program ignores input dimensions for empty case correctly but bloat for non-empty.
 * No color-based sorting; patterns stacked by input position, but attempt doesn't preserve order properly (sorts by (r,c) but places in wrong layout).
 * Unhelpful: Horizontal placement assumes multiple per row, but examples have at most 2-3 side-by-side in input, stacked as singles in output.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in this attempt; it generates five huge ~100+ cell rows filled mostly with bg=3, with scattered partial patterns (e.g., 1's,2's,4's,6's,8's,9's blocks appear but fragmented, oversized, and placed horizontally across wide grids instead of vertically stacked 7x7 frames); for example, a 6's pattern is copied multiple times with distortions (missing connections), and 1's/9's are squished; no compact 7-wide stacking with separators, resulting in a bloated, unreadable grid unlike the clean vertical arrangement expected for ~5-6 patterns on bg=3 (likely colors 1,2,4,6,8,9 in row order, each in 7x7 frame, total height ~40-50, width 7).
 * Differences: Expected would be vertical stack (e.g., top pattern at rows 0-6, next at 8-14, etc., all 7-wide); generated has horizontal sprawl (width 20+), extra bg padding, and incomplete shapes (e.g., 2's block has only 2-3 cells instead of full 5x5 shape); test input (inferred from generated) has patterns like vertical bars (6's), crosses (4's?), but output mangles them by over-copying subregions.
 * Why not correct: Block detection finds candidates but grouping/placement assumes multi-horizontal layers (from max_per_layer=3+), creating wide output; doesn't center single patterns in 7x7 or add exact separators; likely misses test's denser packing or specific shape subtleties (e.g., diagonal or sparse patterns).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 11:57:10] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 12:00:06] Response:
- **Large filled square components (25 pixels, 0 holes, various colors)** consistently interact with small non-background components (pixels <25, 0 holes, various colors) such that portions of the square's area are subtracted, resulting in: reduced pixels (18-20 per square), added holes (1-3 per square), same color preserved, and same bounding box (or repositioned to a standard left/central alignment in vertical stack cases). The subtracted pixel amount per square equals the total pixels of new small background-colored components appearing within that square's bounding box.
- **Small non-background components (pixels 1-7, 0 holes)** consistently disappear from their input positions and contribute to the subtraction in the large squares (as above); exact mapping of which small component affects which square is position-dependent (e.g., proximity or dropping direction), but the total subtracted pixels match the sum of selected small components' pixels per square (unknown rule for selection when totals exceed needed amount).
- **Background component (large bbox covering image, high holes 11-17, pixels ~250-290, color Maroon/Yellow/Blue)** consistently interacts with the overall layout of large squares by having its bounding box reduced to a strip or block adjacent to/unoccupied by the squares (e.g., left vertical for stacked squares, top horizontal for row, top-left square for grid), holes reduced to 3-4, and pixels reduced to 58-69; color preserved.
- **Position property** consistently affects transformation: small components' relative positions to large squares determine the positions of new background-colored subtracted components within the squares' bboxes (e.g., shifted upward or aligned centrally); large squares' input positions may affect output background bbox shape but preserve relative arrangement.
- **Pixel count property** consistently links subtractions: total pixels subtracted from all large squares equals total pixels of all new small background-colored components across outputs.
- **Hole count property** consistently increases in large squares post-interaction (0 to 1-3) due to subtractions creating enclosures; background holes decrease due to bbox reduction removing some enclosed areas (exact mechanism unknown).
- **Color property** consistently preserved for large squares and background; new small components always take the background's color, regardless of original small components' colors.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 12:00:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Large filled square components (25 pixels, 0 holes, various colors)** consistently interact with small non-background components (pixels <25, 0 holes, various colors) such that portions of the square's area are subtracted, resulting in: reduced pixels (18-20 per square), added holes (1-3 per square), same color preserved, and same bounding box (or repositioned to a standard left/central alignment in vertical stack cases). The subtracted pixel amount per square equals the total pixels of new small background-colored components appearing within that square's bounding box.
- **Small non-background components (pixels 1-7, 0 holes)** consistently disappear from their input positions and contribute to the subtraction in the large squares (as above); exact mapping of which small component affects which square is position-dependent (e.g., proximity or dropping direction), but the total subtracted pixels match the sum of selected small components' pixels per square (unknown rule for selection when totals exceed needed amount).
- **Background component (large bbox covering image, high holes 11-17, pixels ~250-290, color Maroon/Yellow/Blue)** consistently interacts with the overall layout of large squares by having its bounding box reduced to a strip or block adjacent to/unoccupied by the squares (e.g., left vertical for stacked squares, top horizontal for row, top-left square for grid), holes reduced to 3-4, and pixels reduced to 58-69; color preserved.
- **Position property** consistently affects transformation: small components' relative positions to large squares determine the positions of new background-colored subtracted components within the squares' bboxes (e.g., shifted upward or aligned centrally); large squares' input positions may affect output background bbox shape but preserve relative arrangement.
- **Pixel count property** consistently links subtractions: total pixels subtracted from all large squares equals total pixels of all new small background-colored components across outputs.
- **Hole count property** consistently increases in large squares post-interaction (0 to 1-3) due to subtractions creating enclosures; background holes decrease due to bbox reduction removing some enclosed areas (exact mechanism unknown).
- **Color property** consistently preserved for large squares and background; new small components always take the background's color, regardless of original small components' colors.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:07:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where the background color is determined by the top-left cell, and the goal is to identify connected components (4-directional) of non-background colors, distinguish "large" components (exactly 25 cells, implying solid 5x5 squares) from "small" components (fewer cells), erase the small components to background, and then "punch" or subtract the shape of the small components (centered) from their matching large 5x5 component as background holes, producing a modified grid cropped to the bounding area of the large components with some extensions if they align horizontally or vertically.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is always grid[0][0], and components are only non-background cells connected via 4 directions (up, down, left, right—no diagonals).
 * Large components must be exactly 25 cells to qualify as 5x5 bases for punching; anything else is treated as small, even if same color and adjacent.
 * Small components per color are collected across the grid and erased entirely to background before punching.
 * Punching centers the small shape's bounding box within a new 5x5 template (using integer division for offset, e.g., (5 - h_s)//2), filling non-small positions with the color and small positions with background, then overlays this exactly on the large component's minr/minc position (assuming larges are axis-aligned 5x5 blocks).
 * If no smalls for a color's large, the large remains solid; if no large for smalls, smalls are just erased.
 * Output cropping considers all large components: if all larges share the exact same row range, extend output rows by 1 above min and below max; same for columns if shared col range; otherwise, start from 0 or end at grid edge. Clamp to grid bounds. This can result in outputs including spacers or full-width if larges are misaligned.
 * Subtlety: Multiple larges per color aren't handled (code assumes one large per color via dict); if multiples, only the first-detected large gets punched, which could fail if puzzle has duplicates.
 * Subtlety: Component finding uses stack (DFS) and tracks visited to avoid revisits, but assumes grid is rectangular; empty grid returns empty.
 * Key: Punching repositions the "hole" mask relative to the large's top-left, not the smalls' absolute positions—smalls can be anywhere, but holes are centered in the 5x5.
 * Easy to miss: Output may include unmodified larges or background spacers between blocks if larges are separated; cropping might exclude outer backgrounds if not extended.
 * Considerations: Grid may have multiple colors, each processed independently; test grids seem to have paired colors (e.g., 4 with 8? but code treats per color); no rotation or scaling of smalls—just direct mask transfer centered.
 * All cells in components must be same color; bg != color strictly.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; no prior ones mentioned, but the program as a whole worked correctly for all three training examples (full match on expected outputs).
 * What worked: Accurate component detection via flood-fill, correct separation of small/large by size==25, proper erasure of smalls, centered punching of small masks into 5x5 larges, and intelligent cropping that extends bounds for aligned larges (likely key for training cases with spaced blocks).
 * What didn't work: Unknown if test handles multiple larges per color (code overwrites dict, using only one); potential issue if small bounding box >5x5 (code doesn't check, but //2 centering might clip); assumes larges are exactly at minr/minc as 5x5—no validation if large isn't rectangular 5x5.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (find_components, process_smalls_and_larges, get_output_bounds) are core and relevant—find_components is essential for extracting objects, process handles the punching logic correctly as evidenced by training passes.
 * Subtle win: Visited matrix prevents double-counting in DFS; defaultdict for smalls collects all fragments per color.

**Test output:**
 * The test output appears as an 18-row grid (with some rows like [3]*23 as spacers), featuring three vertical blocks of modified 5x5 patterns separated by background 3's: top (rows ~1-5, cols ~11-20) shows punched 4's (left) and 8's (right) with internal 3 holes matching small shapes; middle (rows ~7-11) punched 2's and 1's; bottom (rows ~13-17) punched 6's and 9's; full-width 3 rows separate blocks.
 * It makes sense and looks correct based on rules: Multiple color pairs (e.g., 4/8 as separate colors, each with smalls punched into their larges), erasure of smalls leaves clean bg, punching creates visible hole patterns (e.g., top-left 4-block has solid top/bottom but holes in middle rows), and cropping includes extended spacers (likely same-col alignment triggers col extension, but rows not since vertical stack). No obvious errors like unpunched solids or wrong bounds—patterns align to 5x5 with centered holes, and output includes the full relevant area without extraneous parts. If incorrect, it might be minor overflow in punching if smalls >5 cells wide, but observed holes fit neatly (e.g., irregular shapes in 4's and 8's match expected small transfers).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 12:07:34] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, position, holes, pixels, bbox) and components (e.g., background frame, large shapes, small shapes) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific small shape silhouettes without cross-example ties, inconsistent color pairings) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact matching rules) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Background Frame → Output Frame and Small Output Elements (Color and Size Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: The large, high-holes background element in input (full-canvas bbox like [0,0,18,18] or [0,0,22,18], pixels ~247-293, holes 11-17, colors: Maroon/Yellow/Blue across examples).
   - **Interaction**: Its color directly determines the color of the output frame (a resized, lower-holes enclosure) and all small output elements (non-large shapes). 
     - Output frame: Same color, reduced holes (consistently 3-4), smaller bbox enclosing the arranged large shapes with a 1-unit border (e.g., height/width expanded by 2 units total for border; specific: [0,0,6,18] for vertical stack, [0,0,18,6] for horizontal, [0,0,12,12] for 2x2 grid), pixels ~58-69.
     - Small output elements: Recolored to background color, preserving input pixel counts for those not used elsewhere (see below).
   - **Affected Properties**: Color (preserved and propagated); bbox (resized based on large shape arrangement); holes (reduced, but exact rule unknown); pixels (reduced, consistent range).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains; no exceptions. Position of background (full canvas) consistently leads to output frame positioning at canvas edges.

#### 2. **Large Shapes ↔ Small Shapes (Pixel Reduction and Hole Creation in Large Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: 
     - Large shapes: Consistent 5x5 bbox ([x,x+4,y,y+4]), 25 pixels, 0 holes (colors vary: Blue/Pink/Yellow in train 1; Blue/Red/Green in train 2; Maroon/Yellow/Green/Light Blue in train 3).
     - Small shapes: All other non-background, non-large elements (<25 pixels, 0 holes, various colors, scattered bboxes).
   - **Interaction**: Pixel counts from specific small shapes are subtracted from large shapes' 25 pixels, creating holes in the large shapes. Unused small shapes' pixel counts are preserved but recolored (to background color) and placed as small elements in output.
     - Large transformation: Reduced to ~18-20 pixels (diffs consistently 5-7, matching exact pixel counts from input small shapes); holes added (1-3, exact count unknown—possibly number of applied smalls, but not verifiable); bbox preserved as 5x5; color preserved.
     - Small transformation: Pixel counts of non-applied smalls become output small elements (same pixel value, background color, small bboxes); applied smalls disappear from output (their pixels "consumed" for large reduction).
     - Total small pixel sum in input ≈ sum of large reductions + sum of output small pixels (rough match within 1-2 pixels across examples, suggesting all small pixels are accounted for via this split).
   - **Affected Properties**: Pixels (small pixels → large pixel reduction; exact matching of which small to which large unknown); holes (added to large only, value unknown); color (smalls recolored to background; larges unchanged).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains; every large shape is reduced by small pixel values present in input, and output smalls match remaining input small pixel values (e.g., 7,5,7 in train 1; 6,6,7 in train 2; 5,6,5,5 in train 3). No large shape lacks this interaction.

#### 3. **Large Shapes' Input Position → Output Position/Arrangement**
   - **Components Involved**: Large shapes (as defined above).
   - **Interaction**: Relative positions/orientation of large shapes in input determine their layout in output (preserving relative stacking/grid while normalizing to left/top-aligned).
     - Examples: Vertical right-aligned in train 1 → vertical left stack in output; horizontal top row in train 2 → horizontal top row (same positions); 2x2 grid in train 3 → same 2x2 grid positions.
     - Bbox shifts consistently to align with output frame (e.g., x=1-5 or y=1-5 starts), but relative offsets preserved (e.g., 6-unit vertical gaps become 6-unit in output).
   - **Affected Properties**: Bbox (position shifted/arranged based on input relative positions; no size change); interacts with background frame bbox (output frame resizes to fit this arrangement + border).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains; every set of large shapes shows position-based rearrangement relative to input, without rotation or overlap. No exceptions.

#### Unknown or Non-Consistent Aspects Noted
- Exact rule for which small shape pixels apply to which large shape (e.g., by color match, proximity, or order): Unknown; cannot be determined from data without forcing inconsistent assumptions.
- How holes count (1-3 in larges) is calculated beyond "added via small application": Unknown; not tied to a single property like small pixels or count.
- Role of 1-pixel small shapes: Often preserved in output smalls, but no unique interaction beyond pixel reduction.
- Edges/silhouettes of shapes: No consistent effect on movement/transformation (e.g., polyomino types like L/U not observably linked across examples).
- Any position → color changes: None consistent (e.g., no reliable "right position → specific color shift").
- Hole count → other properties: Input holes=0 for all non-background; output holes only in larges and frame—no cross-effect.

No other interactions (e.g., direct small-to-small, color-to-position beyond background, or inconsistent pixel thresholds) are consistent across all three trains. Elements without these ties (e.g., isolated 1-pixel outliers not matching reductions) are irrelevant per criteria.

[2025-10-03 12:10:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, position, holes, pixels, bbox) and components (e.g., background frame, large shapes, small shapes) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., specific small shape silhouettes without cross-example ties, inconsistent color pairings) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact matching rules) are noted as such.

#### 1. **Background Frame → Output Frame and Small Output Elements (Color and Size Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: The large, high-holes background element in input (full-canvas bbox like [0,0,18,18] or [0,0,22,18], pixels ~247-293, holes 11-17, colors: Maroon/Yellow/Blue across examples).
   - **Interaction**: Its color directly determines the color of the output frame (a resized, lower-holes enclosure) and all small output elements (non-large shapes). 
     - Output frame: Same color, reduced holes (consistently 3-4), smaller bbox enclosing the arranged large shapes with a 1-unit border (e.g., height/width expanded by 2 units total for border; specific: [0,0,6,18] for vertical stack, [0,0,18,6] for horizontal, [0,0,12,12] for 2x2 grid), pixels ~58-69.
     - Small output elements: Recolored to background color, preserving input pixel counts for those not used elsewhere (see below).
   - **Affected Properties**: Color (preserved and propagated); bbox (resized based on large shape arrangement); holes (reduced, but exact rule unknown); pixels (reduced, consistent range).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains; no exceptions. Position of background (full canvas) consistently leads to output frame positioning at canvas edges.

#### 2. **Large Shapes ↔ Small Shapes (Pixel Reduction and Hole Creation in Large Shapes)**
   - **Components Involved**: 
     - Large shapes: Consistent 5x5 bbox ([x,x+4,y,y+4]), 25 pixels, 0 holes (colors vary: Blue/Pink/Yellow in train 1; Blue/Red/Green in train 2; Maroon/Yellow/Green/Light Blue in train 3).
     - Small shapes: All other non-background, non-large elements (<25 pixels, 0 holes, various colors, scattered bboxes).
   - **Interaction**: Pixel counts from specific small shapes are subtracted from large shapes' 25 pixels, creating holes in the large shapes. Unused small shapes' pixel counts are preserved but recolored (to background color) and placed as small elements in output.
     - Large transformation: Reduced to ~18-20 pixels (diffs consistently 5-7, matching exact pixel counts from input small shapes); holes added (1-3, exact count unknown—possibly number of applied smalls, but not verifiable); bbox preserved as 5x5; color preserved.
     - Small transformation: Pixel counts of non-applied smalls become output small elements (same pixel value, background color, small bboxes); applied smalls disappear from output (their pixels "consumed" for large reduction).
     - Total small pixel sum in input ≈ sum of large reductions + sum of output small pixels (rough match within 1-2 pixels across examples, suggesting all small pixels are accounted for via this split).
   - **Affected Properties**: Pixels (small pixels → large pixel reduction; exact matching of which small to which large unknown); holes (added to large only, value unknown); color (smalls recolored to background; larges unchanged).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains; every large shape is reduced by small pixel values present in input, and output smalls match remaining input small pixel values (e.g., 7,5,7 in train 1; 6,6,7 in train 2; 5,6,5,5 in train 3). No large shape lacks this interaction.

#### 3. **Large Shapes' Input Position → Output Position/Arrangement**
   - **Components Involved**: Large shapes (as defined above).
   - **Interaction**: Relative positions/orientation of large shapes in input determine their layout in output (preserving relative stacking/grid while normalizing to left/top-aligned).
     - Examples: Vertical right-aligned in train 1 → vertical left stack in output; horizontal top row in train 2 → horizontal top row (same positions); 2x2 grid in train 3 → same 2x2 grid positions.
     - Bbox shifts consistently to align with output frame (e.g., x=1-5 or y=1-5 starts), but relative offsets preserved (e.g., 6-unit vertical gaps become 6-unit in output).
   - **Affected Properties**: Bbox (position shifted/arranged based on input relative positions; no size change); interacts with background frame bbox (output frame resizes to fit this arrangement + border).
   - **Consistency**: Observed in all three trains; every set of large shapes shows position-based rearrangement relative to input, without rotation or overlap. No exceptions.

#### Unknown or Non-Consistent Aspects Noted
- Exact rule for which small shape pixels apply to which large shape (e.g., by color match, proximity, or order): Unknown; cannot be determined from data without forcing inconsistent assumptions.
- How holes count (1-3 in larges) is calculated beyond "added via small application": Unknown; not tied to a single property like small pixels or count.
- Role of 1-pixel small shapes: Often preserved in output smalls, but no unique interaction beyond pixel reduction.
- Edges/silhouettes of shapes: No consistent effect on movement/transformation (e.g., polyomino types like L/U not observably linked across examples).
- Any position → color changes: None consistent (e.g., no reliable "right position → specific color shift").
- Hole count → other properties: Input holes=0 for all non-background; output holes only in larges and frame—no cross-effect.

No other interactions (e.g., direct small-to-small, color-to-position beyond background, or inconsistent pixel thresholds) are consistent across all three trains. Elements without these ties (e.g., isolated 1-pixel outliers not matching reductions) are irrelevant per criteria.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:19:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains multiple distinct 5x5 patterns (objects or "shapes") composed of a single non-background color with specific background "holes" (empty spaces) forming intricate designs (possibly resembling letters, symbols, or figures), all embedded in a uniform background. The goal of the program is to detect and extract each of these 5x5 patterns exactly as they appear (preserving the precise positions of color cells and background holes), then rearrange them into a new output grid where each pattern is isolated within a padded 7x7 frame (1-cell background border on all sides), with patterns stacked vertically (for vertically arranged inputs like training examples 1 and 3) or placed side-by-side horizontally (for horizontal arrangements like training example 2), merging adjacent background borders to avoid extra spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Each pattern is exactly 5x5 in size, but not solid— they contain specific background holes in precise positions that must be preserved exactly in the output; any deviation (e.g., filling a hole or misplaced hole) makes the output incorrect.
 * Background color (bg) is always the most common or border color (e.g., 8 in train1, 4 in train2, 1 in train3, 3 in test); it surrounds all patterns and fills holes within them.
 * Patterns do not overlap and are separated by at least 1 bg cell; there may be multiple patterns per input, arranged either in a vertical column (stack output vertically with merged 1-bg separators) or horizontal row (place side-by-side with merged 1-bg separators on left/right).
 * Detection must identify the bounding 5x5 area for each pattern based on clusters of the same non-bg color, ignoring isolated small blobs; subtle connectivity: holes are bg, so the color cells may form connected components with "arms" or branches, but the overall shape fits exactly 5x5.
 * Output dimensions: For vertical stacking (e.g., 3 patterns), total height is 7*num_patterns - (num_patterns-1)*1 = 6 + 7*(num-1); width is 7. For horizontal (e.g., train2 with 3), height 7, width 7*3 - 2*1 = 19. Always pad each 5x5 with 1 bg row/column around.
 * Easy to miss: Patterns may have asymmetric holes (e.g., in train1's 6-shape, row 2 has holes at specific spots like positions 3 and 5); connected components of color must respect 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right), but since holes are bg, components are the color "skeleton." No diagonals for connectivity.
 * Across attempts (this is the only provided attempt, but it builds on a flawed assumption): Do not assume patterns start as solid 5x5 blocks—inputs already have holes, so searching for solid blocks misses everything. Components found outside a "large" area may actually be parts of the same object if connected around edges. Centering small components to "punch" holes assumes a reconstruction approach, but the correct method is direct extraction of the existing pattern. Handle multiple patterns of different colors (e.g., 1,6,4 in train1; 1,2,3 in train2; 8,4,3,9 in train3). Bg in output must match input bg. No scaling or rotation—exact preservation.
 * Other considerations: Inputs may have empty space or uneven spacing between patterns; output should crop tightly to the padded patterns without extra empty rows/columns. Colors are integers 1-9, bg often 1,3,4,8. Test input has bg=3, patterns in colors 4,8,2,1,6,9 arranged vertically like train1/3.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has some useful building blocks for bg detection and grid creation, but most are flawed or unhelpful (detailed below). No custom types are used, but a simple struct for patterns could help.

```python
def find_background_color(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Helpful: Correctly identifies bg as the color at [0][0], assuming uniform bg borders. Works in all examples.
    return grid[0][0] if grid else 0
```

```python
def create_empty_grid(h: int, w: int, bg: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Helpful: Creates a bg-filled grid of given size. Essential for padding output.
    return [[bg] * w for _ in range(h)]
```

```python
# Potential helpful function (not in code, but inferred as needed): Directly extract 5x5 patterns by finding bounding boxes of same-color connected components.
def find_patterns(grid: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (top-left row, top-left col, color)
    # Scan for 5x5 areas where >50% cells are same non-bg color, or use flood-fill to find connected components fitting 5x5 bounds.
    # Returns list of (r, c, color) for top-left of each pattern.
    patterns = []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    directions = [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                # Flood-fill to find component bounds
                component = []
                stack = [(i,j)]
                color = grid[i][j]
                min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = i, i, j, j
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    if visited[x][y] or grid[x][y] != color:
                        continue
                    visited[x][y] = True
                    component.append((x,y))
                    min_r = min(min_r, x)
                    max_r = max(max_r, x)
                    min_c = min(min_c, y)
                    max_c = max(max_c, y)
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                h = max_r - min_r + 1
                w = max_c - min_c + 1
                if h == 5 and w == 5 and len(component) > 10:  # Ensure it's a valid 5x5 pattern (not too sparse)
                    patterns.append((min_r, min_c, color))
    return patterns
```

The rest of the provided functions are mostly unhelpful or broken (see below).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt, but it demonstrates a core misunderstanding: Assumes input patterns are built from a solid 5x5 "core" plus separate small components to "punch" holes, but inputs already have pre-existing hole patterns that must be extracted directly without reconstruction—leading to all training examples failing.
 * find_large_shapes is broken and unhelpful: Searches for solid (uniform color) 5x5 blocks, but input patterns have bg holes, so it likely fails to detect any "larges" in real inputs; yet outputs were generated, suggesting it falsely triggered on partial solids or misdetected, producing approximate but incorrect patterns (don't use in future).
 * get_min_rc and compute_output_dimensions are partially helpful for layout (find min positions and pad to 7x7 per pattern, arrange vertically/horizontally), but only work if larges are correctly found; they ignore horizontal vs. vertical arrangement detection, hardcoding vertical stacking—causes issues if input is horizontal like train2.
 * find_small_components is broken and not relevant: Uses DFS to find connected components of color excluding a 5x5 "large" area, but since there's no solid large, it may find irrelevant or entire-object components; the exclusion logic (is_excluded checking a 5x5 box) assumes a solid core exists, which it doesn't—leads to wrong "small" shapes (e.g., over-connected holes). The 4-connectivity is correct, but applying it to "protrusions" misses that holes are bg, not color components. Don't use this approach; replace with direct pattern extraction.
 * modify_large_5x5 is broken and unhelpful: Starts with a solid 5x5 of color, then centers and "punches" bg into positions based on small components— this reconstructs a pattern but fails to match exact hole positions (e.g., connects adjacent color cells into solid runs where holes should be). Centering logic ((5 - h_s)//2) assumes symmetric placement, but patterns are asymmetric; it overwrites solid with bg for component shapes, but components are color, so it's punching color-shaped holes incorrectly. Results in filled-in holes (e.g., train1 6-shape row2: generated solid 6,6,6 at cols 3-5 instead of expected 6,8,6). Don't use; extract existing subgrid directly.
 * program overall: Detects bg correctly and creates padded output layout somewhat (e.g., correct 7x7 per pattern, vertical stacking for train1), but pattern contents are wrong due to reconstruction flaws—some simple patterns match by coincidence (e.g., train1 1-shape and 4-shape exact match, as their "punched" components happened to align), but complex ones don't (e.g., train1 6-shape mismatches in row2: generated [6,8,6,6,6] inner vs. expected [6,8,6,8,6]; row4 matches by luck).
 * Train1: 1-shape and 4-shape patterns match expected exactly (what worked: simple hole alignment via centering); 6-shape mismatches in row2 (generated connects cols3-5 as color, expected has hole at col5; unknown why—perhaps component found a 3-wide blob instead of separated parts).
 * Train2: Horizontal layout detected implicitly but patterns wrong; 1-shape matches top/bottom rows but mismatches inners (e.g., row3 for 2-shape: generated [2,4,4,2,2] inner vs. expected [2,4,4,2,2] wait, actually row2/4 for 2's: generated [2,4,2,2,2] vs. expected [2,4,2,4,2]—connects col4-6 instead of alternating holes). 3-shape similar connection errors.
 * Train3: Multiple mismatches; 8-shape row4 solid color vs. expected [8,8,8,1,8] (fills hole at col4); 4-shape row4 [4,4,1,4,4]? generated [4,4,4,1,4,4,1] wait, print shows differences like row5 for 4's solid vs. expected solid, but row4 expected [4,4,1,4,4] inner? Actually, 4-shape in generated row4: [4,4,4,1,4,4,1] vs. expected [4,4,1,4,4,1]—extra color at col3. 3-shape and 9-shape have filled holes (e.g., 9 row2: generated solid-ish vs. expected [9,1,9,9,9]).
 * extract_objects not present, but implied need: Direct flood-fill or bounding box to pull 5x5 subgrids is essential for exact preservation; the code's component funcs are insufficient.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flaws as training examples— it isolates patterns into padded sections (vertically stacked like train1/3, with bg=3, correct dimensions ~21x13?), but the internal patterns have incorrect hole positions (filled or misconnected colors) due to the reconstruction approach.
 * For the top 4-shape (rows 2-6): Row4 has [4,4,3,3,4] inner vs. likely expected more holes (based on train patterns, probably [4,4,3,4,4] or similar, but generated fills row4 col3-4 as color? Wait, print shows row4: [4,4,3,3,4] no— [3,4,4,3,3,4,3] inner [4,4,3,3,4], which connects oddly; row3 [4,4,3,4,4] seems partial fill). Bottom 6-shape rows 14-18: Mostly solid rows (e.g., row15/16/17/18 all [6,6,6,6,6] inner), but expected likely has holes like train1's 6 (alternating or branched holes)—appears over-punched or no punch, making it too solid.
 * Middle 8-shape (rows8-12): Row10 [8,3,3,3,8] inner has triple hole vs. likely expected single/paired holes; 2-shape (rows 8? wait overlapping print) row9 [2,3,3,2,2] connects col4-5. 1-shape and 9-shape similar: 9-shape row15 solid vs. expected patterned (e.g., train3 9 has holes in row2/3). Overall, patterns are approximate but fail exactness—missing asymmetric holes, over-connecting color runs (e.g., 3-wide solids where 1-wide with holes expected). This doesn't make sense as correct output; it would only pass if inputs had separate small blobs, but based on training failures, it's wrong—need direct extraction to handle test's complex vertical arrangement with 6 patterns (4,8 / 2,1 / 6,9?).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 12:19:18] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are present in **every** example. These are limited to obvious, consistent effects between elements (e.g., same-color components affecting each other via pixel reduction and hole addition). Only elements with direct, repeatable impacts on outputs are included; irrelevant elements (e.g., small shapes of colors without a matching large shape, which disappear without effect) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact hole count determination or output positioning) are noted as such.

1. **Large 25-pixel shape of color C interacts with small shapes (total pixels S=4-7) of the same color C**:
   - Effect: The total pixels S from all small C shapes are subtracted from the large C shape's 25 pixels, resulting in an output shape of color C with pixels = 25 - S (range 18-21).
   - Additional effect: The large C shape gains holes (1-3) in the output; exact number is unknown (varies inconsistently with S or position).
   - Properties involved: Color (must match), pixels (subtraction), holes (added to large C).
   - Bounding box consistency: Input large C has bbox span of 4 units in x and y (e.g., [1,1,5,5]); output transformed C retains bbox span of 4 units in x and y.
   - The small C shapes disappear from the output (no independent presence).
   - Applies only to non-background colors C; occurs for every such large C in every train example.

2. **Input background color B affects output small shapes and background**:
   - Effect: Multiple small shapes (1-7 pixels each, total ~15-25 pixels across 4-6 shapes) of color B appear in the output; these are new or transformed (exact source unknown, but always B).
   - Additional effect: The input background (color B, high pixels ~247-293, many holes 11-17) transforms to an output background of same color B (pixels ~58-69, few holes 3-4, smaller bbox).
   - Properties involved: Color (persists as B), holes (reduced), pixels (reduced), bbox (shrunk, often to strip or partial grid).
   - Small input shapes of B (if present, pixels 1-7) may contribute but do not fully explain the output small B shapes (transformation unknown).
   - Occurs in every train example; no other colors produce output small shapes or modified backgrounds.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., position-to-color, cross-color effects, or hole-to-color) are observable across all examples. Output positioning of transformed shapes (e.g., grid-like stacking) varies and cannot be tied to input properties consistently.

[2025-10-03 12:21:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are present in **every** example. These are limited to obvious, consistent effects between elements (e.g., same-color components affecting each other via pixel reduction and hole addition). Only elements with direct, repeatable impacts on outputs are included; irrelevant elements (e.g., small shapes of colors without a matching large shape, which disappear without effect) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact hole count determination or output positioning) are noted as such.

1. **Large 25-pixel shape of color C interacts with small shapes (total pixels S=4-7) of the same color C**:
   - Effect: The total pixels S from all small C shapes are subtracted from the large C shape's 25 pixels, resulting in an output shape of color C with pixels = 25 - S (range 18-21).
   - Additional effect: The large C shape gains holes (1-3) in the output; exact number is unknown (varies inconsistently with S or position).
   - Properties involved: Color (must match), pixels (subtraction), holes (added to large C).
   - Bounding box consistency: Input large C has bbox span of 4 units in x and y (e.g., [1,1,5,5]); output transformed C retains bbox span of 4 units in x and y.
   - The small C shapes disappear from the output (no independent presence).
   - Applies only to non-background colors C; occurs for every such large C in every train example.

2. **Input background color B affects output small shapes and background**:
   - Effect: Multiple small shapes (1-7 pixels each, total ~15-25 pixels across 4-6 shapes) of color B appear in the output; these are new or transformed (exact source unknown, but always B).
   - Additional effect: The input background (color B, high pixels ~247-293, many holes 11-17) transforms to an output background of same color B (pixels ~58-69, few holes 3-4, smaller bbox).
   - Properties involved: Color (persists as B), holes (reduced), pixels (reduced), bbox (shrunk, often to strip or partial grid).
   - Small input shapes of B (if present, pixels 1-7) may contribute but do not fully explain the output small B shapes (transformation unknown).
   - Occurs in every train example; no other colors produce output small shapes or modified backgrounds.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., position-to-color, cross-color effects, or hole-to-color) are observable across all examples. Output positioning of transformed shapes (e.g., grid-like stacking) varies and cannot be tied to input properties consistently.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 12:44:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid contains background (border color) and multiple 5x5 "large" colored blocks (possibly with internal background holes), along with scattered small cells of the same colors that encode 3x3 binary patterns indicating hole positions. The goal is to detect these large blocks, group them by starting row/column positions into a meta-grid layout, and generate a new larger output grid arranging the blocks with 1-cell separators, where each block has a solid color border and an inner 3x3 area with holes (background) placed according to the pattern derived from the small cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Large blocks are 5x5 regions dominated by one non-background color, but may contain internal background "holes" (e.g., in the test input, the 4-block at approx. rows 1-5, cols 1-5 has several 3's inside like at (2,2), (2,3), (3,3)); detection must tolerate some holes rather than requiring fully solid color.
 * Small cells of a color (outside its large block) encode the hole pattern: collect their row starts (up to 3 unique rows), column span (assumed 3 consecutive cols from min col), and set 1 where a small cell exists in the 3x3 subgrid defined by those rows/cols (0 otherwise); if fewer than 3 rows, duplicate the pattern vertically to fill 3x3.
 * Group large blocks by unique starting rows (r_groups) and columns (c_groups) to form a rectangular meta-layout; output grid size is (5 * num_r + num_r + 1) rows by (5 * num_c + num_c + 1) cols, with full horizontal/vertical separator lines of background, and blocks placed at offsets 1 + k*6, 1 + m*6.
 * In output blocks, always draw a solid color border on the outer 5x5 (top/bottom rows and left/right cols full color, ignoring any input holes); apply the 3x3 hole pattern only to the strict inner 3x3, setting to background where pattern=1 (hole) and color where 0 (keep).
 * Background is always the border color (top-left cell); no large blocks means fallback to all-background grid (but this is unhelpful and likely wrong if blocks exist but aren't detected).
 * Subtle: Small cell columns for pattern are assumed to span exactly 2 units (min to max=2), taking 3 cols; if not, the code clips/truncates, which may break if smalls are more spread out.
 * Subtle: Only one large block per color assumed (code stores color_to_pos as last seen); multiple larges per color would overwrite.
 * Subtle: Pattern derivation uses exact positions of small C's, but only checks presence in the computed 3x3 cols per selected row; ignores smalls outside those cols or extra rows.
 * All non-block/large areas in input are background; no other elements like lines or varying sizes.
 * Output must preserve color identities and positions for grouping; no rotation or other transforms.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def get_background_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Identify the background color as the border color."""
    return g[0][0]
```
(This is solid and used correctly for B.)

```python
def find_large_blocks(g: List[List[int]], B: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    """Find all 5x5 solid non-background blocks: (color, start_row_0idx, start_col_0idx)."""
    # Note: Current version requires fully solid 5x5 (all cells == color); needs update to handle holes,
    # e.g., by checking if >=20/25 cells == color, or using connected component size/dominance.
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    large_blocks = []
    for i in range(n - 4):
        for j in range(m - 4):
            color = g[i][j]
            if color == B:
                continue
            is_large = all(g[i + di][j + dj] == color for di in range(5) for dj in range(5))
            if is_large:
                large_blocks.append((color, i, j))
    return large_blocks
```
(This is mostly helpful for solid cases but broken for holed larges in test; essential for extraction but must be fixed, e.g., change to count matching cells > threshold like 21, or find max-color region per 5x5 window.)

```python
def get_group_starts(large_blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Get sorted unique row starts and col starts from large blocks."""
    r_set = set(rs for _, rs, _ in large_blocks)
    c_set = set(cs for _, _, cs in large_blocks)
    return sorted(list(r_set)), sorted(list(c_set))

def build_block_map(large_blocks: List[Tuple[int, int, int]], r_groups: List[int], c_groups: List[int]) -> Dict[Tuple[int, int], int]:
    """Map (row_group_idx, col_group_idx) to color."""
    # Helpful for meta-grid layout; assumes unique per (row_group, col_group).
    block_map: Dict[Tuple[int, int], int] = {}
    for color, rs, cs in large_blocks:
        k = r_groups.index(rs)
        mm = c_groups.index(cs)
        block_map[(k, mm)] = color
    return block_map
```
(These are helpful and correct for grouping/placement once blocks are detected.)

```python
def get_hole_pattern(g: List[List[int]], C: int, rs: int, cs: int, n: int, m: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Compute the 3x3 hole pattern (1=hole, 0=keep C) for color C's large at (rs, cs)."""
    # Helpful but subtle bugs: assumes small cols span exactly 2 (uses minc to minc+2); clips to first 3 rows if more; duplicates if <3 rows (may not match puzzle if unduplicated).
    # For test, would work if large detected, as smalls seem to form patterns like for 4: smalls in row2 cols3-4? Wait, need to verify.
    small_pos = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m)
                 if g[i][j] == C and not (rs <= i < rs + 5 and cs <= j < cs + 5)]
    if not small_pos:
        return [[0, 0, 0] for _ in range(3)]
    small_row_set = set(i for i, _ in small_pos)
    small_rows = sorted(small_row_set)
    h = len(small_rows)
    if h > 3:
        small_rows = small_rows[:3]
        h = 3
    small_col_set = set(j for _, j in small_pos)
    minc = min(small_col_set)
    maxc = max(small_col_set)
    # Assume maxc - minc == 2
    code_cols = list(range(minc, minc + 3))
    code_pattern = []
    for rr in range(h):
        ri = small_rows[rr]
        pat = [1 if g[ri][code_cols[cc]] == C else 0 for cc in range(3)]
        code_pattern.append(pat)
    if h == 3:
        full = code_pattern
    elif h == 2:
        full = [code_pattern[0], code_pattern[0], code_pattern[1]]
    elif h == 1:
        full = [code_pattern[0]] * 3
    else:
        full = [[0, 0, 0]] * 3
    return full
```
(This captures the pattern logic well but may need adjustment for col span !=2 or no duplication.)

(The main program function is helpful overall for assembly but relies on fixed detection; fallback to all-B is unhelpful and triggers wrongly.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Worked perfectly for training examples 1-3, correctly detecting solid 5x5 blocks, extracting small-cell patterns, grouping by starts, and building the separated meta-grid with bordered blocks and inner holes applied.
 * Failed for test input: large blocks (e.g., 4's at ~row1 col1, 8's at ~row1 col7, etc.) have internal background holes (e.g., 3's scattered inside each 5x5), so find_large_blocks detects zero blocks (requires 100% solid color), triggering fallback to all-background grid instead of processing.
 * Assumed fully solid large blocks without holes, missing the subtlety that larges can have internal backgrounds (easy to miss if trainings were solid-only).
 * Hole pattern extraction is mostly correct but untested in this attempt due to no detection; duplication for <3 rows may be wrong (unknown if puzzle duplicates or pads differently).
 * Grouping and output assembly (separators, border fill, inner pattern apply) demonstrate core layout rules correctly.
 * No handling for multiple larges per color or non-3-col small spans; get_hole_pattern clips extra rows/cols, which could break if smalls are irregular.
 * Fallback all-B grid is unhelpful and not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it; better to error or assume blocks exist).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is not shown explicitly, but based on code execution, it would be a full grid of background 3's (same size as input, 18x13 all 3's) due to zero large blocks detected— this does not look correct, as the input has clear 5x5 colored regions (e.g., mostly-4's block rows 1-5 cols 1-5 with ~4 internal 3's, similar for 8's, then lower bands for 2/1 and 6/9), which should be detected, patterned from smalls (e.g., for 4, smalls like in row 2 cols 4-5? but actually inspecting shows the "holes" are the smalls? Wait, no—the internal 3's are holes in large, smalls are the extras outside but in test they seem integrated), and rearranged into a ~19x13 meta-grid with separators and applied inner holes.
 * Expected output should be a larger grid (e.g., 19 rows for 3 row-groups at starts ~1,8,14; 13 cols for 2 col-groups at ~1,7) with horizontal separator rows of 3's (at rows 0,7,13,19?), vertical separators at cols 0,6,12?, solid-color borders on each 5x5 block position, and inner 3x3 with holes based on small-cell-derived patterns (e.g., for color 4, pattern might be something like [[0,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,0]] from scattered 4's, but unknown without running; the all-3's ignores all this).
 * The test input itself (shown grid) makes sense as input: background 3 borders full grid and separates blocks vertically/horizontally; three horizontal bands of two 5x5-ish blocks each (colors 4/8 top, 2/1 middle, 6/9 bottom), with each block having ~3-5 internal 3-holes forming no clear pattern but tolerated for detection; small cells of each color are minimal or absent outside larges (e.g., for 4, all 4's seem contained in its block, so pattern all-0s? but code would need to detect large first).
 * Difference from expected: Generated all-3's erases all colors/structures, while expected preserves/rearranges blocks with fixed borders and new inner holes (not the input's existing holes); this is different because detection failed—likely the core issue is strict solidity check (observed effect: misses holed larges, outputs blank vs. structured meta-grid).
