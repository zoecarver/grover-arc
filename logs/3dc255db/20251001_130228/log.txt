=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 13:02:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 13:17:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import math

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the train input/output pairs, below is a list of observed interactions, connections, or effects between elements (e.g., shapes, colors, positions, pixel counts). Only those that are **obvious and consistent across ALL three train examples** are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., unchanged large shapes that show no interaction in any example, like the Yellow p=9 in train 1 or Green p=3 in train 2) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear patterns (e.g., exact movement direction, which varies—top in trains 2/3, bottom/mid in train 1) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing a connection. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is provided.

1. **Same-color single-pixel components → merging into multi-pixel shapes of the same color**:
   - Single-pixel (pixels=1) components of the same color consistently interact by merging their pixels into one or more multi-pixel shapes (pixels>1) of the same color in the output.
   - Examples: Pink singles (3 total pixels) merge into a double (pixels=2) in train 1; Light Blue singles (4 total pixels) merge into a triple (pixels=3) + single in train 2; Dark Red singles (2 total pixels) contribute to a triple (pixels=3) in train 3.
   - Effect: Pixel count from merged components is rearranged into new bounding boxes (bbox), often forming bars or lines (e.g., vertical in trains 2/3). This interaction does not occur for all colors (e.g., single-pixel Greens do not merge in train 2).
   - Consistency: Observed in every train, but only for specific colors (Pink, Dark Red, Light Blue); no cross-color merging.

2. **Position proximity of same-color components → triggers merging or transformation**:
   - Components of the same color that are positionally close (e.g., adjacent or nearby bounding boxes, within ~1-2 units in x/y) consistently interact, leading to merging or repositioning as a group.
   - Examples: Dark Red single at [6,8] near [7,9] (Δx=1, Δy=1) merges/repositions in train 1; Light Blue singles clustered around x=1-2/y=5-7 and x=7/y=5 merge/reposition in train 2; Dark Red [3,7-6,8] p=5 near singles at [3,9]/[5,9] (same x-range, Δy=1) leads to transformation in train 3.
   - Effect: Original positions influence the new bbox (e.g., average/median x preserved roughly: x~2 group to x=2 in train 2; x=3/5 to x=5 in train 3). Unrelated distant components do not interact.
   - Consistency: Seen in every train for the affected colors; isolated singles (e.g., Pink [0,2] far from others) do not interact and remain unchanged.

3. **Pixel count of interacting same-color components → conserved or reduced in new shape**:
   - When same-color components merge due to proximity, their total pixel count is conserved in the new shape(s) in trains 1 and 2, but reduced in train 3 (indicating an inconsistent effect).
   - Examples: Pink (3→3 total), Dark Red (2→2 total) in train 1; Light Blue (4→4 total) in train 2; Dark Red (7→3 total, loss of 4 pixels) in train 3.
   - Effect: Contributes to new bbox size (e.g., pixels=3 forms [5,0,5,2] vertical span Δy=2 in train 3). No pixel addition observed.
   - Consistency: Partial—conservation holds in trains 1/2 but not 3; unknown why reduction occurs in train 3 (possibly due to interaction with a large component, but not explainable consistently).

4. **Color preservation in all interactions**:
   - No interactions change the color of any component; all effects (merging, repositioning) stay within the original color.
   - Examples: Merged Pinks remain Pink (train 1); Light Blues remain Light Blue (train 2); Dark Reds remain Dark Red (trains 1/3).
   - Effect: Isolates interactions to intra-color effects; no observed color-to-color influence (e.g., no Green affecting Light Blue in train 2).
   - Consistency: Absolute—holds in every train for all components.

5. **Bounding box (bbox) properties → define interaction scope and outcome shape**:
   - The bbox of nearby same-color components consistently determines the scope of interaction (e.g., overlapping or adjacent x/y ranges trigger merging), and the output bbox reflects a transformed arrangement (e.g., from scattered to compact).
   - Examples: Scattered single bboxes [6,8]/[7,9] → compact [1,10,2,10] (Δx=1) in train 1; clustered [2,5]/[1,6]/[2,7] bboxes → elongated [2,0,2,2] (Δy=2) in train 2; adjacent [3,7,6,8] + [3,9]/[5,9] → narrow [5,0,5,2] (Δx=0) in train 3.
   - Effect: Bbox edges influence new shape properties (e.g., horizontal to vertical transformation in some cases); no holes created (all output holes=0).
   - Consistency: Seen in every train; bbox is the primary spatial property enabling position-based interactions.

### Unknowns (Cannot Explain Without Forcing Connections)
- Exact trigger for which colors interact (e.g., why Dark Red/Light Blue/Pink in some trains but not Green singles in train 2, despite similar single-pixel/proximity properties).
- Precise new position rule (e.g., why top in trains 2/3 but bottom/mid in train 1; possibly grid-edge attraction, but inconsistent).
- Role of large (pixels>1) components in interactions (e.g., unchanged in trains 1/2, but the Dark Red p=5 is removed in train 3 after proximity interaction—unknown effect).
- Why pixel reduction occurs in train 3 (no parallel in other trains; possibly "absorption" by nearby colors like Pink, but no evidence of color interaction).
- No consistent cross-color effects (e.g., enclosure by one color affecting another, as hinted in the puzzle description, but not observable in data across all trains).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 13:37:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the train input/output pairs, below is a list of observed interactions, connections, or effects between elements (e.g., shapes, colors, positions, pixel counts). Only those that are **obvious and consistent across ALL three train examples** are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., unchanged large shapes that show no interaction in any example, like the Yellow p=9 in train 1 or Green p=3 in train 2) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear patterns (e.g., exact movement direction, which varies—top in trains 2/3, bottom/mid in train 1) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing a connection. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is provided.

1. **Same-color single-pixel components → merging into multi-pixel shapes of the same color**:
   - Single-pixel (pixels=1) components of the same color consistently interact by merging their pixels into one or more multi-pixel shapes (pixels>1) of the same color in the output.
   - Examples: Pink singles (3 total pixels) merge into a double (pixels=2) in train 1; Light Blue singles (4 total pixels) merge into a triple (pixels=3) + single in train 2; Dark Red singles (2 total pixels) contribute to a triple (pixels=3) in train 3.
   - Effect: Pixel count from merged components is rearranged into new bounding boxes (bbox), often forming bars or lines (e.g., vertical in trains 2/3). This interaction does not occur for all colors (e.g., single-pixel Greens do not merge in train 2).
   - Consistency: Observed in every train, but only for specific colors (Pink, Dark Red, Light Blue); no cross-color merging.

2. **Position proximity of same-color components → triggers merging or transformation**:
   - Components of the same color that are positionally close (e.g., adjacent or nearby bounding boxes, within ~1-2 units in x/y) consistently interact, leading to merging or repositioning as a group.
   - Examples: Dark Red single at [6,8] near [7,9] (Δx=1, Δy=1) merges/repositions in train 1; Light Blue singles clustered around x=1-2/y=5-7 and x=7/y=5 merge/reposition in train 2; Dark Red [3,7-6,8] p=5 near singles at [3,9]/[5,9] (same x-range, Δy=1) leads to transformation in train 3.
   - Effect: Original positions influence the new bbox (e.g., average/median x preserved roughly: x~2 group to x=2 in train 2; x=3/5 to x=5 in train 3). Unrelated distant components do not interact.
   - Consistency: Seen in every train for the affected colors; isolated singles (e.g., Pink [0,2] far from others) do not interact and remain unchanged.

3. **Pixel count of interacting same-color components → conserved or reduced in new shape**:
   - When same-color components merge due to proximity, their total pixel count is conserved in the new shape(s) in trains 1 and 2, but reduced in train 3 (indicating an inconsistent effect).
   - Examples: Pink (3→3 total), Dark Red (2→2 total) in train 1; Light Blue (4→4 total) in train 2; Dark Red (7→3 total, loss of 4 pixels) in train 3.
   - Effect: Contributes to new bbox size (e.g., pixels=3 forms [5,0,5,2] vertical span Δy=2 in train 3). No pixel addition observed.
   - Consistency: Partial—conservation holds in trains 1/2 but not 3; unknown why reduction occurs in train 3 (possibly due to interaction with a large component, but not explainable consistently).

4. **Color preservation in all interactions**:
   - No interactions change the color of any component; all effects (merging, repositioning) stay within the original color.
   - Examples: Merged Pinks remain Pink (train 1); Light Blues remain Light Blue (train 2); Dark Reds remain Dark Red (trains 1/3).
   - Effect: Isolates interactions to intra-color effects; no observed color-to-color influence (e.g., no Green affecting Light Blue in train 2).
   - Consistency: Absolute—holds in every train for all components.

5. **Bounding box (bbox) properties → define interaction scope and outcome shape**:
   - The bbox of nearby same-color components consistently determines the scope of interaction (e.g., overlapping or adjacent x/y ranges trigger merging), and the output bbox reflects a transformed arrangement (e.g., from scattered to compact).
   - Examples: Scattered single bboxes [6,8]/[7,9] → compact [1,10,2,10] (Δx=1) in train 1; clustered [2,5]/[1,6]/[2,7] bboxes → elongated [2,0,2,2] (Δy=2) in train 2; adjacent [3,7,6,8] + [3,9]/[5,9] → narrow [5,0,5,2] (Δx=0) in train 3.
   - Effect: Bbox edges influence new shape properties (e.g., horizontal to vertical transformation in some cases); no holes created (all output holes=0).
   - Consistency: Seen in every train; bbox is the primary spatial property enabling position-based interactions.

### Unknowns (Cannot Explain Without Forcing Connections)
- Exact trigger for which colors interact (e.g., why Dark Red/Light Blue/Pink in some trains but not Green singles in train 2, despite similar single-pixel/proximity properties).
- Precise new position rule (e.g., why top in trains 2/3 but bottom/mid in train 1; possibly grid-edge attraction, but inconsistent).
- Role of large (pixels>1) components in interactions (e.g., unchanged in trains 1/2, but the Dark Red p=5 is removed in train 3 after proximity interaction—unknown effect).
- Why pixel reduction occurs in train 3 (no parallel in other trains; possibly "absorption" by nearby colors like Pink, but no evidence of color interaction).
- No consistent cross-color effects (e.g., enclosure by one color affecting another, as hinted in the puzzle description, but not observable in data across all trains).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 13:48:33] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

[2025-10-01 13:48:38] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed **in every puzzle** (i.e., present across all three train examples). I focused solely on properties (e.g., color, position, size via pixels/bbox, merging) that show clear cause-effect relationships or interactions between elements, such as one component influencing the position or form of another. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., black background, unchanged large blocks with no observed effect on others) are excluded. Inconsistent or sporadic behaviors (e.g., pixel count not always conserved; Pink sometimes dynamic but not always) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing. No high-level puzzle solution or total transformation rules are inferred or provided—only direct, repeatable connections.

#### 1. **Color -> Static Behavior (No Transformation)**
   - **Green color -> static position and properties**: In every example, all Green components (regardless of size, e.g., 1-7 pixels) remain unchanged in bbox, pixels, and position. They act as "anchors" that do not move but influence nearby dynamic components (see below). No exceptions observed.
   - **Yellow color -> static position and properties** (observed in train 1, but consistent where present): The Yellow component (9 pixels) remains unchanged. It serves as an anchor similar to Green, influencing adjacent dynamic components. (Note: Only one example, but no counterexamples.)

#### 2. **Color -> Dynamic Behavior (Transformation via Movement/Merging)**
   - **Dark Red color -> position change and merging with other Dark Red**: In every example where present (trains 1 and 3), all Dark Red components (small or medium, 1-5 pixels) disappear from original positions and reappear as merged form(s) in new position(s). Merging reduces the number of separate components (e.g., 2→1 in train 1; 3→1 in train 3). Total pixels sometimes conserved (train 1), but not always (train 3, unknown reason for loss).
   - **Light Blue color -> position change and merging with other Light Blue**: In the example where present (train 2), all Light Blue components (1 pixel each) disappear and reappear as merged form(s) in new position(s). Merging reduces components (4→2) and conserves total pixels. (Note: Only one example, but fits dynamic pattern without contradiction.)

#### 3. **Dynamic Color + Static Color -> Position Attachment (Boundary Influence)**
   - **Dynamic component position -> attachment to adjacent static anchor (Green or Yellow or large Pink)**: In every example, transformed dynamic components (Dark Red or Light Blue) relocate to positions directly adjacent (sharing edge via bbox overlap or touching coordinates) to a static anchor component. Anchors are Green (all examples), Yellow (train 1), or large Pink (>5 pixels, trains 2-3). Examples:
     - Train 1: Merged Dark Red attaches left/bottom to Green bbox [3,8,5,10] (new bbox [1,10,2,10] touches x=3 at y=10).
     - Train 1: Merged Pink (dynamic here) attaches right to Yellow bbox [2,2,6,4] (new bbox [7,3,8,3] touches x=6 at y=3).
     - Train 2: Merged Light Blue attaches top to Green/Pink bboxes (e.g., [2,0,2,2] above [2,3,2,4]; [7,2,7,2] above [7,3,7,3]).
     - Train 3: Merged Dark Red attaches top to large Pink bbox [3,3,6,5] (new bbox [5,0,5,2] touches x=5 at y=3, vertically aligned).
   - This is the most consistent interaction: Dynamic shapes do not relocate in isolation; their new bbox is always constrained to touch a static anchor's bbox edge. No dynamic relocations occur without an adjacent static component.

#### 4. **Same Color (Dynamic) + Multiplicity -> Merging (Shape Property Change)**
   - **Multiple components of same dynamic color -> reduced count via merging**: In every example with multiple dynamic components of the same color (Dark Red in 1 and 3; Light Blue in 2; Pink in 1), they merge into fewer components (always 2+ → 1-2). Merged forms often become linear (horizontal bar in train 1 Pink/Dark Red; vertical in train 2 Light Blue and train 3 Dark Red). Bbox changes to reflect compact alignment (e.g., from scattered 1-pixel to 2-3 pixel line). This interacts with position attachment (above): Merging occurs before/ during relocation to anchor.
   - Pixels in merged form: Conserved in trains 1-2, but reduced in train 3 (unknown reason—possible interaction with anchor type or position not explainable from data).

#### 5. **Holes Property -> No Interaction/Change**
   - **Holes=0 -> preserved across all components**: Every component in inputs and outputs has holes=0, with no observed effect on movement, merging, or color. No connections to other properties (e.g., no hole-induced transformations).

#### Unknowns (Cannot Explain Without Forcing)
- **Direction of attachment (e.g., top vs. side vs. bottom)**: Always adjacent to static anchor (consistent), but specific direction varies (top in trains 2-3; side/bottom in train 1) and cannot be tied to a single consistent property (e.g., not always "top" or "gravity-based"; possibly color-pair specific like Light Blue always top, but insufficient examples for Dark Red).
- **When Pink is dynamic vs. static**: Small Pinks (<2 pixels) transform in train 1 but stay static in trains 2-3. No consistent trigger (e.g., not size, position, or adjacency alone).
- **Pixel loss in merging**: Occurs only in train 3 (Dark Red: 7→3 pixels); unknown cause, as it contradicts conservation in other examples. No clear link to bbox, holes, or anchors.
- **Role of isolated small statics (e.g., single-pixel Green or Pink)**: They remain unchanged but show no consistent effect on dynamics (e.g., no attachment observed to them in any example).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., color→color change, position→color shift, or hole-influenced movement) are observable across all examples. Scattered or irrelevant elements (e.g., non-interacting small isolated shapes without dynamics) were ignored.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

```
These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import math

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train input-output pairs, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed **in every puzzle** (i.e., present across all three train examples). I focused solely on properties (e.g., color, position, size via pixels/bbox, merging) that show clear cause-effect relationships or interactions between elements, such as one component influencing the position or form of another. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., black background, unchanged large blocks with no observed effect on others) are excluded. Inconsistent or sporadic behaviors (e.g., pixel count not always conserved; Pink sometimes dynamic but not always) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing. No high-level puzzle solution or total transformation rules are inferred or provided—only direct, repeatable connections.

#### 1. **Color -> Static Behavior (No Transformation)**
   - **Green color -> static position and properties**: In every example, all Green components (regardless of size, e.g., 1-7 pixels) remain unchanged in bbox, pixels, and position. They act as "anchors" that do not move but influence nearby dynamic components (see below). No exceptions observed.
   - **Yellow color -> static position and properties** (observed in train 1, but consistent where present): The Yellow component (9 pixels) remains unchanged. It serves as an anchor similar to Green, influencing adjacent dynamic components. (Note: Only one example, but no counterexamples.)

#### 2. **Color -> Dynamic Behavior (Transformation via Movement/Merging)**
   - **Dark Red color -> position change and merging with other Dark Red**: In every example where present (trains 1 and 3), all Dark Red components (small or medium, 1-5 pixels) disappear from original positions and reappear as merged form(s) in new position(s). Merging reduces the number of separate components (e.g., 2→1 in train 1; 3→1 in train 3). Total pixels sometimes conserved (train 1), but not always (train 3, unknown reason for loss).
   - **Light Blue color -> position change and merging with other Light Blue**: In the example where present (train 2), all Light Blue components (1 pixel each) disappear and reappear as merged form(s) in new position(s). Merging reduces components (4→2) and conserves total pixels. (Note: Only one example, but fits dynamic pattern without contradiction.)

#### 3. **Dynamic Color + Static Color -> Position Attachment (Boundary Influence)**
   - **Dynamic component position -> attachment to adjacent static anchor (Green or Yellow or large Pink)**: In every example, transformed dynamic components (Dark Red or Light Blue) relocate to positions directly adjacent (sharing edge via bbox overlap or touching coordinates) to a static anchor component. Anchors are Green (all examples), Yellow (train 1), or large Pink (>5 pixels, trains 2-3). Examples:
     - Train 1: Merged Dark Red attaches left/bottom to Green bbox [3,8,5,10] (new bbox [1,10,2,10] touches x=3 at y=10).
     - Train 1: Merged Pink (dynamic here) attaches right to Yellow bbox [2,2,6,4] (new bbox [7,3,8,3] touches x=6 at y=3).
     - Train 2: Merged Light Blue attaches top to Green/Pink bboxes (e.g., [2,0,2,2] above [2,3,2,4]; [7,2,7,2] above [7,3,7,3]).
     - Train 3: Merged Dark Red attaches top to large Pink bbox [3,3,6,5] (new bbox [5,0,5,2] touches x=5 at y=3, vertically aligned).
   - This is the most consistent interaction: Dynamic shapes do not relocate in isolation; their new bbox is always constrained to touch a static anchor's bbox edge. No dynamic relocations occur without an adjacent static component.

#### 4. **Same Color (Dynamic) + Multiplicity -> Merging (Shape Property Change)**
   - **Multiple components of same dynamic color -> reduced count via merging**: In every example with multiple dynamic components of the same color (Dark Red in 1 and 3; Light Blue in 2; Pink in 1), they merge into fewer components (always 2+ → 1-2). Merged forms often become linear (horizontal bar in train 1 Pink/Dark Red; vertical in train 2 Light Blue and train 3 Dark Red). Bbox changes to reflect compact alignment (e.g., from scattered 1-pixel to 2-3 pixel line). This interacts with position attachment (above): Merging occurs before/ during relocation to anchor.
   - Pixels in merged form: Conserved in trains 1-2, but reduced in train 3 (unknown reason—possible interaction with anchor type or position not explainable from data).

#### 5. **Holes Property -> No Interaction/Change**
   - **Holes=0 -> preserved across all components**: Every component in inputs and outputs has holes=0, with no observed effect on movement, merging, or color. No connections to other properties (e.g., no hole-induced transformations).

#### Unknowns (Cannot Explain Without Forcing)
- **Direction of attachment (e.g., top vs. side vs. bottom)**: Always adjacent to static anchor (consistent), but specific direction varies (top in trains 2-3; side/bottom in train 1) and cannot be tied to a single consistent property (e.g., not always "top" or "gravity-based"; possibly color-pair specific like Light Blue always top, but insufficient examples for Dark Red).
- **When Pink is dynamic vs. static**: Small Pinks (<2 pixels) transform in train 1 but stay static in trains 2-3. No consistent trigger (e.g., not size, position, or adjacency alone).
- **Pixel loss in merging**: Occurs only in train 3 (Dark Red: 7→3 pixels); unknown cause, as it contradicts conservation in other examples. No clear link to bbox, holes, or anchors.
- **Role of isolated small statics (e.g., single-pixel Green or Pink)**: They remain unchanged but show no consistent effect on dynamics (e.g., no attachment observed to them in any example).

No other consistent interactions (e.g., color→color change, position→color shift, or hole-influenced movement) are observable across all examples. Scattered or irrelevant elements (e.g., non-interacting small isolated shapes without dynamics) were ignored.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 13:58:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

def get_neighbors8(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component detection.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors8(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component finder is core and works well for extracting all blobs per color; uses stack for efficiency.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(Quick check for border-touching, key for identifying "large" anchors.)

```python
def get_small_comps(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int, color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    return [comp for comp in components.get(color, []) if len(comp) < 8 and not touches_border(comp, rows, cols)]
```
(Extracts removable small comps; threshold of 8 and no-border is puzzle-specific.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(Averages for positioning; helpful for deciding attachment side/row/col, but can be imprecise for non-central blobs.)

```python
def get_union_positions(pos_lists: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for pos_list in pos_lists:
        for p in pos_list:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(Unions multiple small comps into one set for group placement; dedups correctly.)

```python
def get_large_pos(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], color: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for comp in components.get(color, []):
        if len(comp) >= 8 or touches_border(comp, rows, cols):
            return comp
    return []
```
(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 13:59:02] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Rectangular blocks**: Solid, grid-aligned shapes in 1x1 to 3x3 sizes, forming L-shapes, frames, or standalone units.
- **Colors used**: Cyan (light blue), red, yellow, purple (magenta-violet), pink (light magenta), green; each block is uniformly colored without gradients.
- **Compositional elements**: Overlapping or adjacent blocks creating frames (e.g., outer red with inner yellow), L-shapes (e.g., cyan or green arms), and clustered groups (e.g., small squares in red/purple); positions vary between top-right clusters, bottom-left frames, and bottom-right stacks in input, shifting to top-left singles, horizontal extensions, and bottom L-shapes in output.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions or connections observed **in every train example** (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on elements with clear, repeatable links (e.g., how one property affects another or how components influence each other) that appear without exception. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the black background, which remains uniform and uninfluencing) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., pixel conservation, which holds in trains 1 and 2 but not 3) are noted but not treated as interactions. Transformations themselves are not explained or solved—where the "how" of an effect is unclear, it is called out as unknown. No high-level puzzle interpretation is included.

#### 1. **Same-Color Blocks as Interconnected Components (Color → Position/Shape Transformation)**
   - **Description**: Blocks sharing the same color form interconnected groups that affect each other's position and/or shape in the output. Specifically, if multiple blocks of one color are present in the input and that color undergoes changes, the input blocks of that color are removed, and new blocks of the **exact same color** appear in different positions/shapes. Other colors' blocks remain unaffected (static).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The presence of multiple same-color blocks triggers a collective reconfiguration (movement, merging into fewer blocks, or reshaping) for the entire group of that color. Isolated same-color blocks (e.g., a single unchanged block of that color) do not trigger this for themselves but may coexist with the changing group.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Pink group (multiple small blocks) reconfigures into new Pink block(s); Dark Red group (multiple small blocks) reconfigures into new Dark Red block(s); other colors (Yellow, Green) static.
     - Train 2: Light Blue group (multiple small blocks) reconfigures into new Light Blue block(s); other colors (Pink, Green) static.
     - Train 3: Dark Red group (multiple blocks, varying sizes) reconfigures into new Dark Red block(s); other color (Pink) static.
   - **Properties Involved**: Color (unchanging invariant that defines the group); position (input positions of group members affect output positions, but exact mapping unknown); shape/size (input small/simple shapes often lead to output compact shapes like bars, but details unknown).
   - **Unknowns**: The specific rule for how input positions or counts within the group determine the output position/shape is unknown and varies (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical bars, top vs. bottom placement).

#### 2. **Position → Static vs. Changing Behavior (No Interaction for Unchanged Blocks)**
   - **Description**: Certain blocks remain completely static (identical color, bbox, pixels in input and output), indicating their positions do not trigger or allow interaction with other elements. These are consistently "non-interacting" components relative to the puzzle changes.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Blocks in positions that do not align with changing groups (e.g., not part of a multi-block same-color cluster) have no effect on or from transformations. Changing blocks (those removed) must be in positions that connect them to their same-color group, enabling group-level movement/reshaping.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Multiple Yellow, Green, and one Pink blocks static; changing Pinks and Dark Reds in distinct positions (mid/top and bottom-right).
     - Train 2: All Pink and Green blocks static; changing Light Blues in mid/bottom positions.
     - Train 3: All Pink blocks static (various positions/sizes); changing Dark Reds in bottom positions.
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (bbox coordinates determine if a block is "static-isolated" or part of a changing group); color (static blocks are often the only ones or majority in their color group if no change occurs).
   - **Unknowns**: The exact positional criteria (e.g., threshold for "near" other same-color blocks, like adjacency or diagonal proximity) that distinguishes static from changing blocks is unknown, though small/separated blocks are more likely to change when grouped by color.

#### 3. **Shape Properties → No Effect on Transformations (Holes and Edges Invariant)**
   - **Description**: All blocks have 0 holes and sharp/blocky edges (pixelated style), with no variation or change in these properties.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Hole count (always 0) and edge style (uniformly sharp, no gradients/silhouettes affecting visibility) do not interact with or influence color, position, or other blocks—no block gains/loses holes, and edges do not cause splitting/merging beyond same-color group effects.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**: Universal (every block in every input/output has holes=0; no edge-based changes like smoothing or hole creation observed).
   - **Properties Involved**: Holes (fixed at 0, no effect on movement); edges/silhouettes (fixed pixelated style, no influence on how shapes combine or move).
   - **Unknowns**: None— this is a non-interaction that is fully consistent and obvious.

No other interactions (e.g., cross-color effects like one color influencing another's movement, or consistent pixel-based merging) are obvious and present in **every** train example. Elements like the uniform black background or overall composition (e.g., frames/L-shapes) do not show consistent effects across all cases, as they vary and do not reliably cause changes.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 14:00:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

```
These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import math

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only the obvious and consistent interactions or connections observed **in every train example** (1, 2, and 3). I focused solely on elements with clear, repeatable links (e.g., how one property affects another or how components influence each other) that appear without exception. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the black background, which remains uniform and uninfluencing) are excluded. Non-consistent patterns (e.g., pixel conservation, which holds in trains 1 and 2 but not 3) are noted but not treated as interactions. Transformations themselves are not explained or solved—where the "how" of an effect is unclear, it is called out as unknown. No high-level puzzle interpretation is included.

#### 1. **Same-Color Blocks as Interconnected Components (Color → Position/Shape Transformation)**
   - **Description**: Blocks sharing the same color form interconnected groups that affect each other's position and/or shape in the output. Specifically, if multiple blocks of one color are present in the input and that color undergoes changes, the input blocks of that color are removed, and new blocks of the **exact same color** appear in different positions/shapes. Other colors' blocks remain unaffected (static).
   - **Effect/Interaction**: The presence of multiple same-color blocks triggers a collective reconfiguration (movement, merging into fewer blocks, or reshaping) for the entire group of that color. Isolated same-color blocks (e.g., a single unchanged block of that color) do not trigger this for themselves but may coexist with the changing group.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Pink group (multiple small blocks) reconfigures into new Pink block(s); Dark Red group (multiple small blocks) reconfigures into new Dark Red block(s); other colors (Yellow, Green) static.
     - Train 2: Light Blue group (multiple small blocks) reconfigures into new Light Blue block(s); other colors (Pink, Green) static.
     - Train 3: Dark Red group (multiple blocks, varying sizes) reconfigures into new Dark Red block(s); other color (Pink) static.
   - **Properties Involved**: Color (unchanging invariant that defines the group); position (input positions of group members affect output positions, but exact mapping unknown); shape/size (input small/simple shapes often lead to output compact shapes like bars, but details unknown).
   - **Unknowns**: The specific rule for how input positions or counts within the group determine the output position/shape is unknown and varies (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical bars, top vs. bottom placement).

#### 2. **Position → Static vs. Changing Behavior (No Interaction for Unchanged Blocks)**
   - **Description**: Certain blocks remain completely static (identical color, bbox, pixels in input and output), indicating their positions do not trigger or allow interaction with other elements. These are consistently "non-interacting" components relative to the puzzle changes.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Blocks in positions that do not align with changing groups (e.g., not part of a multi-block same-color cluster) have no effect on or from transformations. Changing blocks (those removed) must be in positions that connect them to their same-color group, enabling group-level movement/reshaping.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Multiple Yellow, Green, and one Pink blocks static; changing Pinks and Dark Reds in distinct positions (mid/top and bottom-right).
     - Train 2: All Pink and Green blocks static; changing Light Blues in mid/bottom positions.
     - Train 3: All Pink blocks static (various positions/sizes); changing Dark Reds in bottom positions.
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (bbox coordinates determine if a block is "static-isolated" or part of a changing group); color (static blocks are often the only ones or majority in their color group if no change occurs).
   - **Unknowns**: The exact positional criteria (e.g., threshold for "near" other same-color blocks, like adjacency or diagonal proximity) that distinguishes static from changing blocks is unknown, though small/separated blocks are more likely to change when grouped by color.

#### 3. **Shape Properties → No Effect on Transformations (Holes and Edges Invariant)**
   - **Description**: All blocks have 0 holes and sharp/blocky edges (pixelated style), with no variation or change in these properties.
   - **Effect/Interaction**: Hole count (always 0) and edge style (uniformly sharp, no gradients/silhouettes affecting visibility) do not interact with or influence color, position, or other blocks—no block gains/loses holes, and edges do not cause splitting/merging beyond same-color group effects.
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**: Universal (every block in every input/output has holes=0; no edge-based changes like smoothing or hole creation observed).
   - **Properties Involved**: Holes (fixed at 0, no effect on movement); edges/silhouettes (fixed pixelated style, no influence on how shapes combine or move).
   - **Unknowns**: None— this is a non-interaction that is fully consistent and obvious.

No other interactions (e.g., cross-color effects like one color influencing another's movement, or consistent pixel-based merging) are obvious and present in **every** train example. Elements like the uniform black background or overall composition (e.g., frames/L-shapes) do not show consistent effects across all cases, as they vary and do not reliably cause changes.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 14:12:50] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set

def get_neighbors8(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This is helpful for accurate 8-connectivity adjacency checks during component finding and attachment adjacency counting.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(This correctly identifies fixed border-touching components; essential for distinguishing movable small blobs.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors8(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately extracts all components per color using DFS/stack, enabling separation of small vs. large; reuse in future attempts.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These are helpful for aligning attachments and banners by centroid position; averages guide "closest" edge placement.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

[2025-10-01 14:13:08] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties or elements that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case (e.g., via removal of some components and creation of new ones). Only consistent patterns are included; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., unchanged isolated 1-pixel blocks like the Pink at [0,2,0,2] in train 1 or Green at [1,5,1,5] in train 2) are excluded, as they show no interaction. Inconsistent or unexplainable aspects (e.g., exact relocation logic or pixel preservation) are noted as unknown. No high-level puzzle solution is attempted or implied.

- **Same-color components interact via merging/replacement**:
  - Multiple components (typically small/detached ones) of the **same color** are removed from their original positions.
  - A new component of the **same color** appears in the output, replacing the removed ones.
  - This reduces the total number of components for that color (e.g., 3 Pinks → 2 in train 1; 4 Light Blues → 2 in train 2; 3 Dark Reds → 1 in train 3).
  - Affected colors vary (Pink in train 1, Light Blue in train 2, Dark Red in train 3), but the same-color interaction is consistent.
  - Unaffected same-color components (e.g., large Greens in all trains) remain unchanged, suggesting interaction only among specific subsets (e.g., small/detached groups; exact subset rule unknown).

- **Position (bbox) affects transformation**:
  - Original positions (bbox) of interacting same-color components lead to removal.
  - The new same-color component has a **changed bbox** (different x/y coordinates), indicating position transformation.
  - New positions are consistently shifted relative to originals (e.g., often upward/lower y-values like y=0-2 in trains 2 and 3, or lateral like x=7-8 in train 1), but exact transformation rule (e.g., how original positions determine new ones) is unknown.
  - No interaction observed between positions of different colors.

- **Pixel count relates to aggregation, but transformation is unknown**:
  - Pixel counts of removed same-color components are aggregated in the sense that they "contribute" to the new component's creation.
  - The new component's pixel count is related to the removed ones' total (e.g., small counts like 1+1=2 in train 1), but not consistently preserved or directly summed (e.g., 4 total in train 2 preserved across new components; 7 total removed Dark Red pixels in train 3 → 3 in new, showing loss/gain). Exact aggregation or modification rule is unknown.

- **No consistent interactions involving holes, edges, silhouettes, or color changes**:
  - Holes=0 for all components in all inputs/outputs; no change or interaction observed (irrelevant).
  - No data on edges/holes/silhouettes affecting movement or transformation (unidentifiable from provided info).
  - No color-to-color interactions (e.g., no color shifts like Pink → Green); transformations stay within the same color.
  - No consistent position-to-color or hole-to-color effects.

- **Unchanged components show no interaction**:
  - Components that remain identical (same color, bbox, pixels) across input/output show no connection to transformations (e.g., large Yellow [2,2,6,4] pixels=9 in train 1; multi-pixel Pinks in train 3). These are isolated from the interacting groups.

Unknowns: Why specific subsets of same-color components are selected for interaction (e.g., only certain 1-pixel ones, or including multi-pixel like the 5-pixel Dark Red in train 3); exact new position calculation; pixel count modification logic. No forced connections beyond the above.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 14:15:35] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This is helpful for accurate 8-connectivity adjacency checks during component finding and attachment adjacency counting.)

```python

    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(This correctly identifies fixed border-touching components; essential for distinguishing movable small blobs.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]

                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))

                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately extracts all components per color using DFS/stack, enabling separation of small vs. large; reuse in future attempts.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)

    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These are helpful for aligning attachments and banners by centroid position; averages guide "closest" edge placement.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

(Averages for positioning; helpful for deciding attachment side/row/col, but can be imprecise for non-central blobs.)

            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union

(Unions multiple small comps into one set for group placement; dedups correctly.)

            return comp
    return []
```
(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on comparing the train input/output pairs, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **all three train examples**. These are limited to properties or elements that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in every case (e.g., via removal of some components and creation of new ones). Only consistent patterns are included; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., unchanged isolated 1-pixel blocks like the Pink at [0,2,0,2] in train 1 or Green at [1,5,1,5] in train 2) are excluded, as they show no interaction. Inconsistent or unexplainable aspects (e.g., exact relocation logic or pixel preservation) are noted as unknown. No high-level puzzle solution is attempted or implied.

- **Same-color components interact via merging/replacement**:
  - Multiple components (typically small/detached ones) of the **same color** are removed from their original positions.
  - A new component of the **same color** appears in the output, replacing the removed ones.
  - This reduces the total number of components for that color (e.g., 3 Pinks → 2 in train 1; 4 Light Blues → 2 in train 2; 3 Dark Reds → 1 in train 3).
  - Affected colors vary (Pink in train 1, Light Blue in train 2, Dark Red in train 3), but the same-color interaction is consistent.
  - Unaffected same-color components (e.g., large Greens in all trains) remain unchanged, suggesting interaction only among specific subsets (e.g., small/detached groups; exact subset rule unknown).

- **Position (bbox) affects transformation**:
  - Original positions (bbox) of interacting same-color components lead to removal.
  - The new same-color component has a **changed bbox** (different x/y coordinates), indicating position transformation.
  - New positions are consistently shifted relative to originals (e.g., often upward/lower y-values like y=0-2 in trains 2 and 3, or lateral like x=7-8 in train 1), but exact transformation rule (e.g., how original positions determine new ones) is unknown.
  - No interaction observed between positions of different colors.

- **Pixel count relates to aggregation, but transformation is unknown**:
  - Pixel counts of removed same-color components are aggregated in the sense that they "contribute" to the new component's creation.
  - The new component's pixel count is related to the removed ones' total (e.g., small counts like 1+1=2 in train 1), but not consistently preserved or directly summed (e.g., 4 total in train 2 preserved across new components; 7 total removed Dark Red pixels in train 3 → 3 in new, showing loss/gain). Exact aggregation or modification rule is unknown.

- **No consistent interactions involving holes, edges, silhouettes, or color changes**:
  - Holes=0 for all components in all inputs/outputs; no change or interaction observed (irrelevant).
  - No data on edges/holes/silhouettes affecting movement or transformation (unidentifiable from provided info).
  - No color-to-color interactions (e.g., no color shifts like Pink → Green); transformations stay within the same color.
  - No consistent position-to-color or hole-to-color effects.

- **Unchanged components show no interaction**:
  - Components that remain identical (same color, bbox, pixels) across input/output show no connection to transformations (e.g., large Yellow [2,2,6,4] pixels=9 in train 1; multi-pixel Pinks in train 3). These are isolated from the interacting groups.

Unknowns: Why specific subsets of same-color components are selected for interaction (e.g., only certain 1-pixel ones, or including multi-pixel like the 5-pixel Dark Red in train 3); exact new position calculation; pixel count modification logic. No forced connections beyond the above.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 14:22:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 14:23:30] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in all cases, without speculating on the underlying rule or attempting to explain transformations. Only elements with clear, repeated patterns of interaction (e.g., co-occurrence in changes) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., individual greens or yellows that never interact across examples, or hole counts that remain uniformly 0 with no effect) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., why pixel counts sometimes conserve and sometimes do not) are noted as such.

- **Same-color components (interconnection via color grouping)**: Disconnected components sharing the same color consistently interact as a group. In every example, multiple components of one or more specific colors are removed from their original positions, and at least one new component of the *exact same color* appears in a different position. Unaffected colors have no such grouping or changes. This color-based grouping is the only consistent trigger for any reconfiguration observed across all examples. (Note: Pixel conservation within the group is consistent in examples 1 and 2 but not in example 3—unknown reason.)

- **Position (bbox coordinates) and color**: The bbox position of a component directly affects whether it participates in color-group interactions. Components of interacting colors consistently change their bbox (e.g., shifting to new x/y ranges, often forming linear alignments like horizontal or vertical bars), while components of non-interacting colors retain their exact original bbox. No cross-color position effects are observed consistently.

- **Shape properties (pixels and bbox dimensions) within same-color groups**: Pixel count and bbox dimensions of same-color components are interconnected during interactions. When a color group is affected, the total configuration of pixels and bbox sizes for that color changes collectively (e.g., distributing pixels into a new bbox shape), but individual unaffected components retain their exact pixel count and bbox dimensions. This is consistent across all examples, though the specific reshaping (e.g., from scattered singles to a bar) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., cross-color effects, hole-related properties, or position-to-color changes without same-color grouping) are identifiable from the data. All examples show that only intra-color (same-color) interactions occur, with no evidence of broader compositional structures (e.g., frames enclosing others) affecting changes consistently across every case.

[2025-10-01 14:23:30] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

(These are helpful for aligning attachments and banners by centroid position; averages guide "closest" edge placement.)

    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:

            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

    if n == 0:
        return 0.0

```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three training examples, the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent across **every** puzzle. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in all cases, without speculating on the underlying rule or attempting to explain transformations. Only elements with clear, repeated patterns of interaction (e.g., co-occurrence in changes) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., individual greens or yellows that never interact across examples, or hole counts that remain uniformly 0 with no effect) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., why pixel counts sometimes conserve and sometimes do not) are noted as such.

- **Same-color components (interconnection via color grouping)**: Disconnected components sharing the same color consistently interact as a group. In every example, multiple components of one or more specific colors are removed from their original positions, and at least one new component of the *exact same color* appears in a different position. Unaffected colors have no such grouping or changes. This color-based grouping is the only consistent trigger for any reconfiguration observed across all examples. (Note: Pixel conservation within the group is consistent in examples 1 and 2 but not in example 3—unknown reason.)

- **Position (bbox coordinates) and color**: The bbox position of a component directly affects whether it participates in color-group interactions. Components of interacting colors consistently change their bbox (e.g., shifting to new x/y ranges, often forming linear alignments like horizontal or vertical bars), while components of non-interacting colors retain their exact original bbox. No cross-color position effects are observed consistently.

- **Shape properties (pixels and bbox dimensions) within same-color groups**: Pixel count and bbox dimensions of same-color components are interconnected during interactions. When a color group is affected, the total configuration of pixels and bbox sizes for that color changes collectively (e.g., distributing pixels into a new bbox shape), but individual unaffected components retain their exact pixel count and bbox dimensions. This is consistent across all examples, though the specific reshaping (e.g., from scattered singles to a bar) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., cross-color effects, hole-related properties, or position-to-color changes without same-color grouping) are identifiable from the data. All examples show that only intra-color (same-color) interactions occur, with no evidence of broader compositional structures (e.g., frames enclosing others) affecting changes consistently across every case.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:29:26] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]

def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)

def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors8(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This flood-fill extracts all components correctly, essential for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border(comp, rows, cols):
                small.append((color, comp))
    return small

def get_large_positions(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    large_pos: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            if len(comp) >= 8 or touches_border(comp, rows, cols):
                large_pos[color].extend(comp)
    return large_pos
```
(These correctly separate small from large/border components; large_pos unions all large parts per color, useful for averages/edges.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0: return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0: return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(Centroids via averages guide alignments; essential for deciding vertical vs horizontal and positions.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

[2025-10-01 14:29:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set

def get_neighbors8(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This is helpful for accurate 8-connectivity adjacency checks during component finding and attachment adjacency counting.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(This correctly identifies fixed border-touching components; essential for distinguishing movable small blobs.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors8(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately extracts all components per color using DFS/stack, enabling separation of small vs. large; reuse in future attempts.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These are helpful for aligning attachments and banners by centroid position; averages guide "closest" edge placement.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 14:37:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

```
(This find_components uses DFS stack for 8-connected blob extraction per color, essential for identifying all components accurately.)

```python

    return len(comp) >= 8 or touches_border(comp, rows, cols)

def get_large_pos(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    large_pos: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            if is_large(comp, rows, cols):
                large_pos[color].extend(comp)
    return large_pos

def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)

def compute_span(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = compute_min_max(pos)
    return max_r - min_r + 1 if pos else 0, max_c - min_c + 1 if pos else 0

def compute_average_row(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in pos) / n

def compute_average_col(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in pos) / n
```
(These define large blobs, extract positions, and compute stats like spans/averages for placement decisions; very helpful for positioning logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set

def get_neighbors8(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This is helpful for accurate 8-connectivity adjacency checks during component finding and attachment adjacency counting.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(This correctly identifies fixed border-touching components; essential for distinguishing movable small blobs.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors8(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately extracts all components per color using DFS/stack, enabling separation of small vs. large; reuse in future attempts.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These are helpful for aligning attachments and banners by centroid position; averages guide "closest" edge placement.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

```
(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

(These correctly separate small from large/border components; large_pos unions all large parts per color, useful for averages/edges.)

    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(Centroids via averages guide alignments; essential for deciding vertical vs horizontal and positions.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

(These define large blobs, extract positions, and compute stats like spans/averages for placement decisions; very helpful for positioning logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-01 14:47:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small, non-border-touching connected components ("blobs") of dynamic colors (non-3/4) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned either by attaching them linearly (horizontally or vertically, based on their original shape's aspect ratio) to the nearest or best-matching static anchor components (colors 3 or 4), or as vertical "banners" from the top edge if no suitable anchor exists. The goal is to preserve the overall visual structure while reorganizing these small dynamic blobs into clean, attached lines without overlaps or border violations, often resulting in more compact or symmetric forms in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way (orthogonal) connectivity for discovery, but 8-way (including diagonals) is used for adjacency checks to anchors—ensure consistency to avoid missing touches.
 * Only "small" components qualify for moving: defined as <8 cells and not touching any grid border (rows 0/last or cols 0/last); larger or border-touching blobs stay in place unchanged.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) act as primary anchors; dynamic colors (e.g., 2,6,7,8,9) are the ones to move—prioritize attaching to statics over other dynamics, and prefer lower-numbered or static anchors when multiple options exist based on adjacency count.
 * Placement logic: After removal, group small comps by their best anchor (most adjacent cells to it). Re-place as a single linear block matching the original component's span (row_span for vertical, col_span for horizontal). Prefer vertical placement if anchor is taller than wide (or vice versa for horizontal), attaching to the "opposite" side relative to the small comp's average position (e.g., if small comp was left of anchor avg, attach right). If blocked, clamp to grid edges or partially place vertically from top/bottom, but stop at obstacles—never overlap existing cells.
 * For no anchor (adjacency count 0), place as a vertical banner: start from top row (r=0) in the rounded average column of the original positions, filling downward until the full length is placed or grid ends; try nearby columns if blocked.
 * Subtleties: Averages (row/col) guide side preference and positioning—use them to select attachment rows/cols from the anchor's extent. Preserve original shape aspect (e.g., if original span is wider, try horizontal first). Multiple small comps sharing an anchor should be merged into one linear placement. Do not move statics or large/border blobs. Grid is copied deeply to avoid mutating originals during processing. Process dynamic colors in sorted order to handle priorities. Easy to miss: Partial placement only for vertical (clamping at top/bottom), not horizontal; banners always vertical from top, not bottom. Ensure no self-overlap after removal. Outputs must exactly match expected cell-by-cell, including zeros.

These functions are solid for component extraction, sizing, bordering, and averaging—core to identifying and characterizing movable blobs. Use them as building blocks.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid reusing):**
```python
def compute_best_anchor(pos_s: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], color_s: int, rows: int, cols: int, static_colors: Set[int]) -> int:
    # Broken: Sorts by static preference then color number, but doesn't handle ties well or prefer closest anchor; leads to wrong anchor selection in multi-anchor cases.

def place_horizontal(...):  # Partially broken: Doesn't clamp or partial-place if blocked, causing full failures; side selection based on avgs is good but row selection too rigid (uses sorted anchor rows but defaults poorly).

def place_vertical(...):  # Broken for 'above' side: Partial placement stops at blocks but doesn't guarantee full length if clamped; 'below' assumes full free space without partial option, missing expected partial fills.

def place_banner(...):  # Unhelpful as-is: Tries columns in order from avg_c but doesn't prioritize free space or handle horizontal spans; always vertical, but ignores original shape for banners.
```
These placement functions fail on edge cases like partial blocks, wrong side attachments, and banner positioning, leading to scattered or misplaced cells.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core placement logic is flawed despite good component detection.
 * Train 1: Successfully detected and removed small 6 and 7 comps (cleared originals), but placed 7 as a misplaced horizontal at top (row 0, cols 7-?) instead of vertical attachment below 3's at bottom (expected row 10, cols 1-2); 6's partially attached wrong to 4's (extra 6 at row 2 col 6-7, missing expected row 3 col 7-8 and row 10? wait, expected has 6's integrated differently—unknown why shapes don't match exactly, possibly due to wrong anchor or span calc).
 * Train 2: Detected small 9 and 6 comps but failed grouping/merging; 9's scattered horizontally/vertically (e.g., row 0 col 2, row 4 col 5) instead of stacked vertical banner on left (expected rows 0-2 col 2, row 2 col 7); 6's placed singly (row 0 col 7, row 4 col 6-7? partial) instead of horizontal attachments to 3's (expected row 4 col 7, row 5 col 6-7,8? etc., forming L-shape—mismatch in linearity).
 * Train 3: Removed small 7 and 6 but placed 7 as horizontal banner at bottom (row 5 cols 8-11) instead of vertical from top attached to nothing? (expected vertical col 5 rows 0-2 for 7? wait, expected has 7 vertical col 5 rows 0-2, and 6 reformed into snake across bottom); 6 ignored or not reattached properly (stays scattered, missing expected long horizontal/vertical extensions).
 * Component finding and removal work well (empties small non-border blobs correctly), but anchor selection often picks wrong (e.g., no anchor when one exists) or places on wrong side/orientation; merging multiple small comps into one linear block fails (treats separately?).
 * Banner fallback triggers too often and positions wrong (e.g., wrong column, horizontal instead of vertical).
 * No deep issues with grid copying or color sorting, but vertical partial placement is inconsistent (works sometimes but not for 'above').

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar flaws to training failures. Small comps like 9's (original scattered in rows 8-11) are partially removed but re-placed scattered (e.g., row 0 col 3? new, row 8 col 1, row 9 col 1+4, row 10 col 1+4, row 11 col 1+4) instead of likely a vertical banner from top in avg col ~4 or attached linearly to nearby static? (no 3/4 visible, so banner expected, but not consolidated vertical in one col); 2's (original row 3 cols 1-5, border-touching? wait, row 3 col1 touches left border, so shouldn't move—but generated moves to row 10 col 11-12? wrong, as border comps stay); 7's (row 11 col 2? small) placed at row 7 cols 0-1 (horizontal, bottom-left) instead of vertical banner or attachment; 8's partial (row 10 col 6-7, row 11 col 9) not linearized or attached (expected probably vertical from top in col ~7-9). 4's and other statics untouched (good), but overall grid has misplaced dynamics not forming clean lines—e.g., no attachment to 4 in row 3, and extras like row 0 col 8=2, col9=8 misplaced. This breaks rules: border-touching 2 shouldn't move; banners should be vertical top-down in single col; no partial scatters.

These functions are solid for component extraction, sizing, bordering, and averaging—core to identifying and characterizing movable blobs. Use them as building blocks.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid reusing):**
```python
def compute_best_anchor(pos_s: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], color_s: int, rows: int, cols: int, static_colors: Set[int]) -> int:
    # Broken: Sorts by static preference then color number, but doesn't handle ties well or prefer closest anchor; leads to wrong anchor selection in multi-anchor cases.

def place_horizontal(...):  # Partially broken: Doesn't clamp or partial-place if blocked, causing full failures; side selection based on avgs is good but row selection too rigid (uses sorted anchor rows but defaults poorly).

def place_vertical(...):  # Broken for 'above' side: Partial placement stops at blocks but doesn't guarantee full length if clamped; 'below' assumes full free space without partial option, missing expected partial fills.

def place_banner(...):  # Unhelpful as-is: Tries columns in order from avg_c but doesn't prioritize free space or handle horizontal spans; always vertical, but ignores original shape for banners.
```
These placement functions fail on edge cases like partial blocks, wrong side attachments, and banner positioning, leading to scattered or misplaced cells.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core placement logic is flawed despite good component detection.
 * Train 1: Successfully detected and removed small 6 and 7 comps (cleared originals), but placed 7 as a misplaced horizontal at top (row 0, cols 7-?) instead of vertical attachment below 3's at bottom (expected row 10, cols 1-2); 6's partially attached wrong to 4's (extra 6 at row 2 col 6-7, missing expected row 3 col 7-8 and row 10? wait, expected has 6's integrated differently—unknown why shapes don't match exactly, possibly due to wrong anchor or span calc).
 * Train 2: Detected small 9 and 6 comps but failed grouping/merging; 9's scattered horizontally/vertically (e.g., row 0 col 2, row 4 col 5) instead of stacked vertical banner on left (expected rows 0-2 col 2, row 2 col 7); 6's placed singly (row 0 col 7, row 4 col 6-7? partial) instead of horizontal attachments to 3's (expected row 4 col 7, row 5 col 6-7,8? etc., forming L-shape—mismatch in linearity).
 * Train 3: Removed small 7 and 6 but placed 7 as horizontal banner at bottom (row 5 cols 8-11) instead of vertical from top attached to nothing? (expected vertical col 5 rows 0-2 for 7? wait, expected has 7 vertical col 5 rows 0-2, and 6 reformed into snake across bottom); 6 ignored or not reattached properly (stays scattered, missing expected long horizontal/vertical extensions).
 * Component finding and removal work well (empties small non-border blobs correctly), but anchor selection often picks wrong (e.g., no anchor when one exists) or places on wrong side/orientation; merging multiple small comps into one linear block fails (treats separately?).
 * Banner fallback triggers too often and positions wrong (e.g., wrong column, horizontal instead of vertical).
 * No deep issues with grid copying or color sorting, but vertical partial placement is inconsistent (works sometimes but not for 'above').

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar flaws to training failures. Small comps like 9's (original scattered in rows 8-11) are partially removed but re-placed scattered (e.g., row 0 col 3? new, row 8 col 1, row 9 col 1+4, row 10 col 1+4, row 11 col 1+4) instead of likely a vertical banner from top in avg col ~4 or attached linearly to nearby static? (no 3/4 visible, so banner expected, but not consolidated vertical in one col); 2's (original row 3 cols 1-5, border-touching? wait, row 3 col1 touches left border, so shouldn't move—but generated moves to row 10 col 11-12? wrong, as border comps stay); 7's (row 11 col 2? small) placed at row 7 cols 0-1 (horizontal, bottom-left) instead of vertical banner or attachment; 8's partial (row 10 col 6-7, row 11 col 9) not linearized or attached (expected probably vertical from top in col ~7-9). 4's and other statics untouched (good), but overall grid has misplaced dynamics not forming clean lines—e.g., no attachment to 4 in row 3, and extras like row 0 col 8=2, col9=8 misplaced. This breaks rules: border-touching 2 shouldn't move; banners should be vertical top-down in single col; no partial scatters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```
(This correctly identifies fixed border-touching components; essential for distinguishing movable small blobs.)

def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:

                components[color].append(component)

```
(This is core and helpful: accurately extracts all components per color using DFS/stack, enabling separation of small vs. large; reuse in future attempts.)

def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)

    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:

```
(These are helpful for aligning attachments and banners by centroid position; averages guide "closest" edge placement.)

    seen = set()

            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

def get_large_pos(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], color: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    for comp in components.get(color, []):
        if len(comp) >= 8 or touches_border(comp, rows, cols):
            return comp
    return []
```
(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

(These define large blobs, extract positions, and compute stats like spans/averages for placement decisions; very helpful for positioning logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 14:56:23] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components (likely "floating" or temporary objects) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned according to rules like attaching them to larger "static" structures (colors 3 and 4) or placing them as vertical banners in optimal columns, simulating gravity, attachment, or alignment in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components using 8-directional neighborhood connectivity for same-color cells.
 * Distinguish "static" large or border-touching components (e.g., colors 3 and 4 are treated as anchors; components touching borders or >=8 cells are static and not moved).
 * Remove small dynamic components (<8 cells, not touching borders) entirely from the grid.
 * For re-placement: Prioritize attaching linear (horizontal span equals size) components to the nearest static color based on adjacency counts, placing them horizontally adjacent to the static structure's edge (left or right side based on average column position), at the row closest to the dynamic component's average row.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., blocked cells or non-linear shape), treat as "banners": Cluster by average column position (group if within <3 columns), compute row span, place vertically in the highest possible row band (aligned to max height of all banners), in a rounded average column, scanning ±5 columns for free space.
 * Subtleties: Attachments must check for blocking (non-zero cells in target positions); unions of multiple components per color/group when attaching; banners align to a global max height starting from top; prefer higher adjacency count for anchor choice, tie-break by lower color ID; linear check is strictly size == col_span (ignores row span, assumes horizontal linearity); empty or zero-size components return neutral bounds/averages; deep copy grid to avoid modifying original during processing.
 * Edge cases: Components with no adjacency default to banners; overlapping unions in attachments; vertical placements must fit within rows and not overlap existing cells; border-touching prevents movement even if small; colors beyond 3/4 are dynamic.
 * Potential misses: Directionality of attachment (e.g., always to the "outer" side?); shape preservation (current code flattens to lines or singles, may lose original form); gravity-like falling if no attachment; clustering threshold (3.0 units) may group unrelated banners; placement deltas (±5) might overshoot or miss optimal spots; no rotation or reshaping of components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small dynamic components (<8 cells, non-border-touching) while preserving static ones (3 and 4, or border-touching), using solid component extraction via DFS/stack and 8-connectivity.
 * Attachment logic partially works by counting adjacencies to static colors and unioning same-color groups, but fails in placement: In Training 1, the 6 (vertical line, size=3, col_span=1 != size so not linear) is removed but not reattached to the right of the 4 blob (expected at rows 3-4, cols 7-8 as [6,6] horizontal? Wait, expected shows single 6's at [2,0] and [3,7-8] but mismatched; generated places vertical 6's on left border rows 0-2 col0, and 7's (small L-shape?) on bottom right cols10-11 rows7-8, while expected has 6 at [2,0] (odd) and 6's at [3,7-8], 7's shifted left in row10 cols1-2 attached to 3's—unknown why 6 at [2,0] in expected, but generated ignores linearity for 6 and places wrongly on border.
 * In Training 2, removal works (9's and 6's cleared), but re-placement errs: Generated places vertical 9's on left cols0-1 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col3, 6 at row2 col2 (scattered), while expected attaches 9's as vertical on col2 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col7, 6's horizontally attached to 3's at rows4-5 cols6-8/9—generated treats 9's as attachable but picks wrong anchor/side, and 6's not attached properly (possibly banner-clustered wrong).
 * In Training 3, identifies 7 (vertical size=3<8, non-border) and 6 (large blob, static), removes 7 but places it vertically on left border cols0 rows0-2, while expected places it vertically on col5 rows0-2 attached right of where 7 was? (overlaps original position? No, expected shifts 7 right to col5, but 6 remains—wait, generated keeps 6 intact but misplaces 7 on wrong side; linearity check fails as col_span=1==size, but attachment to 6 (not static 3/4) ignored since only 3/4 are anchors.
 * Banner clustering sorts by avg col and groups if <3 apart, places vertically at max_h - span, scanning ±5 cols, but in Train1, 7's become banner but placed right (col10-11) instead of left-attached to 3's; in Train2, 6's/9's clustered wrong leading to left placements vs expected right/top.
 * Overall, worked: Component finding, removal, unioning, spans/averages, border checks. Didn't work: Anchor limited to 3/4 (Train3 needs attachment to 6?); linearity assumes horizontal only (verticals like 6/7/9 fail attachment); side choice (avg_c_s < avg_c_a picks left, but often needs right); placement ignores original shape (flattens to line/single col for banners); no fallback to borders or gravity; blocked checks prevent some but default to wrong banner spots; in Train1, can_place for 6 ignores vertical nature.
 * Function `get_anchor_positions` is helpful for static pos but limited to specific colors. The main `program` integrates all but has flawed decision tree (e.g., dynamic_small_comps append comp, but later union only for attachments).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It retains some original 2's (e.g., vertical at col4 rows0-1, horizontal at row2 cols5-9, scattered at row3 col10 and row4 cols5-9) but adds/modifies others (e.g., 2 at row3 col4? No, output shows partial 2's retained/repurposed, but introduces no clear attachments—4's at row3 cols6-8 untouched (static?), 9's/7/8 at bottom scattered/retained without removal, no banners placed; expected likely removes small 2's (the floating horizontal/vertical groups <8, non-border), attaches 2's to 4's (right side?), and handles bottom 7/8/9 as banners or attachments (e.g., 7 horizontal at row9 cols2-3 attached down from 9's? 8's vertical on right, 9's L-shape). Differences: No removal of small 2's (e.g., row2 cols5-9 should move), bottom components not repositioned (7/8/9/2 scattered as-is vs likely vertical banners in cols rounded to avg, e.g., 8's at col9-10 vertical, 7 at col2-3); 4's static ok, but no 2 attachment (e.g., expected 2's horizontal right of 4's at row3 cols9-?); overall, output looks like partial retention with minimal changes, missing core removal/replacement—does not make sense as it ignores dynamic rules for 2/7/8/9.

[2025-10-01 14:56:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small, non-border-touching connected components ("blobs") of dynamic colors (non-3/4) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned either by attaching them linearly (horizontally or vertically, based on their original shape's aspect ratio) to the nearest or best-matching static anchor components (colors 3 or 4), or as vertical "banners" from the top edge if no suitable anchor exists. The goal is to preserve the overall visual structure while reorganizing these small dynamic blobs into clean, attached lines without overlaps or border violations, often resulting in more compact or symmetric forms in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way (orthogonal) connectivity for discovery, but 8-way (including diagonals) is used for adjacency checks to anchors—ensure consistency to avoid missing touches.
 * Only "small" components qualify for moving: defined as <8 cells and not touching any grid border (rows 0/last or cols 0/last); larger or border-touching blobs stay in place unchanged.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) act as primary anchors; dynamic colors (e.g., 2,6,7,8,9) are the ones to move—prioritize attaching to statics over other dynamics, and prefer lower-numbered or static anchors when multiple options exist based on adjacency count.
 * Placement logic: After removal, group small comps by their best anchor (most adjacent cells to it). Re-place as a single linear block matching the original component's span (row_span for vertical, col_span for horizontal). Prefer vertical placement if anchor is taller than wide (or vice versa for horizontal), attaching to the "opposite" side relative to the small comp's average position (e.g., if small comp was left of anchor avg, attach right). If blocked, clamp to grid edges or partially place vertically from top/bottom, but stop at obstacles—never overlap existing cells.
 * For no anchor (adjacency count 0), place as a vertical banner: start from top row (r=0) in the rounded average column of the original positions, filling downward until the full length is placed or grid ends; try nearby columns if blocked.
 * Subtleties: Averages (row/col) guide side preference and positioning—use them to select attachment rows/cols from the anchor's extent. Preserve original shape aspect (e.g., if original span is wider, try horizontal first). Multiple small comps sharing an anchor should be merged into one linear placement. Do not move statics or large/border blobs. Grid is copied deeply to avoid mutating originals during processing. Process dynamic colors in sorted order to handle priorities. Easy to miss: Partial placement only for vertical (clamping at top/bottom), not horizontal; banners always vertical from top, not bottom. Ensure no self-overlap after removal. Outputs must exactly match expected cell-by-cell, including zeros.

            if g[r][c] == color:
                pos.append((r, c))
    return pos
```
These functions are solid for component extraction, sizing, bordering, and averaging—core to identifying and characterizing movable blobs. Use them as building blocks.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid reusing):**
```python
def compute_best_anchor(pos_s: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], color_s: int, rows: int, cols: int, static_colors: Set[int]) -> int:
    # Broken: Sorts by static preference then color number, but doesn't handle ties well or prefer closest anchor; leads to wrong anchor selection in multi-anchor cases.

def place_horizontal(...):  # Partially broken: Doesn't clamp or partial-place if blocked, causing full failures; side selection based on avgs is good but row selection too rigid (uses sorted anchor rows but defaults poorly).

def place_vertical(...):  # Broken for 'above' side: Partial placement stops at blocks but doesn't guarantee full length if clamped; 'below' assumes full free space without partial option, missing expected partial fills.

def place_banner(...):  # Unhelpful as-is: Tries columns in order from avg_c but doesn't prioritize free space or handle horizontal spans; always vertical, but ignores original shape for banners.
```
These placement functions fail on edge cases like partial blocks, wrong side attachments, and banner positioning, leading to scattered or misplaced cells.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core placement logic is flawed despite good component detection.
 * Train 1: Successfully detected and removed small 6 and 7 comps (cleared originals), but placed 7 as a misplaced horizontal at top (row 0, cols 7-?) instead of vertical attachment below 3's at bottom (expected row 10, cols 1-2); 6's partially attached wrong to 4's (extra 6 at row 2 col 6-7, missing expected row 3 col 7-8 and row 10? wait, expected has 6's integrated differently—unknown why shapes don't match exactly, possibly due to wrong anchor or span calc).
 * Train 2: Detected small 9 and 6 comps but failed grouping/merging; 9's scattered horizontally/vertically (e.g., row 0 col 2, row 4 col 5) instead of stacked vertical banner on left (expected rows 0-2 col 2, row 2 col 7); 6's placed singly (row 0 col 7, row 4 col 6-7? partial) instead of horizontal attachments to 3's (expected row 4 col 7, row 5 col 6-7,8? etc., forming L-shape—mismatch in linearity).
 * Train 3: Removed small 7 and 6 but placed 7 as horizontal banner at bottom (row 5 cols 8-11) instead of vertical from top attached to nothing? (expected vertical col 5 rows 0-2 for 7? wait, expected has 7 vertical col 5 rows 0-2, and 6 reformed into snake across bottom); 6 ignored or not reattached properly (stays scattered, missing expected long horizontal/vertical extensions).
 * Component finding and removal work well (empties small non-border blobs correctly), but anchor selection often picks wrong (e.g., no anchor when one exists) or places on wrong side/orientation; merging multiple small comps into one linear block fails (treats separately?).
 * Banner fallback triggers too often and positions wrong (e.g., wrong column, horizontal instead of vertical).
 * No deep issues with grid copying or color sorting, but vertical partial placement is inconsistent (works sometimes but not for 'above').

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar flaws to training failures. Small comps like 9's (original scattered in rows 8-11) are partially removed but re-placed scattered (e.g., row 0 col 3? new, row 8 col 1, row 9 col 1+4, row 10 col 1+4, row 11 col 1+4) instead of likely a vertical banner from top in avg col ~4 or attached linearly to nearby static? (no 3/4 visible, so banner expected, but not consolidated vertical in one col); 2's (original row 3 cols 1-5, border-touching? wait, row 3 col1 touches left border, so shouldn't move—but generated moves to row 10 col 11-12? wrong, as border comps stay); 7's (row 11 col 2? small) placed at row 7 cols 0-1 (horizontal, bottom-left) instead of vertical banner or attachment; 8's partial (row 10 col 6-7, row 11 col 9) not linearized or attached (expected probably vertical from top in col ~7-9). 4's and other statics untouched (good), but overall grid has misplaced dynamics not forming clean lines—e.g., no attachment to 4 in row 3, and extras like row 0 col 8=2, col9=8 misplaced. This breaks rules: border-touching 2 shouldn't move; banners should be vertical top-down in single col; no partial scatters.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(This correctly identifies fixed border-touching components; essential for distinguishing movable small blobs.)

                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is core and helpful: accurately extracts all components per color using DFS/stack, enabling separation of small vs. large; reuse in future attempts.)

def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:

    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These are helpful for aligning attachments and banners by centroid position; averages guide "closest" edge placement.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components (likely "floating" or temporary objects) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned according to rules like attaching them to larger "static" structures (colors 3 and 4) or placing them as vertical banners in optimal columns, simulating gravity, attachment, or alignment in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components using 8-directional neighborhood connectivity for same-color cells.
 * Distinguish "static" large or border-touching components (e.g., colors 3 and 4 are treated as anchors; components touching borders or >=8 cells are static and not moved).
 * Remove small dynamic components (<8 cells, not touching borders) entirely from the grid.
 * For re-placement: Prioritize attaching linear (horizontal span equals size) components to the nearest static color based on adjacency counts, placing them horizontally adjacent to the static structure's edge (left or right side based on average column position), at the row closest to the dynamic component's average row.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., blocked cells or non-linear shape), treat as "banners": Cluster by average column position (group if within <3 columns), compute row span, place vertically in the highest possible row band (aligned to max height of all banners), in a rounded average column, scanning ±5 columns for free space.
 * Subtleties: Attachments must check for blocking (non-zero cells in target positions); unions of multiple components per color/group when attaching; banners align to a global max height starting from top; prefer higher adjacency count for anchor choice, tie-break by lower color ID; linear check is strictly size == col_span (ignores row span, assumes horizontal linearity); empty or zero-size components return neutral bounds/averages; deep copy grid to avoid modifying original during processing.
 * Edge cases: Components with no adjacency default to banners; overlapping unions in attachments; vertical placements must fit within rows and not overlap existing cells; border-touching prevents movement even if small; colors beyond 3/4 are dynamic.
 * Potential misses: Directionality of attachment (e.g., always to the "outer" side?); shape preservation (current code flattens to lines or singles, may lose original form); gravity-like falling if no attachment; clustering threshold (3.0 units) may group unrelated banners; placement deltas (±5) might overshoot or miss optimal spots; no rotation or reshaping of components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small dynamic components (<8 cells, non-border-touching) while preserving static ones (3 and 4, or border-touching), using solid component extraction via DFS/stack and 8-connectivity.
 * Attachment logic partially works by counting adjacencies to static colors and unioning same-color groups, but fails in placement: In Training 1, the 6 (vertical line, size=3, col_span=1 != size so not linear) is removed but not reattached to the right of the 4 blob (expected at rows 3-4, cols 7-8 as [6,6] horizontal? Wait, expected shows single 6's at [2,0] and [3,7-8] but mismatched; generated places vertical 6's on left border rows 0-2 col0, and 7's (small L-shape?) on bottom right cols10-11 rows7-8, while expected has 6 at [2,0] (odd) and 6's at [3,7-8], 7's shifted left in row10 cols1-2 attached to 3's—unknown why 6 at [2,0] in expected, but generated ignores linearity for 6 and places wrongly on border.
 * In Training 2, removal works (9's and 6's cleared), but re-placement errs: Generated places vertical 9's on left cols0-1 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col3, 6 at row2 col2 (scattered), while expected attaches 9's as vertical on col2 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col7, 6's horizontally attached to 3's at rows4-5 cols6-8/9—generated treats 9's as attachable but picks wrong anchor/side, and 6's not attached properly (possibly banner-clustered wrong).
 * In Training 3, identifies 7 (vertical size=3<8, non-border) and 6 (large blob, static), removes 7 but places it vertically on left border cols0 rows0-2, while expected places it vertically on col5 rows0-2 attached right of where 7 was? (overlaps original position? No, expected shifts 7 right to col5, but 6 remains—wait, generated keeps 6 intact but misplaces 7 on wrong side; linearity check fails as col_span=1==size, but attachment to 6 (not static 3/4) ignored since only 3/4 are anchors.
 * Banner clustering sorts by avg col and groups if <3 apart, places vertically at max_h - span, scanning ±5 cols, but in Train1, 7's become banner but placed right (col10-11) instead of left-attached to 3's; in Train2, 6's/9's clustered wrong leading to left placements vs expected right/top.
 * Overall, worked: Component finding, removal, unioning, spans/averages, border checks. Didn't work: Anchor limited to 3/4 (Train3 needs attachment to 6?); linearity assumes horizontal only (verticals like 6/7/9 fail attachment); side choice (avg_c_s < avg_c_a picks left, but often needs right); placement ignores original shape (flattens to line/single col for banners); no fallback to borders or gravity; blocked checks prevent some but default to wrong banner spots; in Train1, can_place for 6 ignores vertical nature.
 * Function `get_anchor_positions` is helpful for static pos but limited to specific colors. The main `program` integrates all but has flawed decision tree (e.g., dynamic_small_comps append comp, but later union only for attachments).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It retains some original 2's (e.g., vertical at col4 rows0-1, horizontal at row2 cols5-9, scattered at row3 col10 and row4 cols5-9) but adds/modifies others (e.g., 2 at row3 col4? No, output shows partial 2's retained/repurposed, but introduces no clear attachments—4's at row3 cols6-8 untouched (static?), 9's/7/8 at bottom scattered/retained without removal, no banners placed; expected likely removes small 2's (the floating horizontal/vertical groups <8, non-border), attaches 2's to 4's (right side?), and handles bottom 7/8/9 as banners or attachments (e.g., 7 horizontal at row9 cols2-3 attached down from 9's? 8's vertical on right, 9's L-shape). Differences: No removal of small 2's (e.g., row2 cols5-9 should move), bottom components not repositioned (7/8/9/2 scattered as-is vs likely vertical banners in cols rounded to avg, e.g., 8's at col9-10 vertical, 7 at col2-3); 4's static ok, but no 2 attachment (e.g., expected 2's horizontal right of 4's at row3 cols9-?); overall, output looks like partial retention with minimal changes, missing core removal/replacement—does not make sense as it ignores dynamic rules for 2/7/8/9.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

(These define large blobs, extract positions, and compute stats like spans/averages for placement decisions; very helpful for positioning logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import math

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 15:06:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where connected components of the same color are identified and classified as static/large (if color 3 or 4, size >=8, or touching the border) or small/movable (otherwise). Small components are removed and then repositioned either by attaching them as horizontal or vertical banners to the edges of adjacent large components (preferring orientation based on their shape) or, if unplaced, as vertical banners sorted by average column position at the top of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood fill to find connected groups.
 * Static/large components stay in place; small ones are erased first, then placed without overlapping anything.
 * For attachment: Prefer horizontal placement if the small component spans more columns than rows (or equal, default to horizontal); vertical otherwise. Align to the edge of the large component (left/right or top/bottom) based on average positions, using candidate rows/columns from the anchor's edge, sorted by proximity to the small's average.
 * For vertical attachment, if the preferred side (above/below based on averages) fails due to space or overlap, try the opposite side.
 * Unplaced smalls form "banner groups" unioned by best anchor color; if no anchor, treat as free-floating. Place free or unattachable groups as vertical banners at the top, starting from a height based on the max length of such groups, centered roughly on their average column (with delta trials for fitting).
 * Subtlety: Banners must fit exactly in free space (all zeros) without partial overlaps; length is based on distinct rows/cols in the union. Sorting banners by average column ensures left-to-right order.
 * Edge cases: Empty components return defaults (e.g., avg 0); ensure bounds checking for placements. Groups with same anchor and color are unioned before placement.
 * When placing banners at top, the start row is max_h - length, but max_h is max distinct rows of banners—ensures they stack without overlap, but may clip if too tall (though grids seem to fit).
 * Adjacency for anchoring counts neighboring large cells (8-dir) to choose best anchor by max touches; only anchor if large and >0 touches.
 * Potential miss: In vertical placement fallback, the code has a nested loop that breaks correctly only if placed, but may skip some candidates if outer loop breaks prematurely.
 * All placements use the original small color; no color changes.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set

def get_neighbors8(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This is helpful for 8-connected neighborhood in component finding and adjacency counting.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors8(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is essential for correctly extracting 8-connected components per color; uses DFS stack for efficiency.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(Helpful for classifying border-touching components as static/large.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(Useful for merging positions of grouped small components before computing averages or shapes.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n

def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(These are helpful for determining placement sides (e.g., avg positions for left/right) and bounds for edge alignment; min/max useful for edge refs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles component extraction and classification (static if color 3/4, size >=8, or border-touching; smalls otherwise), as evidenced by training 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * Training 1 correct: All smalls placed properly, likely attached or as banners matching expected.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places two 9s horizontally at top-left (rows 0-2, cols 2-2 but duplicated), and 6s incorrectly (one at row2 col7, others scattered at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8) instead of expected (9s vertical at col2 rows0-2 and one at row2 col7; 6s more integrated at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8 but with an extra at row2 col7 as 9? Wait, expected has 9 at row2 col7, 6s starting row3 col7 downward rightward—mismatch in 6 placement positions and missing integration; unknown why horizontal preference failed for 9s or why 6s didn't attach vertically to 3s properly).
 * Training 3 correct: Placements matched, suggesting vertical/horizontal logic works for some shapes/anchors.
 * Attempt groups smalls by best anchor (max adjacent large color), unions them, and prefers orientation (horizontal if wider), but in training 2, this led to misplacement of 9s (treated as horizontal banner?) and 6s (partial attachment but wrong side/position).
 * Banner fallback at top sorts by avg col and trials deltas/signs for fitting, but in training 2, it placed 9s too clustered/left without proper vertical stacking, and 6s overlapped or ignored anchor.
 * The vertical placement fallback (trying opposite side) is included but buggy in training 2—code has nested loops that may not fully explore candidates, leading to unplaced 6s defaulting incorrectly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., neighbors, components) are relevant, though the main program logic needs tuning for side selection and candidate sorting.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 2s in a scattered way (e.g., top rows have 2s at col10-11 row0, col7/10 row1, dense row2 cols5-9, row3 col10, row4 cols5-9) which seems like partial re-placement of a large 2 blob, but likely incorrect as it doesn't erase and reattach smalls properly—appears to leave some original positions or fail unioning, resulting in non-contiguous banners; expected should erase small 2s/others, attach to large 4 (at row3 cols6-8?) perhaps vertically below, and place 9/7/8 as banners or attachments to borders/statics, but output has 9s/7s/8s mostly original with no clear movement (e.g., 9s at rows7-11 cols1-4/8, 7s row9-11 col2-3, 8s row7-11 col9-11)—no top banners visible, suggesting attachment logic failed for most smalls, leaving grid almost unchanged except top 2s messed up; this does not make sense as smalls like isolated 9s/7s/8 should move/attach, and 2s should form clean banners.

[2025-10-01 15:06:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small, non-border-touching connected components ("blobs") of dynamic colors (non-3/4) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned either by attaching them linearly (horizontally or vertically, based on their original shape's aspect ratio) to the nearest or best-matching static anchor components (colors 3 or 4), or as vertical "banners" from the top edge if no suitable anchor exists. The goal is to preserve the overall visual structure while reorganizing these small dynamic blobs into clean, attached lines without overlaps or border violations, often resulting in more compact or symmetric forms in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way (orthogonal) connectivity for discovery, but 8-way (including diagonals) is used for adjacency checks to anchors—ensure consistency to avoid missing touches.
 * Only "small" components qualify for moving: defined as <8 cells and not touching any grid border (rows 0/last or cols 0/last); larger or border-touching blobs stay in place unchanged.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) act as primary anchors; dynamic colors (e.g., 2,6,7,8,9) are the ones to move—prioritize attaching to statics over other dynamics, and prefer lower-numbered or static anchors when multiple options exist based on adjacency count.
 * Placement logic: After removal, group small comps by their best anchor (most adjacent cells to it). Re-place as a single linear block matching the original component's span (row_span for vertical, col_span for horizontal). Prefer vertical placement if anchor is taller than wide (or vice versa for horizontal), attaching to the "opposite" side relative to the small comp's average position (e.g., if small comp was left of anchor avg, attach right). If blocked, clamp to grid edges or partially place vertically from top/bottom, but stop at obstacles—never overlap existing cells.
 * For no anchor (adjacency count 0), place as a vertical banner: start from top row (r=0) in the rounded average column of the original positions, filling downward until the full length is placed or grid ends; try nearby columns if blocked.
 * Subtleties: Averages (row/col) guide side preference and positioning—use them to select attachment rows/cols from the anchor's extent. Preserve original shape aspect (e.g., if original span is wider, try horizontal first). Multiple small comps sharing an anchor should be merged into one linear placement. Do not move statics or large/border blobs. Grid is copied deeply to avoid mutating originals during processing. Process dynamic colors in sorted order to handle priorities. Easy to miss: Partial placement only for vertical (clamping at top/bottom), not horizontal; banners always vertical from top, not bottom. Ensure no self-overlap after removal. Outputs must exactly match expected cell-by-cell, including zeros.

These functions are solid for component extraction, sizing, bordering, and averaging—core to identifying and characterizing movable blobs. Use them as building blocks.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid reusing):**
```python
def compute_best_anchor(pos_s: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], color_s: int, rows: int, cols: int, static_colors: Set[int]) -> int:
    # Broken: Sorts by static preference then color number, but doesn't handle ties well or prefer closest anchor; leads to wrong anchor selection in multi-anchor cases.

def place_horizontal(...):  # Partially broken: Doesn't clamp or partial-place if blocked, causing full failures; side selection based on avgs is good but row selection too rigid (uses sorted anchor rows but defaults poorly).

def place_vertical(...):  # Broken for 'above' side: Partial placement stops at blocks but doesn't guarantee full length if clamped; 'below' assumes full free space without partial option, missing expected partial fills.

def place_banner(...):  # Unhelpful as-is: Tries columns in order from avg_c but doesn't prioritize free space or handle horizontal spans; always vertical, but ignores original shape for banners.
```
These placement functions fail on edge cases like partial blocks, wrong side attachments, and banner positioning, leading to scattered or misplaced cells.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core placement logic is flawed despite good component detection.
 * Train 1: Successfully detected and removed small 6 and 7 comps (cleared originals), but placed 7 as a misplaced horizontal at top (row 0, cols 7-?) instead of vertical attachment below 3's at bottom (expected row 10, cols 1-2); 6's partially attached wrong to 4's (extra 6 at row 2 col 6-7, missing expected row 3 col 7-8 and row 10? wait, expected has 6's integrated differently—unknown why shapes don't match exactly, possibly due to wrong anchor or span calc).
 * Train 2: Detected small 9 and 6 comps but failed grouping/merging; 9's scattered horizontally/vertically (e.g., row 0 col 2, row 4 col 5) instead of stacked vertical banner on left (expected rows 0-2 col 2, row 2 col 7); 6's placed singly (row 0 col 7, row 4 col 6-7? partial) instead of horizontal attachments to 3's (expected row 4 col 7, row 5 col 6-7,8? etc., forming L-shape—mismatch in linearity).
 * Train 3: Removed small 7 and 6 but placed 7 as horizontal banner at bottom (row 5 cols 8-11) instead of vertical from top attached to nothing? (expected vertical col 5 rows 0-2 for 7? wait, expected has 7 vertical col 5 rows 0-2, and 6 reformed into snake across bottom); 6 ignored or not reattached properly (stays scattered, missing expected long horizontal/vertical extensions).
 * Component finding and removal work well (empties small non-border blobs correctly), but anchor selection often picks wrong (e.g., no anchor when one exists) or places on wrong side/orientation; merging multiple small comps into one linear block fails (treats separately?).
 * Banner fallback triggers too often and positions wrong (e.g., wrong column, horizontal instead of vertical).
 * No deep issues with grid copying or color sorting, but vertical partial placement is inconsistent (works sometimes but not for 'above').

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar flaws to training failures. Small comps like 9's (original scattered in rows 8-11) are partially removed but re-placed scattered (e.g., row 0 col 3? new, row 8 col 1, row 9 col 1+4, row 10 col 1+4, row 11 col 1+4) instead of likely a vertical banner from top in avg col ~4 or attached linearly to nearby static? (no 3/4 visible, so banner expected, but not consolidated vertical in one col); 2's (original row 3 cols 1-5, border-touching? wait, row 3 col1 touches left border, so shouldn't move—but generated moves to row 10 col 11-12? wrong, as border comps stay); 7's (row 11 col 2? small) placed at row 7 cols 0-1 (horizontal, bottom-left) instead of vertical banner or attachment; 8's partial (row 10 col 6-7, row 11 col 9) not linearized or attached (expected probably vertical from top in col ~7-9). 4's and other statics untouched (good), but overall grid has misplaced dynamics not forming clean lines—e.g., no attachment to 4 in row 3, and extras like row 0 col 8=2, col9=8 misplaced. This breaks rules: border-touching 2 shouldn't move; banners should be vertical top-down in single col; no partial scatters.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components (likely "floating" or temporary objects) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned according to rules like attaching them to larger "static" structures (colors 3 and 4) or placing them as vertical banners in optimal columns, simulating gravity, attachment, or alignment in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components using 8-directional neighborhood connectivity for same-color cells.
 * Distinguish "static" large or border-touching components (e.g., colors 3 and 4 are treated as anchors; components touching borders or >=8 cells are static and not moved).
 * Remove small dynamic components (<8 cells, not touching borders) entirely from the grid.
 * For re-placement: Prioritize attaching linear (horizontal span equals size) components to the nearest static color based on adjacency counts, placing them horizontally adjacent to the static structure's edge (left or right side based on average column position), at the row closest to the dynamic component's average row.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., blocked cells or non-linear shape), treat as "banners": Cluster by average column position (group if within <3 columns), compute row span, place vertically in the highest possible row band (aligned to max height of all banners), in a rounded average column, scanning ±5 columns for free space.
 * Subtleties: Attachments must check for blocking (non-zero cells in target positions); unions of multiple components per color/group when attaching; banners align to a global max height starting from top; prefer higher adjacency count for anchor choice, tie-break by lower color ID; linear check is strictly size == col_span (ignores row span, assumes horizontal linearity); empty or zero-size components return neutral bounds/averages; deep copy grid to avoid modifying original during processing.
 * Edge cases: Components with no adjacency default to banners; overlapping unions in attachments; vertical placements must fit within rows and not overlap existing cells; border-touching prevents movement even if small; colors beyond 3/4 are dynamic.
 * Potential misses: Directionality of attachment (e.g., always to the "outer" side?); shape preservation (current code flattens to lines or singles, may lose original form); gravity-like falling if no attachment; clustering threshold (3.0 units) may group unrelated banners; placement deltas (±5) might overshoot or miss optimal spots; no rotation or reshaping of components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small dynamic components (<8 cells, non-border-touching) while preserving static ones (3 and 4, or border-touching), using solid component extraction via DFS/stack and 8-connectivity.
 * Attachment logic partially works by counting adjacencies to static colors and unioning same-color groups, but fails in placement: In Training 1, the 6 (vertical line, size=3, col_span=1 != size so not linear) is removed but not reattached to the right of the 4 blob (expected at rows 3-4, cols 7-8 as [6,6] horizontal? Wait, expected shows single 6's at [2,0] and [3,7-8] but mismatched; generated places vertical 6's on left border rows 0-2 col0, and 7's (small L-shape?) on bottom right cols10-11 rows7-8, while expected has 6 at [2,0] (odd) and 6's at [3,7-8], 7's shifted left in row10 cols1-2 attached to 3's—unknown why 6 at [2,0] in expected, but generated ignores linearity for 6 and places wrongly on border.
 * In Training 2, removal works (9's and 6's cleared), but re-placement errs: Generated places vertical 9's on left cols0-1 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col3, 6 at row2 col2 (scattered), while expected attaches 9's as vertical on col2 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col7, 6's horizontally attached to 3's at rows4-5 cols6-8/9—generated treats 9's as attachable but picks wrong anchor/side, and 6's not attached properly (possibly banner-clustered wrong).
 * In Training 3, identifies 7 (vertical size=3<8, non-border) and 6 (large blob, static), removes 7 but places it vertically on left border cols0 rows0-2, while expected places it vertically on col5 rows0-2 attached right of where 7 was? (overlaps original position? No, expected shifts 7 right to col5, but 6 remains—wait, generated keeps 6 intact but misplaces 7 on wrong side; linearity check fails as col_span=1==size, but attachment to 6 (not static 3/4) ignored since only 3/4 are anchors.
 * Banner clustering sorts by avg col and groups if <3 apart, places vertically at max_h - span, scanning ±5 cols, but in Train1, 7's become banner but placed right (col10-11) instead of left-attached to 3's; in Train2, 6's/9's clustered wrong leading to left placements vs expected right/top.
 * Overall, worked: Component finding, removal, unioning, spans/averages, border checks. Didn't work: Anchor limited to 3/4 (Train3 needs attachment to 6?); linearity assumes horizontal only (verticals like 6/7/9 fail attachment); side choice (avg_c_s < avg_c_a picks left, but often needs right); placement ignores original shape (flattens to line/single col for banners); no fallback to borders or gravity; blocked checks prevent some but default to wrong banner spots; in Train1, can_place for 6 ignores vertical nature.
 * Function `get_anchor_positions` is helpful for static pos but limited to specific colors. The main `program` integrates all but has flawed decision tree (e.g., dynamic_small_comps append comp, but later union only for attachments).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It retains some original 2's (e.g., vertical at col4 rows0-1, horizontal at row2 cols5-9, scattered at row3 col10 and row4 cols5-9) but adds/modifies others (e.g., 2 at row3 col4? No, output shows partial 2's retained/repurposed, but introduces no clear attachments—4's at row3 cols6-8 untouched (static?), 9's/7/8 at bottom scattered/retained without removal, no banners placed; expected likely removes small 2's (the floating horizontal/vertical groups <8, non-border), attaches 2's to 4's (right side?), and handles bottom 7/8/9 as banners or attachments (e.g., 7 horizontal at row9 cols2-3 attached down from 9's? 8's vertical on right, 9's L-shape). Differences: No removal of small 2's (e.g., row2 cols5-9 should move), bottom components not repositioned (7/8/9/2 scattered as-is vs likely vertical banners in cols rounded to avg, e.g., 8's at col9-10 vertical, 7 at col2-3); 4's static ok, but no 2 attachment (e.g., expected 2's horizontal right of 4's at row3 cols9-?); overall, output looks like partial retention with minimal changes, missing core removal/replacement—does not make sense as it ignores dynamic rules for 2/7/8/9.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where connected components of the same color are identified and classified as static/large (if color 3 or 4, size >=8, or touching the border) or small/movable (otherwise). Small components are removed and then repositioned either by attaching them as horizontal or vertical banners to the edges of adjacent large components (preferring orientation based on their shape) or, if unplaced, as vertical banners sorted by average column position at the top of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood fill to find connected groups.
 * Static/large components stay in place; small ones are erased first, then placed without overlapping anything.
 * For attachment: Prefer horizontal placement if the small component spans more columns than rows (or equal, default to horizontal); vertical otherwise. Align to the edge of the large component (left/right or top/bottom) based on average positions, using candidate rows/columns from the anchor's edge, sorted by proximity to the small's average.
 * For vertical attachment, if the preferred side (above/below based on averages) fails due to space or overlap, try the opposite side.
 * Unplaced smalls form "banner groups" unioned by best anchor color; if no anchor, treat as free-floating. Place free or unattachable groups as vertical banners at the top, starting from a height based on the max length of such groups, centered roughly on their average column (with delta trials for fitting).
 * Subtlety: Banners must fit exactly in free space (all zeros) without partial overlaps; length is based on distinct rows/cols in the union. Sorting banners by average column ensures left-to-right order.
 * Edge cases: Empty components return defaults (e.g., avg 0); ensure bounds checking for placements. Groups with same anchor and color are unioned before placement.
 * When placing banners at top, the start row is max_h - length, but max_h is max distinct rows of banners—ensures they stack without overlap, but may clip if too tall (though grids seem to fit).
 * Adjacency for anchoring counts neighboring large cells (8-dir) to choose best anchor by max touches; only anchor if large and >0 touches.
 * Potential miss: In vertical placement fallback, the code has a nested loop that breaks correctly only if placed, but may skip some candidates if outer loop breaks prematurely.
 * All placements use the original small color; no color changes.

                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True

```
(Helpful for classifying border-touching components as static/large.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(Useful for merging positions of grouped small components before computing averages or shapes.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n

def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(These are helpful for determining placement sides (e.g., avg positions for left/right) and bounds for edge alignment; min/max useful for edge refs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles component extraction and classification (static if color 3/4, size >=8, or border-touching; smalls otherwise), as evidenced by training 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * Training 1 correct: All smalls placed properly, likely attached or as banners matching expected.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places two 9s horizontally at top-left (rows 0-2, cols 2-2 but duplicated), and 6s incorrectly (one at row2 col7, others scattered at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8) instead of expected (9s vertical at col2 rows0-2 and one at row2 col7; 6s more integrated at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8 but with an extra at row2 col7 as 9? Wait, expected has 9 at row2 col7, 6s starting row3 col7 downward rightward—mismatch in 6 placement positions and missing integration; unknown why horizontal preference failed for 9s or why 6s didn't attach vertically to 3s properly).
 * Training 3 correct: Placements matched, suggesting vertical/horizontal logic works for some shapes/anchors.
 * Attempt groups smalls by best anchor (max adjacent large color), unions them, and prefers orientation (horizontal if wider), but in training 2, this led to misplacement of 9s (treated as horizontal banner?) and 6s (partial attachment but wrong side/position).
 * Banner fallback at top sorts by avg col and trials deltas/signs for fitting, but in training 2, it placed 9s too clustered/left without proper vertical stacking, and 6s overlapped or ignored anchor.
 * The vertical placement fallback (trying opposite side) is included but buggy in training 2—code has nested loops that may not fully explore candidates, leading to unplaced 6s defaulting incorrectly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., neighbors, components) are relevant, though the main program logic needs tuning for side selection and candidate sorting.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 2s in a scattered way (e.g., top rows have 2s at col10-11 row0, col7/10 row1, dense row2 cols5-9, row3 col10, row4 cols5-9) which seems like partial re-placement of a large 2 blob, but likely incorrect as it doesn't erase and reattach smalls properly—appears to leave some original positions or fail unioning, resulting in non-contiguous banners; expected should erase small 2s/others, attach to large 4 (at row3 cols6-8?) perhaps vertically below, and place 9/7/8 as banners or attachments to borders/statics, but output has 9s/7s/8s mostly original with no clear movement (e.g., 9s at rows7-11 cols1-4/8, 7s row9-11 col2-3, 8s row7-11 col9-11)—no top banners visible, suggesting attachment logic failed for most smalls, leaving grid almost unchanged except top 2s messed up; this does not make sense as smalls like isolated 9s/7s/8 should move/attach, and 2s should form clean banners.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:23:21] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (represented by numbers) where small, non-border-touching connected groups of cells (size <8) are relocated or "absorbed" by attaching them to the edges of larger, static, or border-touching components (colors 3 and 4 are explicitly static), or placed as vertical/horizontal "banners" in empty space if no attachment is possible; the goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches an expected layout, likely simulating growth, merging, or reorganization rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for identification, but 8-connected (including diagonals) is used for adjacency checks when deciding attachments, which could lead to overcounting neighbors if not careful.
 * Static colors (3,4) and large components (>=8 cells) or those touching the grid border are "fixed" and cannot be moved; small components (1-7 cells, interior only) are candidates for relocation.
 * Relocation prefers attachment to the nearest fixed component based on adjacency count, prioritizing static colors, then vertical/horizontal lines along the edge of the fixed component (preferring the direction that matches the small component's shape, e.g., taller than wide for vertical), and favoring the "bottom" or "right" side based on average positions; if no fit, fall back to horizontal banners placed sequentially from the top of the grid at rounded average columns.
 * Special handling for single-cell components with no adjacent fixed areas: they are placed at a "bottom" row derived from prior placements for that color.
 * Grids have variable sizes (e.g., 12x12 for train1, 10x10 for train2, 12x12 for train3/test), with 0 as empty; output must exactly match expected, including preserving fixed parts and filling empties correctly.
 * Subtlety: Attachments must fit exactly in empty space without overlap, and bounds-checked (e.g., can't go outside grid); if partial fit, it's invalid.
 * Another subtlety: When grouping small components by target fixed color, union their positions for shape calculation, but place them as a single block— this assumes they form a cohesive banner, but may fail if they are disconnected.
 * Banner placement starts from row 0 and stacks downward, but only after attachment attempts; uses trial-and-error offsets around average column, which could place them suboptimally.
 * Easy to miss: Color 0 is ignored entirely; multiple small components of the same color may be grouped or placed separately; "bottom" for placement is tracked per color as the max row/col used so far, but for singles it's used as the placement row.
 * Relocation removes original positions by setting to 0; no merging of colors—small components keep their color when attached.
 * Potential overcomplication: The code tries vertical then horizontal (or vice versa based on shape), preferred side first, but this heuristic fails when the expected requires a specific orientation or non-preferred side.

                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:

(This finds 4-connected components per color, essential for identifying movable vs fixed parts.)

def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)

def compute_average_row(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in pos) / n

def compute_average_col(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in pos) / n
```
(These are useful for bounding boxes, centroids, and deciding attachment sides/directions; min_max helps check edge alignment, averages guide "preferred" placement.)

(Combines positions from multiple components of the same color for shape analysis—helpful but assumes they should be treated as one block, which may not always hold.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, but it fails all three training examples despite correctly identifying components and attempting relocations.
 * Train 1: Generated moves the 6 in row2 col0 correctly but places a stray 6 in row3 col7-8 (expected empty there); fails to place two 7s in row10 cols1-2 (instead places one 7 in row10 col2 and leaves others empty/misplaced); 3s in row11 are partially wrong (generated has 3s starting col6, expected from col3). What worked: Preserves most of the 4s and top 6/4 structure; removes small 7 component correctly. What didn't: Misplaces 7s (possibly due to banner logic stacking them wrong or failing attachment to 3s); ignores or mishandles a small 7 group near bottom.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 9s scattered and adds extra 9s in row6 cols2/5 (expected has 9s consolidated vertically in cols2 rows0-2 and row2 col7); places 6s mostly correct but adds extras; 3s are deconstructed wrong (expected keeps bottom 3s intact, removes middle ones). What worked: Some 6 placements in rows4-5 cols6/8; identifies small 3 and 9 components. What didn't: Fails to merge/attach 9s into a vertical banner on left; doesn't remove interior 3s properly (e.g., row6 col2/4 should be empty); banner logic places 9s horizontally instead of vertically.
 * Train 3: Generated places 7s scattered in row7 cols3-6 and row0 col5 (expected has vertical 7s in col5 rows0-2); 6s are mostly correct but adds extras in row0 col7 and row7 col8. What worked: Preserves the main 6 structure in rows4-10 cols2/4/8; identifies border-touching 6s as fixed. What didn't: Misattaches small 7s (expected attaches to top as vertical banner); places rogue 6 in top row; fails to remove/relocate interior small components cleanly.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (correctly finds fixed vs small), but relocation heuristics fail—e.g., wrong orientation (vertical vs horizontal), incorrect side preference (e.g., attaches to wrong edge of fixed component), or falls back to banners too early/places them offset; special singles logic doesn't trigger properly; unioning small groups assumes cohesion that isn't always present; no handling for color-specific rules beyond static 3/4.
 * The banner placement (sequential from top, trial offsets) is unhelpful/broken for cases needing bottom or side placement (e.g., train1 7s at bottom); it overlaps or misaligns frequently.
 * Fixed_pos tracking is helpful but incomplete—doesn't account for newly placed attachments updating fixed areas dynamically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the full program() is overly complex and heuristic-driven, leading to inconsistent fits; simplify attachment trials or add more constraints (e.g., match exact expected shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it preserves some fixed parts (e.g., 2s in row3 cols1-5, 4s in row3 cols6-8, 8s in row0 cols9-11, 7s in row9 col5-6, 2s in row11 cols8/10) but leaves many small components (e.g., scattered 9s in rows7-11 cols1/2/4/5) in their original positions instead of relocating them; adds no new attachments or banners, resulting in a mostly unchanged grid with empties unfilled (e.g., expected likely consolidates 9s into a vertical or attached group near the 7s or bottom, moves the single 9 in row6 col3, and places small 2 in row11 col10 attached to the 8s or as banner). This suggests the attachment logic failed entirely for the 9s (no adjacent fixed for many), and banner/special single placement didn't trigger, leaving the grid fragmented; it doesn't match any plausible "reorganized" state, as small interior 9s should be moved to borders or stacked.

[2025-10-01 15:23:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small, non-border-touching connected components ("blobs") of dynamic colors (non-3/4) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned either by attaching them linearly (horizontally or vertically, based on their original shape's aspect ratio) to the nearest or best-matching static anchor components (colors 3 or 4), or as vertical "banners" from the top edge if no suitable anchor exists. The goal is to preserve the overall visual structure while reorganizing these small dynamic blobs into clean, attached lines without overlaps or border violations, often resulting in more compact or symmetric forms in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are defined using 4-way (orthogonal) connectivity for discovery, but 8-way (including diagonals) is used for adjacency checks to anchors—ensure consistency to avoid missing touches.
 * Only "small" components qualify for moving: defined as <8 cells and not touching any grid border (rows 0/last or cols 0/last); larger or border-touching blobs stay in place unchanged.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) act as primary anchors; dynamic colors (e.g., 2,6,7,8,9) are the ones to move—prioritize attaching to statics over other dynamics, and prefer lower-numbered or static anchors when multiple options exist based on adjacency count.
 * Placement logic: After removal, group small comps by their best anchor (most adjacent cells to it). Re-place as a single linear block matching the original component's span (row_span for vertical, col_span for horizontal). Prefer vertical placement if anchor is taller than wide (or vice versa for horizontal), attaching to the "opposite" side relative to the small comp's average position (e.g., if small comp was left of anchor avg, attach right). If blocked, clamp to grid edges or partially place vertically from top/bottom, but stop at obstacles—never overlap existing cells.
 * For no anchor (adjacency count 0), place as a vertical banner: start from top row (r=0) in the rounded average column of the original positions, filling downward until the full length is placed or grid ends; try nearby columns if blocked.
 * Subtleties: Averages (row/col) guide side preference and positioning—use them to select attachment rows/cols from the anchor's extent. Preserve original shape aspect (e.g., if original span is wider, try horizontal first). Multiple small comps sharing an anchor should be merged into one linear placement. Do not move statics or large/border blobs. Grid is copied deeply to avoid mutating originals during processing. Process dynamic colors in sorted order to handle priorities. Easy to miss: Partial placement only for vertical (clamping at top/bottom), not horizontal; banners always vertical from top, not bottom. Ensure no self-overlap after removal. Outputs must exactly match expected cell-by-cell, including zeros.

These functions are solid for component extraction, sizing, bordering, and averaging—core to identifying and characterizing movable blobs. Use them as building blocks.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid reusing):**
```python
def compute_best_anchor(pos_s: List[Tuple[int, int]], g: List[List[int]], color_s: int, rows: int, cols: int, static_colors: Set[int]) -> int:
    # Broken: Sorts by static preference then color number, but doesn't handle ties well or prefer closest anchor; leads to wrong anchor selection in multi-anchor cases.

def place_horizontal(...):  # Partially broken: Doesn't clamp or partial-place if blocked, causing full failures; side selection based on avgs is good but row selection too rigid (uses sorted anchor rows but defaults poorly).

def place_vertical(...):  # Broken for 'above' side: Partial placement stops at blocks but doesn't guarantee full length if clamped; 'below' assumes full free space without partial option, missing expected partial fills.

def place_banner(...):  # Unhelpful as-is: Tries columns in order from avg_c but doesn't prioritize free space or handle horizontal spans; always vertical, but ignores original shape for banners.
```
These placement functions fail on edge cases like partial blocks, wrong side attachments, and banner positioning, leading to scattered or misplaced cells.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core placement logic is flawed despite good component detection.
 * Train 1: Successfully detected and removed small 6 and 7 comps (cleared originals), but placed 7 as a misplaced horizontal at top (row 0, cols 7-?) instead of vertical attachment below 3's at bottom (expected row 10, cols 1-2); 6's partially attached wrong to 4's (extra 6 at row 2 col 6-7, missing expected row 3 col 7-8 and row 10? wait, expected has 6's integrated differently—unknown why shapes don't match exactly, possibly due to wrong anchor or span calc).
 * Train 2: Detected small 9 and 6 comps but failed grouping/merging; 9's scattered horizontally/vertically (e.g., row 0 col 2, row 4 col 5) instead of stacked vertical banner on left (expected rows 0-2 col 2, row 2 col 7); 6's placed singly (row 0 col 7, row 4 col 6-7? partial) instead of horizontal attachments to 3's (expected row 4 col 7, row 5 col 6-7,8? etc., forming L-shape—mismatch in linearity).
 * Train 3: Removed small 7 and 6 but placed 7 as horizontal banner at bottom (row 5 cols 8-11) instead of vertical from top attached to nothing? (expected vertical col 5 rows 0-2 for 7? wait, expected has 7 vertical col 5 rows 0-2, and 6 reformed into snake across bottom); 6 ignored or not reattached properly (stays scattered, missing expected long horizontal/vertical extensions).
 * Component finding and removal work well (empties small non-border blobs correctly), but anchor selection often picks wrong (e.g., no anchor when one exists) or places on wrong side/orientation; merging multiple small comps into one linear block fails (treats separately?).
 * Banner fallback triggers too often and positions wrong (e.g., wrong column, horizontal instead of vertical).
 * No deep issues with grid copying or color sorting, but vertical partial placement is inconsistent (works sometimes but not for 'above').

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar flaws to training failures. Small comps like 9's (original scattered in rows 8-11) are partially removed but re-placed scattered (e.g., row 0 col 3? new, row 8 col 1, row 9 col 1+4, row 10 col 1+4, row 11 col 1+4) instead of likely a vertical banner from top in avg col ~4 or attached linearly to nearby static? (no 3/4 visible, so banner expected, but not consolidated vertical in one col); 2's (original row 3 cols 1-5, border-touching? wait, row 3 col1 touches left border, so shouldn't move—but generated moves to row 10 col 11-12? wrong, as border comps stay); 7's (row 11 col 2? small) placed at row 7 cols 0-1 (horizontal, bottom-left) instead of vertical banner or attachment; 8's partial (row 10 col 6-7, row 11 col 9) not linearized or attached (expected probably vertical from top in col ~7-9). 4's and other statics untouched (good), but overall grid has misplaced dynamics not forming clean lines—e.g., no attachment to 4 in row 3, and extras like row 0 col 8=2, col9=8 misplaced. This breaks rules: border-touching 2 shouldn't move; banners should be vertical top-down in single col; no partial scatters.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (represented by numbers) where small, non-border-touching connected groups of cells (size <8) are relocated or "absorbed" by attaching them to the edges of larger, static, or border-touching components (colors 3 and 4 are explicitly static), or placed as vertical/horizontal "banners" in empty space if no attachment is possible; the goal is to produce a transformed grid that matches an expected layout, likely simulating growth, merging, or reorganization rules.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) for identification, but 8-connected (including diagonals) is used for adjacency checks when deciding attachments, which could lead to overcounting neighbors if not careful.
 * Static colors (3,4) and large components (>=8 cells) or those touching the grid border are "fixed" and cannot be moved; small components (1-7 cells, interior only) are candidates for relocation.
 * Relocation prefers attachment to the nearest fixed component based on adjacency count, prioritizing static colors, then vertical/horizontal lines along the edge of the fixed component (preferring the direction that matches the small component's shape, e.g., taller than wide for vertical), and favoring the "bottom" or "right" side based on average positions; if no fit, fall back to horizontal banners placed sequentially from the top of the grid at rounded average columns.
 * Special handling for single-cell components with no adjacent fixed areas: they are placed at a "bottom" row derived from prior placements for that color.
 * Grids have variable sizes (e.g., 12x12 for train1, 10x10 for train2, 12x12 for train3/test), with 0 as empty; output must exactly match expected, including preserving fixed parts and filling empties correctly.
 * Subtlety: Attachments must fit exactly in empty space without overlap, and bounds-checked (e.g., can't go outside grid); if partial fit, it's invalid.
 * Another subtlety: When grouping small components by target fixed color, union their positions for shape calculation, but place them as a single block— this assumes they form a cohesive banner, but may fail if they are disconnected.
 * Banner placement starts from row 0 and stacks downward, but only after attachment attempts; uses trial-and-error offsets around average column, which could place them suboptimally.
 * Easy to miss: Color 0 is ignored entirely; multiple small components of the same color may be grouped or placed separately; "bottom" for placement is tracked per color as the max row/col used so far, but for singles it's used as the placement row.
 * Relocation removes original positions by setting to 0; no merging of colors—small components keep their color when attached.
 * Potential overcomplication: The code tries vertical then horizontal (or vice versa based on shape), preferred side first, but this heuristic fails when the expected requires a specific orientation or non-preferred side.

(These are useful for bounding boxes, centroids, and deciding attachment sides/directions; min_max helps check edge alignment, averages guide "preferred" placement.)

    return union
```
(Combines positions from multiple components of the same color for shape analysis—helpful but assumes they should be treated as one block, which may not always hold.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt detailed, but it fails all three training examples despite correctly identifying components and attempting relocations.
 * Train 1: Generated moves the 6 in row2 col0 correctly but places a stray 6 in row3 col7-8 (expected empty there); fails to place two 7s in row10 cols1-2 (instead places one 7 in row10 col2 and leaves others empty/misplaced); 3s in row11 are partially wrong (generated has 3s starting col6, expected from col3). What worked: Preserves most of the 4s and top 6/4 structure; removes small 7 component correctly. What didn't: Misplaces 7s (possibly due to banner logic stacking them wrong or failing attachment to 3s); ignores or mishandles a small 7 group near bottom.
 * Train 2: Generated leaves 9s scattered and adds extra 9s in row6 cols2/5 (expected has 9s consolidated vertically in cols2 rows0-2 and row2 col7); places 6s mostly correct but adds extras; 3s are deconstructed wrong (expected keeps bottom 3s intact, removes middle ones). What worked: Some 6 placements in rows4-5 cols6/8; identifies small 3 and 9 components. What didn't: Fails to merge/attach 9s into a vertical banner on left; doesn't remove interior 3s properly (e.g., row6 col2/4 should be empty); banner logic places 9s horizontally instead of vertically.
 * Train 3: Generated places 7s scattered in row7 cols3-6 and row0 col5 (expected has vertical 7s in col5 rows0-2); 6s are mostly correct but adds extras in row0 col7 and row7 col8. What worked: Preserves the main 6 structure in rows4-10 cols2/4/8; identifies border-touching 6s as fixed. What didn't: Misattaches small 7s (expected attaches to top as vertical banner); places rogue 6 in top row; fails to remove/relocate interior small components cleanly.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (correctly finds fixed vs small), but relocation heuristics fail—e.g., wrong orientation (vertical vs horizontal), incorrect side preference (e.g., attaches to wrong edge of fixed component), or falls back to banners too early/places them offset; special singles logic doesn't trigger properly; unioning small groups assumes cohesion that isn't always present; no handling for color-specific rules beyond static 3/4.
 * The banner placement (sequential from top, trial offsets) is unhelpful/broken for cases needing bottom or side placement (e.g., train1 7s at bottom); it overlaps or misaligns frequently.
 * Fixed_pos tracking is helpful but incomplete—doesn't account for newly placed attachments updating fixed areas dynamically.
 * No unhelpful functions per se, but the full program() is overly complex and heuristic-driven, leading to inconsistent fits; simplify attachment trials or add more constraints (e.g., match exact expected shapes).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it preserves some fixed parts (e.g., 2s in row3 cols1-5, 4s in row3 cols6-8, 8s in row0 cols9-11, 7s in row9 col5-6, 2s in row11 cols8/10) but leaves many small components (e.g., scattered 9s in rows7-11 cols1/2/4/5) in their original positions instead of relocating them; adds no new attachments or banners, resulting in a mostly unchanged grid with empties unfilled (e.g., expected likely consolidates 9s into a vertical or attached group near the 7s or bottom, moves the single 9 in row6 col3, and places small 2 in row11 col10 attached to the 8s or as banner). This suggests the attachment logic failed entirely for the 9s (no adjacent fixed for many), and banner/special single placement didn't trigger, leaving the grid fragmented; it doesn't match any plausible "reorganized" state, as small interior 9s should be moved to borders or stacked.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected "island" components (groups of same-color cells) not touching the border must be identified, detached, and reattached to adjacent larger components of different colors, following specific placement rules to form complete or corrected shapes without overlaps or border touches for small parts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined as connected groups (4-way connectivity) of fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; larger components can touch borders and are not moved.
 * Union adjacent small components of the same color using 8-way connectivity before treating them as a single unit for attachment.
 * Attachment is based on adjacency (8-way) to non-small cells: attach each small union group to the "best" (most adjacent) large component of a different color.
 * After removal, placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the side of the large component (left or right based on average column position) in the row closest to the small component's average row position, only if it fits without overlap or out-of-bounds; fallback to vertical stacking from the top in the rounded average column of the small component if horizontal is blocked.
 * Shapes must preserve the relative structure of the small component (e.g., not just any placement, but matching width/height for horizontal/vertical decisions based on unique rows/cols in the small group).
 * Subtlety: Placement must avoid occupied cells in the new grid (after removals), and vertical fallback may not fill the exact unique rows if blocked, potentially leaving partial placements.
 * Border-touching small components are ignored entirely (not moved).
 * Multiple small groups can attach to the same large component, but unions are per color and handled separately.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relationships intuitive, but rounding and clamping to grid bounds can cause shifts.
 * Easy to miss: Overcounting adjacencies if small positions overlap during unioning; ensuring no self-attachment (small to small); handling cases where large component has no extreme positions for row selection; vertical placement starts from top but skips occupied cells, which may fragment the shape.
 * Components of the same color are not merged across larges; each small attaches independently to its best large.
 * Grid is modified in-place copy, with removals before all placements to avoid self-overlap.

These functions are core for component extraction and are helpful; the union-find logic in the main program (using parent/find/union) is also useful for merging adjacent small components of the same color.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly identifies small components (<8, no border) and unions same-color adjacent ones (8-way), which aligns with puzzle rules for handling disconnected islands.
 * What worked: Component detection via DFS/stack is accurate; adjacency counting for "best" large attachment is logical; removal before placement prevents self-overlap; average positions guide spatial attachment.
 * What didn't work: Placement logic fails in all training examples—horizontal placement often chooses wrong row/side or gets blocked incorrectly, leading to vertical fallbacks that don't match expected positions/shapes; e.g., in Train 1, small 6's and 3's are placed high up instead of integrating into 4's and lower areas; vertical stacking starts too high or in wrong columns.
 * Train 1 differences: Generated keeps some 6's and 3's in original positions (e.g., rows 0-1 cols 2/5) and places nothing correctly for 4's/6's/7's/3's; expected moves 4's to form a connected shape with 6's inserted, extends 3's downward/left with 7's attached low—generated ignores some attachments and misplaces vertically (e.g., 3's at bottom row 11 instead of rows 7-11).
 * Train 2 differences: Generated places 9's and 3's stacked vertically in cols 2-3 but keeps extras (e.g., row 5 col 7 has 9 misplaced); expected scatters 9's and 3's more horizontally/vertically with gaps filled differently (e.g., 9 at row 2 col 7, 3's in col 4 downward)—generated over-unions or wrong adjacencies, leading to partial overlaps or missed rotations.
 * Train 3 differences: Generated leaves 6's mostly intact but inserts 7's partially into gaps (e.g., row 7 cols 3-6); expected extends 7's vertically on left (rows 0-2 col 5) and simplifies 6's—generated fails to attach small 7's to the correct side/large and uses wrong fallback, causing fragmented 7's and untouched small 6's.
 * build_groups function (earlier version) is unhelpful/broken as it doesn't handle unioned groups properly and double-counts adjacencies—avoid reusing without the union-find modifications.
 * get_union_positions is helpful for merging positions but redundant if union-find is used well.
 * Overall, attachment detection works partially (some smalls are moved), but placement heuristics (horizontal preference, row selection by closest extreme, vertical from top) are too rigid and don't account for shape mirroring, gap-filling, or large component's min/max rows for vertical.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it leaves many original small components (e.g., 9's in rows 0-2 col 3 and rows 8-11 cols 1/4, 7 in row 2 col 3 and row 11 col 2, 2's scattered) partially moved or untouched, with misplaced 8's and 2's (e.g., 2's in row 2 cols 5-9 but not extended properly, 8's in col 10 rows 0-2/11). Expected likely involves attaching small 9's/7's/2's/8's to larges like 4's or borders, forming connected vertical/horizontal extensions (e.g., 9's stacking left, 2's filling row 3-4 gaps, 7's low attachment), but generated fragments shapes (e.g., isolated 2 in row 10 col 7) and ignores some adjacencies (e.g., 4's in row 3 cols 6-8 not extended). This suggests the horizontal placement blocks too often, forcing bad verticals, and average col/row calculations shift positions inaccurately for irregular shapes—test case highlights need for better gap detection in larges before placement.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) by detecting connected components (blobs) using 8-connectivity, identifying "small" blobs (size <6 that don't touch the border) as temporary or movable elements, removing them from their original positions, and then re-placing them either by attaching them to the edges of adjacent "large" blobs (size >=6 or border-touching) in a way that extends the shape horizontally or vertically, or by relocating unattached small blobs into vertical "banner" strips at the top of the grid, clustered by approximate column position. The goal is to produce a cleaned or reorganized grid where small blobs are logically integrated without overlapping existing cells, preserving the overall structure of large blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so blobs can be irregular shapes; use flood-fill or stack-based traversal to find them accurately.
 * Small blobs are strictly defined as size <6 AND not touching any border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); border-touching or large blobs stay fixed and cannot be moved.
 * When attaching small blobs to large ones, prioritize the large blob with the most adjacent cells (at least 1 adjacency via 8-neighbors), but only if the large blob's max size >= small blob's size; attachment must fit without overlap, preferring horizontal extension to the left/right edge of the large blob (aligned by average row) or vertical extension to the top/bottom edge (aligned by average column), using the extreme edge closest to the small blob's average position.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., out of bounds or overlap), fall back to banner placement: cluster small blobs of the same color by average column (group if within ~3 units), treat each cluster as a vertical strip of height equal to its row span, place clusters sequentially from the top in sorted color order, aligning each to its rounded average column, and ensuring no overlap by checking empty cells; use the max height of clusters in a color group to align them horizontally in the banner block.
 * Preserve all original large blobs unchanged; only modify by adding attached small blobs to empty cells adjacent to them.
 * Grids may have multiple components per color; treat them separately but union positions when computing spans/averages for attachment or banners.
 * Empty cells (0) must remain available for placement; no overwriting of any non-zero cells.
 * Subtle: Attachments should mimic "growing" the large blob's shape (e.g., extending protrusions), not arbitrary placement; in examples, small blobs like vertical lines or L-shapes attach to sides, forming compound shapes. Banners are always at the top (starting from row 0 downward), and if multiple colors, place in sorted color order without gaps between banner blocks.
 * Edge cases: Zero-size or empty grids return unchanged; single-cell small blobs still need attachment if possible; if no large blob for attachment, all go to banners; banners don't touch borders in a way that reclassifies them as large.
 * Colors are positive integers; sort fallback colors numerically for banner order.
 * Observed in examples: Rotations or flips aren't needed; placements must exactly match expected shapes, including internal gaps (e.g., non-solid rectangles).

    seen = set()
    union = []

            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This is helpful for merging multiple components of the same color into a single position set for span/average calculations in banners or attachments; prevents double-counting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects and removes small components (<6 size, no border touch), as evidenced by cleared positions in all generated outputs matching where small blobs were in inputs (inferred from differences).
 * Component extraction via find_components works well, grouping by color and handling multiples per color.
 * Attachment logic partially works: it identifies adjacent large colors and attempts edge extensions (e.g., in Train1, some 4's and 6's are placed near each other), but fails on exact positioning—e.g., in Train1, generated places 6's horizontally at top-left of 4's instead of vertically attaching to the right side as in expected, resulting in [6,6,4,4,...] in row1 vs. expected [0,0,4,4,...] in row1 and 6's lower/right.
 * Banner placement has issues: in Train1, 7's are placed at bottom-right [...,7,7] in row7 but expected attaches them to bottom of 3's banner; generated banner for 3's is scattered vertically instead of a solid block with 7's integrated low. In Train2, no banners used correctly—small 9's and 6's are placed scattered instead of vertical banners. In Train3, 7's are wrongly placed as a horizontal block in middle row7 instead of vertical left-side attachment/extension.
 * Fallback clustering by avg col (~3 unit threshold) is a good idea but buggy: in Train1, 3's comps aren't clustered into one banner block, leading to partial vertical lines; current_top advances incorrectly, overlapping or misaligning.
 * Horizontal/vertical attachment prefers wrong direction/orientation: in Train2, generated places 6's high-right [...,6,0,0] in rows1-3 but expected attaches low-right to 3's shape; in Train3, vertical 7's should extend left of 6's but generated embeds them inside.
 * Adjacency counting for best large blob is correct (e.g., Train1 small 6 adj to 4), but condition large_max_size >= small_size skips valid attachments sometimes (unknown if this caused skips, but placements don't match).
 * No overwriting occurs (good), but placements go out-of-bounds or to non-empty cells implicitly, as fits are checked but alternatives (e.g., other edges) aren't tried exhaustively.
 * In all trains, large blobs (e.g., 4 in Train1, 3 in Train2, 6 in Train3) remain intact and unchanged, which matches expectations.
 * Train1 mismatches: generated has extra 6's in row1-2 left, 4's shifted wrong, 7's detached at row7 right vs. expected 6's right-attached to 4's in row3, 7's bottom-attached to 3's in row10.
 * Train2 mismatches: generated scatters 9's and 6's vertically left/middle without attachment (e.g., 9's in col2 rows0-2, 6's col7 rows0-3) vs. expected 9's vertical col7 rows0-2+3, 6's attached right/low to 3's in rows4-5 cols6-8.
 * Train3 mismatches: generated places 7's as block row7 cols3-6 inside 6's area vs. expected 7's as full vertical strip col5 rows0-2 (extending above 6's? Wait, expected shows col5 rows0-2 as 7's, but input likely has 6's starting row3; unknown why not attached to side, but generated invades large 6's space).
 * The get_union_positions is helpful but underused—attachments treat single comps, not unioning multiples for better fitting.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the attachment's extreme edge selection (min/max col/row) is too rigid—should try all possible edges or rotations if needed (though examples don't rotate).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it scatters 2's irregularly (e.g., horizontal in row2 cols6-10, single in row0 col7 and row3 col10, vertical in row4 cols5-9), which seems like failed attachments rather than coherent extensions (e.g., probably small 2's blobs not properly attached to a large 2's component in col7 row0?); 4's are intact in row2 cols2-4 but 2's overlap nearby without merging shape. 9's are placed as a broken L-shape rows7-10 cols1-4+0/2, with gaps, vs. likely needing vertical attachment to a large 9. 7's are a small block row9 col2-3, possibly unattached. 8's are vertical-ish on right rows7-11 col9-11 but jagged (e.g., row11 col8-9-11), suggesting banner misplacement instead of side attachment. Overall, it lacks the clean extensions/banners seen in expectations—banners should be top-blocked, not mid/bottom scattered; attachments should form solid protrusions, not isolated pieces. This indicates the program handles detection but fails precise fitting/prioritization, especially for multi-comp colors or complex shapes; to fix test, improve edge-alignment to try multiple positions per direction and ensure banners start strictly at row0 without skipping.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components (likely "floating" or temporary objects) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned according to rules like attaching them to larger "static" structures (colors 3 and 4) or placing them as vertical banners in optimal columns, simulating gravity, attachment, or alignment in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components using 8-directional neighborhood connectivity for same-color cells.
 * Distinguish "static" large or border-touching components (e.g., colors 3 and 4 are treated as anchors; components touching borders or >=8 cells are static and not moved).
 * Remove small dynamic components (<8 cells, not touching borders) entirely from the grid.
 * For re-placement: Prioritize attaching linear (horizontal span equals size) components to the nearest static color based on adjacency counts, placing them horizontally adjacent to the static structure's edge (left or right side based on average column position), at the row closest to the dynamic component's average row.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., blocked cells or non-linear shape), treat as "banners": Cluster by average column position (group if within <3 columns), compute row span, place vertically in the highest possible row band (aligned to max height of all banners), in a rounded average column, scanning ±5 columns for free space.
 * Subtleties: Attachments must check for blocking (non-zero cells in target positions); unions of multiple components per color/group when attaching; banners align to a global max height starting from top; prefer higher adjacency count for anchor choice, tie-break by lower color ID; linear check is strictly size == col_span (ignores row span, assumes horizontal linearity); empty or zero-size components return neutral bounds/averages; deep copy grid to avoid modifying original during processing.
 * Edge cases: Components with no adjacency default to banners; overlapping unions in attachments; vertical placements must fit within rows and not overlap existing cells; border-touching prevents movement even if small; colors beyond 3/4 are dynamic.
 * Potential misses: Directionality of attachment (e.g., always to the "outer" side?); shape preservation (current code flattens to lines or singles, may lose original form); gravity-like falling if no attachment; clustering threshold (3.0 units) may group unrelated banners; placement deltas (±5) might overshoot or miss optimal spots; no rotation or reshaping of components.

 * In Training 2, removal works (9's and 6's cleared), but re-placement errs: Generated places vertical 9's on left cols0-1 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col3, 6 at row2 col2 (scattered), while expected attaches 9's as vertical on col2 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col7, 6's horizontally attached to 3's at rows4-5 cols6-8/9—generated treats 9's as attachable but picks wrong anchor/side, and 6's not attached properly (possibly banner-clustered wrong).
 * In Training 3, identifies 7 (vertical size=3<8, non-border) and 6 (large blob, static), removes 7 but places it vertically on left border cols0 rows0-2, while expected places it vertically on col5 rows0-2 attached right of where 7 was? (overlaps original position? No, expected shifts 7 right to col5, but 6 remains—wait, generated keeps 6 intact but misplaces 7 on wrong side; linearity check fails as col_span=1==size, but attachment to 6 (not static 3/4) ignored since only 3/4 are anchors.
 * Banner clustering sorts by avg col and groups if <3 apart, places vertically at max_h - span, scanning ±5 cols, but in Train1, 7's become banner but placed right (col10-11) instead of left-attached to 3's; in Train2, 6's/9's clustered wrong leading to left placements vs expected right/top.
 * Overall, worked: Component finding, removal, unioning, spans/averages, border checks. Didn't work: Anchor limited to 3/4 (Train3 needs attachment to 6?); linearity assumes horizontal only (verticals like 6/7/9 fail attachment); side choice (avg_c_s < avg_c_a picks left, but often needs right); placement ignores original shape (flattens to line/single col for banners); no fallback to borders or gravity; blocked checks prevent some but default to wrong banner spots; in Train1, can_place for 6 ignores vertical nature.
 * Function `get_anchor_positions` is helpful for static pos but limited to specific colors. The main `program` integrates all but has flawed decision tree (e.g., dynamic_small_comps append comp, but later union only for attachments).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It retains some original 2's (e.g., vertical at col4 rows0-1, horizontal at row2 cols5-9, scattered at row3 col10 and row4 cols5-9) but adds/modifies others (e.g., 2 at row3 col4? No, output shows partial 2's retained/repurposed, but introduces no clear attachments—4's at row3 cols6-8 untouched (static?), 9's/7/8 at bottom scattered/retained without removal, no banners placed; expected likely removes small 2's (the floating horizontal/vertical groups <8, non-border), attaches 2's to 4's (right side?), and handles bottom 7/8/9 as banners or attachments (e.g., 7 horizontal at row9 cols2-3 attached down from 9's? 8's vertical on right, 9's L-shape). Differences: No removal of small 2's (e.g., row2 cols5-9 should move), bottom components not repositioned (7/8/9/2 scattered as-is vs likely vertical banners in cols rounded to avg, e.g., 8's at col9-10 vertical, 7 at col2-3); 4's static ok, but no 2 attachment (e.g., expected 2's horizontal right of 4's at row3 cols9-?); overall, output looks like partial retention with minimal changes, missing core removal/replacement—does not make sense as it ignores dynamic rules for 2/7/8/9.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

                seen.add(tp)

(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

```
(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where connected components of the same color are identified and classified as static/large (if color 3 or 4, size >=8, or touching the border) or small/movable (otherwise). Small components are removed and then repositioned either by attaching them as horizontal or vertical banners to the edges of adjacent large components (preferring orientation based on their shape) or, if unplaced, as vertical banners sorted by average column position at the top of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood fill to find connected groups.
 * Static/large components stay in place; small ones are erased first, then placed without overlapping anything.
 * For attachment: Prefer horizontal placement if the small component spans more columns than rows (or equal, default to horizontal); vertical otherwise. Align to the edge of the large component (left/right or top/bottom) based on average positions, using candidate rows/columns from the anchor's edge, sorted by proximity to the small's average.
 * For vertical attachment, if the preferred side (above/below based on averages) fails due to space or overlap, try the opposite side.
 * Unplaced smalls form "banner groups" unioned by best anchor color; if no anchor, treat as free-floating. Place free or unattachable groups as vertical banners at the top, starting from a height based on the max length of such groups, centered roughly on their average column (with delta trials for fitting).
 * Subtlety: Banners must fit exactly in free space (all zeros) without partial overlaps; length is based on distinct rows/cols in the union. Sorting banners by average column ensures left-to-right order.
 * Edge cases: Empty components return defaults (e.g., avg 0); ensure bounds checking for placements. Groups with same anchor and color are unioned before placement.
 * When placing banners at top, the start row is max_h - length, but max_h is max distinct rows of banners—ensures they stack without overlap, but may clip if too tall (though grids seem to fit).
 * Adjacency for anchoring counts neighboring large cells (8-dir) to choose best anchor by max touches; only anchor if large and >0 touches.
 * Potential miss: In vertical placement fallback, the code has a nested loop that breaks correctly only if placed, but may skip some candidates if outer loop breaks prematurely.
 * All placements use the original small color; no color changes.

```
(These are helpful for determining placement sides (e.g., avg positions for left/right) and bounds for edge alignment; min/max useful for edge refs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles component extraction and classification (static if color 3/4, size >=8, or border-touching; smalls otherwise), as evidenced by training 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * Training 1 correct: All smalls placed properly, likely attached or as banners matching expected.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places two 9s horizontally at top-left (rows 0-2, cols 2-2 but duplicated), and 6s incorrectly (one at row2 col7, others scattered at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8) instead of expected (9s vertical at col2 rows0-2 and one at row2 col7; 6s more integrated at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8 but with an extra at row2 col7 as 9? Wait, expected has 9 at row2 col7, 6s starting row3 col7 downward rightward—mismatch in 6 placement positions and missing integration; unknown why horizontal preference failed for 9s or why 6s didn't attach vertically to 3s properly).
 * Training 3 correct: Placements matched, suggesting vertical/horizontal logic works for some shapes/anchors.
 * Attempt groups smalls by best anchor (max adjacent large color), unions them, and prefers orientation (horizontal if wider), but in training 2, this led to misplacement of 9s (treated as horizontal banner?) and 6s (partial attachment but wrong side/position).
 * Banner fallback at top sorts by avg col and trials deltas/signs for fitting, but in training 2, it placed 9s too clustered/left without proper vertical stacking, and 6s overlapped or ignored anchor.
 * The vertical placement fallback (trying opposite side) is included but buggy in training 2—code has nested loops that may not fully explore candidates, leading to unplaced 6s defaulting incorrectly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., neighbors, components) are relevant, though the main program logic needs tuning for side selection and candidate sorting.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 2s in a scattered way (e.g., top rows have 2s at col10-11 row0, col7/10 row1, dense row2 cols5-9, row3 col10, row4 cols5-9) which seems like partial re-placement of a large 2 blob, but likely incorrect as it doesn't erase and reattach smalls properly—appears to leave some original positions or fail unioning, resulting in non-contiguous banners; expected should erase small 2s/others, attach to large 4 (at row3 cols6-8?) perhaps vertically below, and place 9/7/8 as banners or attachments to borders/statics, but output has 9s/7s/8s mostly original with no clear movement (e.g., 9s at rows7-11 cols1-4/8, 7s row9-11 col2-3, 8s row7-11 col9-11)—no top banners visible, suggesting attachment logic failed for most smalls, leaving grid almost unchanged except top 2s messed up; this does not make sense as smalls like isolated 9s/7s/8 should move/attach, and 2s should form clean banners.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 15:32:02] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a colored grid where the goal is to identify and preserve "fixed" connected components (large groups, border-touching groups, or specific colors like 3 and 4) while removing and repositioning small, movable components (under 8 cells, not border-touching, and adjacent to fixed parts) by attaching them to nearby anchors or placing them in a banner-style layout to reconstruct or simplify the image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are identified using 4-directional neighbors for core grouping, but 8-directional neighbors are used for adjacency checks and sub-grouping, which could lead to over-merging if not careful.
 * Fixed positions include all cells of colors 3 and 4 (regardless of size/location), plus any other color's components that touch the grid border or have 8+ cells; this ensures structural elements stay in place.
 * Movable components are only small (under 8 cells), interior (no border touch), and must be adjacent (8-dir) to at least one fixed cell to be considered for removal/replacement—isolated small components might be ignored.
 * Repositioning prioritizes attachment to the most adjacent fixed color (anchor), preferring orientations based on the anchor's span (vertical if taller, horizontal if wider), and using averages/edges for placement; if unattached, fall back to a "banner" placement sorted by column average, stacking vertically with max length alignment.
 * Sub-groups within a color's small components are re-clustered using 8-dir connectivity after removal, allowing fragmented pieces to be treated separately.
 * Grid boundaries must be strictly respected in placement functions to avoid out-of-bounds errors; empty grid handling is included but trivial.
 * Potential subtlety: Placement tries limited candidates (e.g., top 3 edge positions) to avoid exhaustive search, but this might miss optimal spots; banner fallback assumes vertical stacking, which could fail if horizontal is needed.
 * Colors are treated per-component, but movable colors are aggregated—ensure removal doesn't affect fixed parts of the same color.
 * No rotation or complex shaping is considered; assumes straight-line (horizontal/vertical) placements only.

                components[color].append(component)

```
(These core functions for neighbor finding and component extraction via DFS are solid and reusable for identifying objects; they handle 4-connectivity correctly for components.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)

def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)

def compute_average_row(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in pos) / n

def compute_average_col(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in pos) / n

def get_row_span(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    min_r, max_r, _, _ = compute_min_max(pos)
    return max_r - min_r + 1

def get_col_span(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    _, _, min_c, max_c = compute_min_max(pos)
    return max_c - min_c + 1
```
(These utility functions for bounding boxes, spans, and averages are helpful for placement decisions and anchor alignment.)

The placement functions (try_place_horizontal, try_place_vertical, place_attached, place_banner) are conceptually useful for re-inserting components but are broken due to syntax errors and incomplete logic (e.g., hardcoded "g[0][0] wait no" in place_attached).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, but it fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 201 (likely a missing comma or incomplete expression in try_place_vertical call within place_attached, where "g[0][0] wait no, color" appears as a placeholder/comment artifact).
 * Component identification and fixed/movable classification logic seems well-structured and likely correct in intent, but untested due to execution failure.
 * Removal of movables works on paper (deepcopy and targeted zeroing), but sub-grouping and re-placement introduce complexities like 8-dir clustering that might overconnect unrelated small pieces.
 * Anchor-based attachment prefers the dominant adjacent color and aligns to edges/averages, which captures a key puzzle subtlety (attaching to similar structures), but limits candidates to top-3 positions, potentially missing placements.
 * Banner fallback sorts by avg_c and stacks vertically, which might not always fit the puzzle's visual intent (e.g., if horizontal banners are needed).
 * No successful runs, so can't confirm if it handles multi-component colors or empty grids correctly; the error prevents any validation.
 * Functions like get_fixed_positions and get_movable_colors are helpful and relevant for partitioning the grid.
 * The place_banner function assumes a fixed vertical stacking with max_length alignment, which could be unhelpful if the puzzle requires more flexible layouts (e.g., horizontal or centered without stacking).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training examples) is an execution error due to invalid syntax on line 201, so no actual grid output is generated—it's completely non-functional and does not produce any transformed grid.
 * Expected output should be a modified grid with small movable components removed from original positions and re-placed attached to fixed anchors or in a banner; since nothing runs, it doesn't match any expected puzzle solution (e.g., no simplification or reconstruction occurs).
 * The error makes the output useless; it differs from expected by not executing at all, likely because of the garbled line in place_attached (e.g., "g[0][0] wait no, color" suggests an unfinished edit, causing parse failure).
 * Without a running program, can't assess if the test input's specific layout (unknown here, but presumably has small interior components adjacent to fixed ones) would be handled correctly—assume it wouldn't due to total failure.

[2025-10-01 15:32:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components (likely "floating" or temporary objects) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned according to rules like attaching them to larger "static" structures (colors 3 and 4) or placing them as vertical banners in optimal columns, simulating gravity, attachment, or alignment in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components using 8-directional neighborhood connectivity for same-color cells.
 * Distinguish "static" large or border-touching components (e.g., colors 3 and 4 are treated as anchors; components touching borders or >=8 cells are static and not moved).
 * Remove small dynamic components (<8 cells, not touching borders) entirely from the grid.
 * For re-placement: Prioritize attaching linear (horizontal span equals size) components to the nearest static color based on adjacency counts, placing them horizontally adjacent to the static structure's edge (left or right side based on average column position), at the row closest to the dynamic component's average row.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., blocked cells or non-linear shape), treat as "banners": Cluster by average column position (group if within <3 columns), compute row span, place vertically in the highest possible row band (aligned to max height of all banners), in a rounded average column, scanning ±5 columns for free space.
 * Subtleties: Attachments must check for blocking (non-zero cells in target positions); unions of multiple components per color/group when attaching; banners align to a global max height starting from top; prefer higher adjacency count for anchor choice, tie-break by lower color ID; linear check is strictly size == col_span (ignores row span, assumes horizontal linearity); empty or zero-size components return neutral bounds/averages; deep copy grid to avoid modifying original during processing.
 * Edge cases: Components with no adjacency default to banners; overlapping unions in attachments; vertical placements must fit within rows and not overlap existing cells; border-touching prevents movement even if small; colors beyond 3/4 are dynamic.
 * Potential misses: Directionality of attachment (e.g., always to the "outer" side?); shape preservation (current code flattens to lines or singles, may lose original form); gravity-like falling if no attachment; clustering threshold (3.0 units) may group unrelated banners; placement deltas (±5) might overshoot or miss optimal spots; no rotation or reshaping of components.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small dynamic components (<8 cells, non-border-touching) while preserving static ones (3 and 4, or border-touching), using solid component extraction via DFS/stack and 8-connectivity.
 * Attachment logic partially works by counting adjacencies to static colors and unioning same-color groups, but fails in placement: In Training 1, the 6 (vertical line, size=3, col_span=1 != size so not linear) is removed but not reattached to the right of the 4 blob (expected at rows 3-4, cols 7-8 as [6,6] horizontal? Wait, expected shows single 6's at [2,0] and [3,7-8] but mismatched; generated places vertical 6's on left border rows 0-2 col0, and 7's (small L-shape?) on bottom right cols10-11 rows7-8, while expected has 6 at [2,0] (odd) and 6's at [3,7-8], 7's shifted left in row10 cols1-2 attached to 3's—unknown why 6 at [2,0] in expected, but generated ignores linearity for 6 and places wrongly on border.
 * In Training 2, removal works (9's and 6's cleared), but re-placement errs: Generated places vertical 9's on left cols0-1 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col3, 6 at row2 col2 (scattered), while expected attaches 9's as vertical on col2 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col7, 6's horizontally attached to 3's at rows4-5 cols6-8/9—generated treats 9's as attachable but picks wrong anchor/side, and 6's not attached properly (possibly banner-clustered wrong).
 * In Training 3, identifies 7 (vertical size=3<8, non-border) and 6 (large blob, static), removes 7 but places it vertically on left border cols0 rows0-2, while expected places it vertically on col5 rows0-2 attached right of where 7 was? (overlaps original position? No, expected shifts 7 right to col5, but 6 remains—wait, generated keeps 6 intact but misplaces 7 on wrong side; linearity check fails as col_span=1==size, but attachment to 6 (not static 3/4) ignored since only 3/4 are anchors.
 * Banner clustering sorts by avg col and groups if <3 apart, places vertically at max_h - span, scanning ±5 cols, but in Train1, 7's become banner but placed right (col10-11) instead of left-attached to 3's; in Train2, 6's/9's clustered wrong leading to left placements vs expected right/top.
 * Overall, worked: Component finding, removal, unioning, spans/averages, border checks. Didn't work: Anchor limited to 3/4 (Train3 needs attachment to 6?); linearity assumes horizontal only (verticals like 6/7/9 fail attachment); side choice (avg_c_s < avg_c_a picks left, but often needs right); placement ignores original shape (flattens to line/single col for banners); no fallback to borders or gravity; blocked checks prevent some but default to wrong banner spots; in Train1, can_place for 6 ignores vertical nature.
 * Function `get_anchor_positions` is helpful for static pos but limited to specific colors. The main `program` integrates all but has flawed decision tree (e.g., dynamic_small_comps append comp, but later union only for attachments).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It retains some original 2's (e.g., vertical at col4 rows0-1, horizontal at row2 cols5-9, scattered at row3 col10 and row4 cols5-9) but adds/modifies others (e.g., 2 at row3 col4? No, output shows partial 2's retained/repurposed, but introduces no clear attachments—4's at row3 cols6-8 untouched (static?), 9's/7/8 at bottom scattered/retained without removal, no banners placed; expected likely removes small 2's (the floating horizontal/vertical groups <8, non-border), attaches 2's to 4's (right side?), and handles bottom 7/8/9 as banners or attachments (e.g., 7 horizontal at row9 cols2-3 attached down from 9's? 8's vertical on right, 9's L-shape). Differences: No removal of small 2's (e.g., row2 cols5-9 should move), bottom components not repositioned (7/8/9/2 scattered as-is vs likely vertical banners in cols rounded to avg, e.g., 8's at col9-10 vertical, 7 at col2-3); 4's static ok, but no 2 attachment (e.g., expected 2's horizontal right of 4's at row3 cols9-?); overall, output looks like partial retention with minimal changes, missing core removal/replacement—does not make sense as it ignores dynamic rules for 2/7/8/9.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

```
(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where connected components of the same color are identified and classified as static/large (if color 3 or 4, size >=8, or touching the border) or small/movable (otherwise). Small components are removed and then repositioned either by attaching them as horizontal or vertical banners to the edges of adjacent large components (preferring orientation based on their shape) or, if unplaced, as vertical banners sorted by average column position at the top of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood fill to find connected groups.
 * Static/large components stay in place; small ones are erased first, then placed without overlapping anything.
 * For attachment: Prefer horizontal placement if the small component spans more columns than rows (or equal, default to horizontal); vertical otherwise. Align to the edge of the large component (left/right or top/bottom) based on average positions, using candidate rows/columns from the anchor's edge, sorted by proximity to the small's average.
 * For vertical attachment, if the preferred side (above/below based on averages) fails due to space or overlap, try the opposite side.
 * Unplaced smalls form "banner groups" unioned by best anchor color; if no anchor, treat as free-floating. Place free or unattachable groups as vertical banners at the top, starting from a height based on the max length of such groups, centered roughly on their average column (with delta trials for fitting).
 * Subtlety: Banners must fit exactly in free space (all zeros) without partial overlaps; length is based on distinct rows/cols in the union. Sorting banners by average column ensures left-to-right order.
 * Edge cases: Empty components return defaults (e.g., avg 0); ensure bounds checking for placements. Groups with same anchor and color are unioned before placement.
 * When placing banners at top, the start row is max_h - length, but max_h is max distinct rows of banners—ensures they stack without overlap, but may clip if too tall (though grids seem to fit).
 * Adjacency for anchoring counts neighboring large cells (8-dir) to choose best anchor by max touches; only anchor if large and >0 touches.
 * Potential miss: In vertical placement fallback, the code has a nested loop that breaks correctly only if placed, but may skip some candidates if outer loop breaks prematurely.
 * All placements use the original small color; no color changes.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles component extraction and classification (static if color 3/4, size >=8, or border-touching; smalls otherwise), as evidenced by training 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * Training 1 correct: All smalls placed properly, likely attached or as banners matching expected.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places two 9s horizontally at top-left (rows 0-2, cols 2-2 but duplicated), and 6s incorrectly (one at row2 col7, others scattered at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8) instead of expected (9s vertical at col2 rows0-2 and one at row2 col7; 6s more integrated at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8 but with an extra at row2 col7 as 9? Wait, expected has 9 at row2 col7, 6s starting row3 col7 downward rightward—mismatch in 6 placement positions and missing integration; unknown why horizontal preference failed for 9s or why 6s didn't attach vertically to 3s properly).
 * Training 3 correct: Placements matched, suggesting vertical/horizontal logic works for some shapes/anchors.
 * Attempt groups smalls by best anchor (max adjacent large color), unions them, and prefers orientation (horizontal if wider), but in training 2, this led to misplacement of 9s (treated as horizontal banner?) and 6s (partial attachment but wrong side/position).
 * Banner fallback at top sorts by avg col and trials deltas/signs for fitting, but in training 2, it placed 9s too clustered/left without proper vertical stacking, and 6s overlapped or ignored anchor.
 * The vertical placement fallback (trying opposite side) is included but buggy in training 2—code has nested loops that may not fully explore candidates, leading to unplaced 6s defaulting incorrectly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., neighbors, components) are relevant, though the main program logic needs tuning for side selection and candidate sorting.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 2s in a scattered way (e.g., top rows have 2s at col10-11 row0, col7/10 row1, dense row2 cols5-9, row3 col10, row4 cols5-9) which seems like partial re-placement of a large 2 blob, but likely incorrect as it doesn't erase and reattach smalls properly—appears to leave some original positions or fail unioning, resulting in non-contiguous banners; expected should erase small 2s/others, attach to large 4 (at row3 cols6-8?) perhaps vertically below, and place 9/7/8 as banners or attachments to borders/statics, but output has 9s/7s/8s mostly original with no clear movement (e.g., 9s at rows7-11 cols1-4/8, 7s row9-11 col2-3, 8s row7-11 col9-11)—no top banners visible, suggesting attachment logic failed for most smalls, leaving grid almost unchanged except top 2s messed up; this does not make sense as smalls like isolated 9s/7s/8 should move/attach, and 2s should form clean banners.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import math

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:38:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small, enclosed components (fewer than 8 cells, not touching the border) represent "floating" or detached parts that need to be removed from their current positions and reattached horizontally to the nearest adjacent large component (size >=8 or border-touching) based on maximum adjacency, or if unattached, placed as vertical "banners" at the bottom of the grid, sorted by their average column position and aligned to the bottom with partial placement if needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are identified using 8-connected neighborhood (including diagonals), so adjacency considers all eight directions.
 * Small components are strictly those with size <8 that do not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); larger or border-touching ones are considered "large" and anchors for attachment.
 * When grouping small components, count adjacencies only to non-small cells of large components; choose the anchor color with the maximum adjacency count; if tied or zero, they become unattached banners.
 * Horizontal attachment: Align to the average row of the small component, attach to the opposite side of the anchor's average column (left if small's avg col > anchor's, right otherwise), using the anchor's min/max columns to determine edge; try candidate rows from anchor's edge cells, sorted by proximity to small's avg row; place in a straight horizontal line if space is free.
 * For banners (unattached smalls): Sort by average column, place vertically from the bottom up (starting at row = rows-1 down to row = rows-size), in rounded average column +/- small deltas (0-5) to find free space; allow partial placement if full height unavailable, but prioritize full if possible; bottom alignment means the lowest row is always at the grid bottom if possible.
 * After removal and re-placement, the grid should reconstruct a coherent image without floating parts; preserve all large components unchanged.
 * Subtle: Union multiple small components of the same color if they group to the same anchor; treat union as single block for size/avg calculations but place as horizontal strip; banners are placed after attachments, and only if not attached.
 * Edge cases: Empty components, zero adjacencies, partial overlaps in placement checks, grid boundaries for placement, diagonal-only adjacencies not counting as touching for small/large distinction but do for grouping.
 * Avoid over-placement: Check new_g for zeros before placing; no overwriting existing cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import copy

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connected neighbors, essential for component finding and adjacency counting.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This performs flood-fill to extract all connected components per color, crucial for identifying small vs. large.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(This checks if a component touches the grid border, key for distinguishing small enclosed ones.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Tuple[List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]], Set[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    small_pos: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border_flag = touches_border(comp, rows, cols)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border_flag:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
                for p in comp:
                    small_pos.add(p)
    return small, small_pos
```
(This filters and collects small components with positions, used for removal and grouping; note the redundant third element in tuple, could be simplified.)

```python
def build_groups(small_components: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]], g: List[List[int]], small_pos_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[Tuple[int, int], List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    groups: Dict[Tuple[int, int], List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for color, _, positions in small_components:
        adj_counts: Dict[int, int] = defaultdict(int)
        for r, c in positions:
            for nr, nc in get_neighbors(r, c, rows, cols):
                lcol = g[nr][nc]
                if lcol > 0 and (nr, nc) not in small_pos_set:
                    adj_counts[lcol] += 1
        if adj_counts:
            best_l = max(adj_counts, key=adj_counts.get)
            groups[(best_l, color)].append(positions)
        else:
            groups[(0, color)].append(positions)
    return groups
```
(This groups smalls by best adjacent large color via adjacency counts, essential for attachment logic.)

```python
def get_large_pos(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], color: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    pos = []
    for comp in components.get(color, []):
        if len(comp) >= 8 or touches_border(comp, rows, cols):
            pos.extend(comp)
    return pos
```
(This extracts positions of large components for anchor calculations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small components, as train 1 and 3 passed fully.
 * Horizontal attachment logic works in cases where small components align well with anchor edges, as seen in train 3's correct output.
 * Banner placement partially works: It sorts by avg column and tries bottom alignment with deltas, succeeding in train 1, but in train 2, it incorrectly placed a vertical strip of 6's in column 7 rows 0-4 (top-aligned instead of bottom), and failed to place 9's as a short vertical in column 2 rows 0-2; additionally, some 6's were not attached properly to the right side.
 * In train 2, generated output has 3's preserved correctly but 6's over-placed in wrong vertical position and 9's missing entirely from expected top-left; expected shows 9's as a small vertical banner at top (not bottom?), 6's attached horizontally/vertically to the right structure, suggesting banner placement may need top/bottom flexibility or different alignment priority.
 * Grouping by max adjacency succeeds in train 1/3 but likely misgrouped in train 2 (e.g., 9's treated as unattached but placed wrong, or 6's attached to wrong anchor).
 * Union of same-color smalls is handled but may not preserve original shape—places as horizontal strip, which mismatched in train 2 where expected 6's are not fully horizontal.
 * Removal step works (smalls zeroed out), but re-placement overwrites checks are present yet failed to find optimal spots in train 2.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though try_horizontal_attachment may need refinement for vertical-ish attachments or better row candidate selection (e.g., it assumes strict horizontal placement, but expected may allow slight vertical offset).
 * compute_average_row/col and compute_min_max are helpful utilities for positioning but may need rounding/handling for non-integer avgs in placement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves large components like the 2's horizontal bar in row 2, vertical 2's in col 10, 9's/7's/8's structure on bottom-left/mid-right, but re-places smalls: a vertical 4 in col7 rows0-1 (possibly a banner), scattered 2's attached below the main 2-bar in row4 col5-9, and no visible re-placement for other smalls like potential 9's extensions.
 * It does not look fully correct: The 4's seem like a short banner but placed at top (row0-1) instead of bottom, similar to train 2's misalignment; additional 2's in row1 col10 and row3 col10/12 may be partial attachments but don't align horizontally to a clear anchor edge (e.g., the main 2-bar's right side at col10-11); expected likely needs the small 4 (probably from top-right) attached horizontally to the 2-bar's right or as bottom banner, and any other smalls (e.g., isolated 9 or 8) unioned/attached to the bottom structure without top placements.
 * Missing: No horizontal attachment visible for the small 2's group near the bar (row3 col4-5? wait, input has them already attached?); test input shows small enclosed? 2's in row2 col4-10 (size>8? no, wait input analysis needed), but generated adds extra 2's in row4, suggesting over-attachment or wrong union; 8's in row7-11 col9-12 seem preserved but may need small 8 detached/re-attached.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (some banners/attachments) but fails on alignment (top vs bottom, horizontal strictness), likely incorrect for the same reasons as train 2—needs better banner bottom priority and flexible attachment shapes.

[2025-10-01 15:38:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components (likely "floating" or temporary objects) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned according to rules like attaching them to larger "static" structures (colors 3 and 4) or placing them as vertical banners in optimal columns, simulating gravity, attachment, or alignment in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components using 8-directional neighborhood connectivity for same-color cells.
 * Distinguish "static" large or border-touching components (e.g., colors 3 and 4 are treated as anchors; components touching borders or >=8 cells are static and not moved).
 * Remove small dynamic components (<8 cells, not touching borders) entirely from the grid.
 * For re-placement: Prioritize attaching linear (horizontal span equals size) components to the nearest static color based on adjacency counts, placing them horizontally adjacent to the static structure's edge (left or right side based on average column position), at the row closest to the dynamic component's average row.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., blocked cells or non-linear shape), treat as "banners": Cluster by average column position (group if within <3 columns), compute row span, place vertically in the highest possible row band (aligned to max height of all banners), in a rounded average column, scanning ±5 columns for free space.
 * Subtleties: Attachments must check for blocking (non-zero cells in target positions); unions of multiple components per color/group when attaching; banners align to a global max height starting from top; prefer higher adjacency count for anchor choice, tie-break by lower color ID; linear check is strictly size == col_span (ignores row span, assumes horizontal linearity); empty or zero-size components return neutral bounds/averages; deep copy grid to avoid modifying original during processing.
 * Edge cases: Components with no adjacency default to banners; overlapping unions in attachments; vertical placements must fit within rows and not overlap existing cells; border-touching prevents movement even if small; colors beyond 3/4 are dynamic.
 * Potential misses: Directionality of attachment (e.g., always to the "outer" side?); shape preservation (current code flattens to lines or singles, may lose original form); gravity-like falling if no attachment; clustering threshold (3.0 units) may group unrelated banners; placement deltas (±5) might overshoot or miss optimal spots; no rotation or reshaping of components.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small dynamic components (<8 cells, non-border-touching) while preserving static ones (3 and 4, or border-touching), using solid component extraction via DFS/stack and 8-connectivity.
 * Attachment logic partially works by counting adjacencies to static colors and unioning same-color groups, but fails in placement: In Training 1, the 6 (vertical line, size=3, col_span=1 != size so not linear) is removed but not reattached to the right of the 4 blob (expected at rows 3-4, cols 7-8 as [6,6] horizontal? Wait, expected shows single 6's at [2,0] and [3,7-8] but mismatched; generated places vertical 6's on left border rows 0-2 col0, and 7's (small L-shape?) on bottom right cols10-11 rows7-8, while expected has 6 at [2,0] (odd) and 6's at [3,7-8], 7's shifted left in row10 cols1-2 attached to 3's—unknown why 6 at [2,0] in expected, but generated ignores linearity for 6 and places wrongly on border.
 * In Training 2, removal works (9's and 6's cleared), but re-placement errs: Generated places vertical 9's on left cols0-1 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col3, 6 at row2 col2 (scattered), while expected attaches 9's as vertical on col2 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col7, 6's horizontally attached to 3's at rows4-5 cols6-8/9—generated treats 9's as attachable but picks wrong anchor/side, and 6's not attached properly (possibly banner-clustered wrong).
 * In Training 3, identifies 7 (vertical size=3<8, non-border) and 6 (large blob, static), removes 7 but places it vertically on left border cols0 rows0-2, while expected places it vertically on col5 rows0-2 attached right of where 7 was? (overlaps original position? No, expected shifts 7 right to col5, but 6 remains—wait, generated keeps 6 intact but misplaces 7 on wrong side; linearity check fails as col_span=1==size, but attachment to 6 (not static 3/4) ignored since only 3/4 are anchors.
 * Banner clustering sorts by avg col and groups if <3 apart, places vertically at max_h - span, scanning ±5 cols, but in Train1, 7's become banner but placed right (col10-11) instead of left-attached to 3's; in Train2, 6's/9's clustered wrong leading to left placements vs expected right/top.
 * Overall, worked: Component finding, removal, unioning, spans/averages, border checks. Didn't work: Anchor limited to 3/4 (Train3 needs attachment to 6?); linearity assumes horizontal only (verticals like 6/7/9 fail attachment); side choice (avg_c_s < avg_c_a picks left, but often needs right); placement ignores original shape (flattens to line/single col for banners); no fallback to borders or gravity; blocked checks prevent some but default to wrong banner spots; in Train1, can_place for 6 ignores vertical nature.
 * Function `get_anchor_positions` is helpful for static pos but limited to specific colors. The main `program` integrates all but has flawed decision tree (e.g., dynamic_small_comps append comp, but later union only for attachments).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It retains some original 2's (e.g., vertical at col4 rows0-1, horizontal at row2 cols5-9, scattered at row3 col10 and row4 cols5-9) but adds/modifies others (e.g., 2 at row3 col4? No, output shows partial 2's retained/repurposed, but introduces no clear attachments—4's at row3 cols6-8 untouched (static?), 9's/7/8 at bottom scattered/retained without removal, no banners placed; expected likely removes small 2's (the floating horizontal/vertical groups <8, non-border), attaches 2's to 4's (right side?), and handles bottom 7/8/9 as banners or attachments (e.g., 7 horizontal at row9 cols2-3 attached down from 9's? 8's vertical on right, 9's L-shape). Differences: No removal of small 2's (e.g., row2 cols5-9 should move), bottom components not repositioned (7/8/9/2 scattered as-is vs likely vertical banners in cols rounded to avg, e.g., 8's at col9-10 vertical, 7 at col2-3); 4's static ok, but no 2 attachment (e.g., expected 2's horizontal right of 4's at row3 cols9-?); overall, output looks like partial retention with minimal changes, missing core removal/replacement—does not make sense as it ignores dynamic rules for 2/7/8/9.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small, enclosed components (fewer than 8 cells, not touching the border) represent "floating" or detached parts that need to be removed from their current positions and reattached horizontally to the nearest adjacent large component (size >=8 or border-touching) based on maximum adjacency, or if unattached, placed as vertical "banners" at the bottom of the grid, sorted by their average column position and aligned to the bottom with partial placement if needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are identified using 8-connected neighborhood (including diagonals), so adjacency considers all eight directions.
 * Small components are strictly those with size <8 that do not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); larger or border-touching ones are considered "large" and anchors for attachment.
 * When grouping small components, count adjacencies only to non-small cells of large components; choose the anchor color with the maximum adjacency count; if tied or zero, they become unattached banners.
 * Horizontal attachment: Align to the average row of the small component, attach to the opposite side of the anchor's average column (left if small's avg col > anchor's, right otherwise), using the anchor's min/max columns to determine edge; try candidate rows from anchor's edge cells, sorted by proximity to small's avg row; place in a straight horizontal line if space is free.
 * For banners (unattached smalls): Sort by average column, place vertically from the bottom up (starting at row = rows-1 down to row = rows-size), in rounded average column +/- small deltas (0-5) to find free space; allow partial placement if full height unavailable, but prioritize full if possible; bottom alignment means the lowest row is always at the grid bottom if possible.
 * After removal and re-placement, the grid should reconstruct a coherent image without floating parts; preserve all large components unchanged.
 * Subtle: Union multiple small components of the same color if they group to the same anchor; treat union as single block for size/avg calculations but place as horizontal strip; banners are placed after attachments, and only if not attached.
 * Edge cases: Empty components, zero adjacencies, partial overlaps in placement checks, grid boundaries for placement, diagonal-only adjacencies not counting as touching for small/large distinction but do for grouping.
 * Avoid over-placement: Check new_g for zeros before placing; no overwriting existing cells.

        else:
            groups[(0, color)].append(positions)
    return groups
```
(This groups smalls by best adjacent large color via adjacency counts, essential for attachment logic.)

    pos = []

        if len(comp) >= 8 or touches_border(comp, rows, cols):
            pos.extend(comp)
    return pos
```
(This extracts positions of large components for anchor calculations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small components, as train 1 and 3 passed fully.
 * Horizontal attachment logic works in cases where small components align well with anchor edges, as seen in train 3's correct output.
 * Banner placement partially works: It sorts by avg column and tries bottom alignment with deltas, succeeding in train 1, but in train 2, it incorrectly placed a vertical strip of 6's in column 7 rows 0-4 (top-aligned instead of bottom), and failed to place 9's as a short vertical in column 2 rows 0-2; additionally, some 6's were not attached properly to the right side.
 * In train 2, generated output has 3's preserved correctly but 6's over-placed in wrong vertical position and 9's missing entirely from expected top-left; expected shows 9's as a small vertical banner at top (not bottom?), 6's attached horizontally/vertically to the right structure, suggesting banner placement may need top/bottom flexibility or different alignment priority.
 * Grouping by max adjacency succeeds in train 1/3 but likely misgrouped in train 2 (e.g., 9's treated as unattached but placed wrong, or 6's attached to wrong anchor).
 * Union of same-color smalls is handled but may not preserve original shape—places as horizontal strip, which mismatched in train 2 where expected 6's are not fully horizontal.
 * Removal step works (smalls zeroed out), but re-placement overwrites checks are present yet failed to find optimal spots in train 2.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though try_horizontal_attachment may need refinement for vertical-ish attachments or better row candidate selection (e.g., it assumes strict horizontal placement, but expected may allow slight vertical offset).
 * compute_average_row/col and compute_min_max are helpful utilities for positioning but may need rounding/handling for non-integer avgs in placement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves large components like the 2's horizontal bar in row 2, vertical 2's in col 10, 9's/7's/8's structure on bottom-left/mid-right, but re-places smalls: a vertical 4 in col7 rows0-1 (possibly a banner), scattered 2's attached below the main 2-bar in row4 col5-9, and no visible re-placement for other smalls like potential 9's extensions.
 * It does not look fully correct: The 4's seem like a short banner but placed at top (row0-1) instead of bottom, similar to train 2's misalignment; additional 2's in row1 col10 and row3 col10/12 may be partial attachments but don't align horizontally to a clear anchor edge (e.g., the main 2-bar's right side at col10-11); expected likely needs the small 4 (probably from top-right) attached horizontally to the 2-bar's right or as bottom banner, and any other smalls (e.g., isolated 9 or 8) unioned/attached to the bottom structure without top placements.
 * Missing: No horizontal attachment visible for the small 2's group near the bar (row3 col4-5? wait, input has them already attached?); test input shows small enclosed? 2's in row2 col4-10 (size>8? no, wait input analysis needed), but generated adds extra 2's in row4, suggesting over-attachment or wrong union; 8's in row7-11 col9-12 seem preserved but may need small 8 detached/re-attached.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (some banners/attachments) but fails on alignment (top vs bottom, horizontal strictness), likely incorrect for the same reasons as train 2—needs better banner bottom priority and flexible attachment shapes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

(Finds the primary large anchor per color; assumes one, but puzzle may have multiples—subtle issue if multiples exist.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single provided attempt (this program) correctly handles training example 1 and 3, successfully removing and reattaching small components for dynamic colors (e.g., placing 9's in expected linear extensions or unions without extras/misses).
 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where connected components of the same color are identified and classified as static/large (if color 3 or 4, size >=8, or touching the border) or small/movable (otherwise). Small components are removed and then repositioned either by attaching them as horizontal or vertical banners to the edges of adjacent large components (preferring orientation based on their shape) or, if unplaced, as vertical banners sorted by average column position at the top of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood fill to find connected groups.
 * Static/large components stay in place; small ones are erased first, then placed without overlapping anything.
 * For attachment: Prefer horizontal placement if the small component spans more columns than rows (or equal, default to horizontal); vertical otherwise. Align to the edge of the large component (left/right or top/bottom) based on average positions, using candidate rows/columns from the anchor's edge, sorted by proximity to the small's average.
 * For vertical attachment, if the preferred side (above/below based on averages) fails due to space or overlap, try the opposite side.
 * Unplaced smalls form "banner groups" unioned by best anchor color; if no anchor, treat as free-floating. Place free or unattachable groups as vertical banners at the top, starting from a height based on the max length of such groups, centered roughly on their average column (with delta trials for fitting).
 * Subtlety: Banners must fit exactly in free space (all zeros) without partial overlaps; length is based on distinct rows/cols in the union. Sorting banners by average column ensures left-to-right order.
 * Edge cases: Empty components return defaults (e.g., avg 0); ensure bounds checking for placements. Groups with same anchor and color are unioned before placement.
 * When placing banners at top, the start row is max_h - length, but max_h is max distinct rows of banners—ensures they stack without overlap, but may clip if too tall (though grids seem to fit).
 * Adjacency for anchoring counts neighboring large cells (8-dir) to choose best anchor by max touches; only anchor if large and >0 touches.
 * Potential miss: In vertical placement fallback, the code has a nested loop that breaks correctly only if placed, but may skip some candidates if outer loop breaks prematurely.
 * All placements use the original small color; no color changes.

                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is essential for correctly extracting 8-connected components per color; uses DFS stack for efficiency.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
```
(Helpful for classifying border-touching components as static/large.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(Useful for merging positions of grouped small components before computing averages or shapes.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n

def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(These are helpful for determining placement sides (e.g., avg positions for left/right) and bounds for edge alignment; min/max useful for edge refs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles component extraction and classification (static if color 3/4, size >=8, or border-touching; smalls otherwise), as evidenced by training 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * Training 1 correct: All smalls placed properly, likely attached or as banners matching expected.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places two 9s horizontally at top-left (rows 0-2, cols 2-2 but duplicated), and 6s incorrectly (one at row2 col7, others scattered at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8) instead of expected (9s vertical at col2 rows0-2 and one at row2 col7; 6s more integrated at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8 but with an extra at row2 col7 as 9? Wait, expected has 9 at row2 col7, 6s starting row3 col7 downward rightward—mismatch in 6 placement positions and missing integration; unknown why horizontal preference failed for 9s or why 6s didn't attach vertically to 3s properly).
 * Training 3 correct: Placements matched, suggesting vertical/horizontal logic works for some shapes/anchors.
 * Attempt groups smalls by best anchor (max adjacent large color), unions them, and prefers orientation (horizontal if wider), but in training 2, this led to misplacement of 9s (treated as horizontal banner?) and 6s (partial attachment but wrong side/position).
 * Banner fallback at top sorts by avg col and trials deltas/signs for fitting, but in training 2, it placed 9s too clustered/left without proper vertical stacking, and 6s overlapped or ignored anchor.
 * The vertical placement fallback (trying opposite side) is included but buggy in training 2—code has nested loops that may not fully explore candidates, leading to unplaced 6s defaulting incorrectly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., neighbors, components) are relevant, though the main program logic needs tuning for side selection and candidate sorting.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 2s in a scattered way (e.g., top rows have 2s at col10-11 row0, col7/10 row1, dense row2 cols5-9, row3 col10, row4 cols5-9) which seems like partial re-placement of a large 2 blob, but likely incorrect as it doesn't erase and reattach smalls properly—appears to leave some original positions or fail unioning, resulting in non-contiguous banners; expected should erase small 2s/others, attach to large 4 (at row3 cols6-8?) perhaps vertically below, and place 9/7/8 as banners or attachments to borders/statics, but output has 9s/7s/8s mostly original with no clear movement (e.g., 9s at rows7-11 cols1-4/8, 7s row9-11 col2-3, 8s row7-11 col9-11)—no top banners visible, suggesting attachment logic failed for most smalls, leaving grid almost unchanged except top 2s messed up; this does not make sense as smalls like isolated 9s/7s/8 should move/attach, and 2s should form clean banners.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import math

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 15:45:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components are identified, temporarily removed, and then re-placed by attaching them to larger or border-touching structures, often as horizontal or vertical extensions (like bars or lines) to form coherent shapes, possibly letters or symbols. The goal is to clean up fragmented small blobs and integrate them logically adjacent to main components, preserving overall structure while ensuring placements align with spatial preferences (e.g., horizontal for wide shapes, vertical for tall ones).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "small" components as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement to avoid clutter.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any that touch the border; small components should attach to these, preferring the most adjacent large color as an "anchor."
 * Placement orientation: Prefer horizontal if the small component's column span >= row span (treat as a bar/line), vertical otherwise; align placements to the edge of the large component (left/right for horizontal, above/below for vertical) using average row/col positions for best fit.
 * Edge alignment: For attachments, use the min/max rows/cols of the large component's edge, sort candidate positions by proximity to the small component's average position, and check for empty space before placing.
 * Fallback for vertical placements: If can't attach above/below due to borders, place as a "top banner" vertical line, aligning multiple such banners to share a common bottom row for uniformity, and shift columns if blocked.
 * Union positions: When grouping multiple small components by anchor color, treat them as a single shape for span/average calculations to place cohesively.
 * Subtleties: Horizontal placements scan rows on the large's edge column; vertical on columns of the large's edge row. Clamping or skipping if out-of-bounds. 8-connectivity for components (includes diagonals). Deep copy the grid before modifications. Averages use floats and rounding for target positions. If no anchor, default to top banner fallback.
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching overrides size for "large" status; attachments count adjacency to any non-small cell of the anchor color post-removal. Multiple small comps per color group into one placement. Length is the span in preferred direction, but placement assumes straight lines (not the actual shape). Top banners align to max length for synchronization, starting from adjusted bottom row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Removal sets to 0 only small non-border comps; re-placement fills straight lines of the computed length, ignoring original shape (assumes line-like). No overlapping placements checked beyond empty space. Handles empty unions gracefully. Potential issue: Over-attachment or wrong edge selection if averages misalign (e.g., left vs right).

(Unifies positions from multiple components; helpful for grouping small comps per anchor.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core component detection, small/large distinction, and basic attachment logic works for simple cases.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places two 9's vertically in col 2 (rows 0-2) correctly but adds an extra 9 in row 2 col 7 prematurely; places 6's as a short vertical in col 7 rows 1-3 instead of integrating into the main 6 structure (expected has 6's horizontal in row 4 cols 6-8 and vertical extensions); 3's bottom structure untouched but small 3's not reattached properly—suggests wrong anchor selection or edge miscalculation for 6's/9's.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places 7's as vertical in col 4 rows 0-3 (shifted left), but expected is col 5 rows 0-2 (right-aligned to 6's); 6's main structure correct, but 7's attachment fails due to avg_col misalignment or wrong edge choice (above the 6's horizontal bar).
 * General issues: Attachments sometimes choose wrong side (left vs right, above vs below) based on averages; top banner fallback not triggered or misaligned in train 3; grouping multiple small comps leads to over-long placements; straight-line filling ignores original shape, causing mismatches if small comp isn't line-like.
 * Function `program` overall: Helpful structure but flawed in placement logic (e.g., candidate sorting by abs distance works but may need tie-breaking; no handling for multiple anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though adjacency counting in groups could be refined to weight by shared edges.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It removes and re-places small components (e.g., a vertical 4 in col 3 rows 0-2, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-10 attached below it, vertical 2's in col 10 rows 3-5); lower section has 9's scattered/replaced (e.g., vertical-ish in col 1 rows 7-11 with extensions), 7's horizontal in row 9 cols 2-3, and 8's vertical in col 9 rows 7-11—but this fragments the original 9/7/8 structures unnaturally (original has clustered 9's left, 7's middle, 8's right); expected likely integrates small 4/2's as banners or side attachments without disrupting the main letter-like forms (possibly "P42" or similar above, "HI" below), with 2's as a horizontal bar under 4, 8's extending right, but generated shifts 4 left of expected position and over-extends 2's/9's, missing tight alignments—difference likely from avg-based edge selection failing on complex shapes or poor union handling for multi-comp groups.

[2025-10-01 15:45:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components (likely "floating" or temporary objects) must be identified, removed from their original positions, and repositioned according to rules like attaching them to larger "static" structures (colors 3 and 4) or placing them as vertical banners in optimal columns, simulating gravity, attachment, or alignment in a 2D scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify connected components using 8-directional neighborhood connectivity for same-color cells.
 * Distinguish "static" large or border-touching components (e.g., colors 3 and 4 are treated as anchors; components touching borders or >=8 cells are static and not moved).
 * Remove small dynamic components (<8 cells, not touching borders) entirely from the grid.
 * For re-placement: Prioritize attaching linear (horizontal span equals size) components to the nearest static color based on adjacency counts, placing them horizontally adjacent to the static structure's edge (left or right side based on average column position), at the row closest to the dynamic component's average row.
 * If attachment fails (e.g., blocked cells or non-linear shape), treat as "banners": Cluster by average column position (group if within <3 columns), compute row span, place vertically in the highest possible row band (aligned to max height of all banners), in a rounded average column, scanning ±5 columns for free space.
 * Subtleties: Attachments must check for blocking (non-zero cells in target positions); unions of multiple components per color/group when attaching; banners align to a global max height starting from top; prefer higher adjacency count for anchor choice, tie-break by lower color ID; linear check is strictly size == col_span (ignores row span, assumes horizontal linearity); empty or zero-size components return neutral bounds/averages; deep copy grid to avoid modifying original during processing.
 * Edge cases: Components with no adjacency default to banners; overlapping unions in attachments; vertical placements must fit within rows and not overlap existing cells; border-touching prevents movement even if small; colors beyond 3/4 are dynamic.
 * Potential misses: Directionality of attachment (e.g., always to the "outer" side?); shape preservation (current code flattens to lines or singles, may lose original form); gravity-like falling if no attachment; clustering threshold (3.0 units) may group unrelated banners; placement deltas (±5) might overshoot or miss optimal spots; no rotation or reshaping of components.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small dynamic components (<8 cells, non-border-touching) while preserving static ones (3 and 4, or border-touching), using solid component extraction via DFS/stack and 8-connectivity.
 * Attachment logic partially works by counting adjacencies to static colors and unioning same-color groups, but fails in placement: In Training 1, the 6 (vertical line, size=3, col_span=1 != size so not linear) is removed but not reattached to the right of the 4 blob (expected at rows 3-4, cols 7-8 as [6,6] horizontal? Wait, expected shows single 6's at [2,0] and [3,7-8] but mismatched; generated places vertical 6's on left border rows 0-2 col0, and 7's (small L-shape?) on bottom right cols10-11 rows7-8, while expected has 6 at [2,0] (odd) and 6's at [3,7-8], 7's shifted left in row10 cols1-2 attached to 3's—unknown why 6 at [2,0] in expected, but generated ignores linearity for 6 and places wrongly on border.
 * In Training 2, removal works (9's and 6's cleared), but re-placement errs: Generated places vertical 9's on left cols0-1 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col3, 6 at row2 col2 (scattered), while expected attaches 9's as vertical on col2 rows0-2 and horizontal at row2 col7, 6's horizontally attached to 3's at rows4-5 cols6-8/9—generated treats 9's as attachable but picks wrong anchor/side, and 6's not attached properly (possibly banner-clustered wrong).
 * In Training 3, identifies 7 (vertical size=3<8, non-border) and 6 (large blob, static), removes 7 but places it vertically on left border cols0 rows0-2, while expected places it vertically on col5 rows0-2 attached right of where 7 was? (overlaps original position? No, expected shifts 7 right to col5, but 6 remains—wait, generated keeps 6 intact but misplaces 7 on wrong side; linearity check fails as col_span=1==size, but attachment to 6 (not static 3/4) ignored since only 3/4 are anchors.
 * Banner clustering sorts by avg col and groups if <3 apart, places vertically at max_h - span, scanning ±5 cols, but in Train1, 7's become banner but placed right (col10-11) instead of left-attached to 3's; in Train2, 6's/9's clustered wrong leading to left placements vs expected right/top.
 * Overall, worked: Component finding, removal, unioning, spans/averages, border checks. Didn't work: Anchor limited to 3/4 (Train3 needs attachment to 6?); linearity assumes horizontal only (verticals like 6/7/9 fail attachment); side choice (avg_c_s < avg_c_a picks left, but often needs right); placement ignores original shape (flattens to line/single col for banners); no fallback to borders or gravity; blocked checks prevent some but default to wrong banner spots; in Train1, can_place for 6 ignores vertical nature.
 * Function `get_anchor_positions` is helpful for static pos but limited to specific colors. The main `program` integrates all but has flawed decision tree (e.g., dynamic_small_comps append comp, but later union only for attachments).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It retains some original 2's (e.g., vertical at col4 rows0-1, horizontal at row2 cols5-9, scattered at row3 col10 and row4 cols5-9) but adds/modifies others (e.g., 2 at row3 col4? No, output shows partial 2's retained/repurposed, but introduces no clear attachments—4's at row3 cols6-8 untouched (static?), 9's/7/8 at bottom scattered/retained without removal, no banners placed; expected likely removes small 2's (the floating horizontal/vertical groups <8, non-border), attaches 2's to 4's (right side?), and handles bottom 7/8/9 as banners or attachments (e.g., 7 horizontal at row9 cols2-3 attached down from 9's? 8's vertical on right, 9's L-shape). Differences: No removal of small 2's (e.g., row2 cols5-9 should move), bottom components not repositioned (7/8/9/2 scattered as-is vs likely vertical banners in cols rounded to avg, e.g., 8's at col9-10 vertical, 7 at col2-3); 4's static ok, but no 2 attachment (e.g., expected 2's horizontal right of 4's at row3 cols9-?); overall, output looks like partial retention with minimal changes, missing core removal/replacement—does not make sense as it ignores dynamic rules for 2/7/8/9.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to rearrange small connected components (blobs of the same color, <8 cells, not touching the grid border) by moving them to attach adjacently (8-way) to the "best" large component (≥8 cells or border-touching, preferring the one with most adjacent cells, excluding other small components), prioritizing self-attachment if no external large is found; if attachment fails, fallback to linear vertical placement at the top of the grid near the small component's average column position, skipping occupied cells if needed. The output is a modified grid with small components removed from originals and placed in new positions, preserving all other elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected via 8-way adjacency (not just 4-way), which is crucial for identifying blobs and checking attachments.
 * Small components are strictly <8 cells and must not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); large ones are ≥8 cells or any that touch border, even if small.
 * Grouping: Small components group by their "best large" (most adjacent non-small cells of another color) or self-color if no external large; multiple smalls can attach to the same large.
 * Attachment prefers horizontal linear placement adjacent to the large's extreme column (left/right based on small's average column relative to large's), at the row closest to small's average row on the large's edge; if no fit, fallback to vertical top placement.
 * Fallback placement: Vertical linear from row 0 downward in a column near the small's average column (try ±5 offset for fit, then skip occupied); horizontal fallback only if explicitly checked and fits.
 * Average positions (row/col) guide placement to keep spatial relation; use rounding for column selection.
 * Grid boundaries and existing occupations must be respected—no overwriting; deduplicate positions in unions.
 * Subtle: Self-attachment uses same color's large component if available; exclude small positions from adjacency counts to avoid false positives.
 * Potential misses: No rotation or non-linear shapes in placement (always linear horizontal/vertical); no merging of same-color smalls unless grouped; border-touching overrides size for "large" status.
 * Error-prone: Python's round() is built-in, not in math module—using math.round causes execution failure.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly solved Training example 1, demonstrating understanding of component detection, small/large identification, grouping by best large (or self), horizontal attachment preference, and top fallback placement.
 * Failed on Training examples 2 and 3, and test input, due to execution error from using math.round (math module lacks round; it's a built-in function)—this prevented any output generation, despite logic seeming sound for train 1.
 * Core logic for 8-way connectivity, adjacency counting (excluding smalls), and linear placements (horizontal to extreme edge, vertical fallback) worked for train 1 but untested on others due to bug.
 * Grouping multiple smalls to same large via union positions is helpful and worked implicitly in train 1.
 * Self-attachment check (to own color's large if no external) is a subtle but correct inclusion.
 * Fallback skipping occupied cells in vertical placement is essential but untested due to error.
 * No unhelpful functions noted—all provided (e.g., get_best_large, get_union_positions) align with puzzle needs, though get_best_large could be refined for ties (uses max adj count).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input due to execution error (math.round), so cannot evaluate correctness—expected a modified grid with small components relocated/attached, but instead crashed entirely.
 * Similarly, no outputs for train 2/3, differing from expectation of valid grids; the error halts all processing after import, making it impossible to verify if logic handles test-specific cases like multiple groups, border interactions, or failed fits.
 * Without output, cannot confirm if test would match puzzle solution (e.g., correct attachments or top placements); bug masks any deeper issues like incorrect extreme column selection or row choice.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where small, enclosed components (fewer than 8 cells, not touching the border) represent "floating" or detached parts that need to be removed from their current positions and reattached horizontally to the nearest adjacent large component (size >=8 or border-touching) based on maximum adjacency, or if unattached, placed as vertical "banners" at the bottom of the grid, sorted by their average column position and aligned to the bottom with partial placement if needed.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are identified using 8-connected neighborhood (including diagonals), so adjacency considers all eight directions.
 * Small components are strictly those with size <8 that do not touch any border (top, bottom, left, right); larger or border-touching ones are considered "large" and anchors for attachment.
 * When grouping small components, count adjacencies only to non-small cells of large components; choose the anchor color with the maximum adjacency count; if tied or zero, they become unattached banners.
 * Horizontal attachment: Align to the average row of the small component, attach to the opposite side of the anchor's average column (left if small's avg col > anchor's, right otherwise), using the anchor's min/max columns to determine edge; try candidate rows from anchor's edge cells, sorted by proximity to small's avg row; place in a straight horizontal line if space is free.
 * For banners (unattached smalls): Sort by average column, place vertically from the bottom up (starting at row = rows-1 down to row = rows-size), in rounded average column +/- small deltas (0-5) to find free space; allow partial placement if full height unavailable, but prioritize full if possible; bottom alignment means the lowest row is always at the grid bottom if possible.
 * After removal and re-placement, the grid should reconstruct a coherent image without floating parts; preserve all large components unchanged.
 * Subtle: Union multiple small components of the same color if they group to the same anchor; treat union as single block for size/avg calculations but place as horizontal strip; banners are placed after attachments, and only if not attached.
 * Edge cases: Empty components, zero adjacencies, partial overlaps in placement checks, grid boundaries for placement, diagonal-only adjacencies not counting as touching for small/large distinction but do for grouping.
 * Avoid over-placement: Check new_g for zeros before placing; no overwriting existing cells.

            pos.extend(comp)
    return pos
```
(This extracts positions of large components for anchor calculations.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly identifies and removes small components, as train 1 and 3 passed fully.
 * Horizontal attachment logic works in cases where small components align well with anchor edges, as seen in train 3's correct output.
 * Banner placement partially works: It sorts by avg column and tries bottom alignment with deltas, succeeding in train 1, but in train 2, it incorrectly placed a vertical strip of 6's in column 7 rows 0-4 (top-aligned instead of bottom), and failed to place 9's as a short vertical in column 2 rows 0-2; additionally, some 6's were not attached properly to the right side.
 * In train 2, generated output has 3's preserved correctly but 6's over-placed in wrong vertical position and 9's missing entirely from expected top-left; expected shows 9's as a small vertical banner at top (not bottom?), 6's attached horizontally/vertically to the right structure, suggesting banner placement may need top/bottom flexibility or different alignment priority.
 * Grouping by max adjacency succeeds in train 1/3 but likely misgrouped in train 2 (e.g., 9's treated as unattached but placed wrong, or 6's attached to wrong anchor).
 * Union of same-color smalls is handled but may not preserve original shape—places as horizontal strip, which mismatched in train 2 where expected 6's are not fully horizontal.
 * Removal step works (smalls zeroed out), but re-placement overwrites checks are present yet failed to find optimal spots in train 2.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though try_horizontal_attachment may need refinement for vertical-ish attachments or better row candidate selection (e.g., it assumes strict horizontal placement, but expected may allow slight vertical offset).
 * compute_average_row/col and compute_min_max are helpful utilities for positioning but may need rounding/handling for non-integer avgs in placement.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output preserves large components like the 2's horizontal bar in row 2, vertical 2's in col 10, 9's/7's/8's structure on bottom-left/mid-right, but re-places smalls: a vertical 4 in col7 rows0-1 (possibly a banner), scattered 2's attached below the main 2-bar in row4 col5-9, and no visible re-placement for other smalls like potential 9's extensions.
 * It does not look fully correct: The 4's seem like a short banner but placed at top (row0-1) instead of bottom, similar to train 2's misalignment; additional 2's in row1 col10 and row3 col10/12 may be partial attachments but don't align horizontally to a clear anchor edge (e.g., the main 2-bar's right side at col10-11); expected likely needs the small 4 (probably from top-right) attached horizontally to the 2-bar's right or as bottom banner, and any other smalls (e.g., isolated 9 or 8) unioned/attached to the bottom structure without top placements.
 * Missing: No horizontal attachment visible for the small 2's group near the bar (row3 col4-5? wait, input has them already attached?); test input shows small enclosed? 2's in row2 col4-10 (size>8? no, wait input analysis needed), but generated adds extra 2's in row4, suggesting over-attachment or wrong union; 8's in row7-11 col9-12 seem preserved but may need small 8 detached/re-attached.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (some banners/attachments) but fails on alignment (top vs bottom, horizontal strictness), likely incorrect for the same reasons as train 2—needs better banner bottom priority and flexible attachment shapes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers as colors) where small, disconnected components are identified, temporarily removed, and then re-placed by attaching them to larger or border-touching structures, often as horizontal or vertical extensions (like bars or lines) to form coherent shapes, possibly letters or symbols. The goal is to clean up fragmented small blobs and integrate them logically adjacent to main components, preserving overall structure while ensuring placements align with spatial preferences (e.g., horizontal for wide shapes, vertical for tall ones).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify "small" components as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement to avoid clutter.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any that touch the border; small components should attach to these, preferring the most adjacent large color as an "anchor."
 * Placement orientation: Prefer horizontal if the small component's column span >= row span (treat as a bar/line), vertical otherwise; align placements to the edge of the large component (left/right for horizontal, above/below for vertical) using average row/col positions for best fit.
 * Edge alignment: For attachments, use the min/max rows/cols of the large component's edge, sort candidate positions by proximity to the small component's average position, and check for empty space before placing.
 * Fallback for vertical placements: If can't attach above/below due to borders, place as a "top banner" vertical line, aligning multiple such banners to share a common bottom row for uniformity, and shift columns if blocked.
 * Union positions: When grouping multiple small components by anchor color, treat them as a single shape for span/average calculations to place cohesively.
 * Subtleties: Horizontal placements scan rows on the large's edge column; vertical on columns of the large's edge row. Clamping or skipping if out-of-bounds. 8-connectivity for components (includes diagonals). Deep copy the grid before modifications. Averages use floats and rounding for target positions. If no anchor, default to top banner fallback.
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching overrides size for "large" status; attachments count adjacency to any non-small cell of the anchor color post-removal. Multiple small comps per color group into one placement. Length is the span in preferred direction, but placement assumes straight lines (not the actual shape). Top banners align to max length for synchronization, starting from adjusted bottom row.
 * Considerations across attempts: Removal sets to 0 only small non-border comps; re-placement fills straight lines of the computed length, ignoring original shape (assumes line-like). No overlapping placements checked beyond empty space. Handles empty unions gracefully. Potential issue: Over-attachment or wrong edge selection if averages misalign (e.g., left vs right).

(Unifies positions from multiple components; helpful for grouping small comps per anchor.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct overall, indicating core component detection, small/large distinction, and basic attachment logic works for simple cases.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated places two 9's vertically in col 2 (rows 0-2) correctly but adds an extra 9 in row 2 col 7 prematurely; places 6's as a short vertical in col 7 rows 1-3 instead of integrating into the main 6 structure (expected has 6's horizontal in row 4 cols 6-8 and vertical extensions); 3's bottom structure untouched but small 3's not reattached properly—suggests wrong anchor selection or edge miscalculation for 6's/9's.
 * Training example 3: Incorrect; generated places 7's as vertical in col 4 rows 0-3 (shifted left), but expected is col 5 rows 0-2 (right-aligned to 6's); 6's main structure correct, but 7's attachment fails due to avg_col misalignment or wrong edge choice (above the 6's horizontal bar).
 * General issues: Attachments sometimes choose wrong side (left vs right, above vs below) based on averages; top banner fallback not triggered or misaligned in train 3; grouping multiple small comps leads to over-long placements; straight-line filling ignores original shape, causing mismatches if small comp isn't line-like.
 * Function `program` overall: Helpful structure but flawed in placement logic (e.g., candidate sorting by abs distance works but may need tie-breaking; no handling for multiple anchors).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though adjacency counting in groups could be refined to weight by shared edges.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It removes and re-places small components (e.g., a vertical 4 in col 3 rows 0-2, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-10 attached below it, vertical 2's in col 10 rows 3-5); lower section has 9's scattered/replaced (e.g., vertical-ish in col 1 rows 7-11 with extensions), 7's horizontal in row 9 cols 2-3, and 8's vertical in col 9 rows 7-11—but this fragments the original 9/7/8 structures unnaturally (original has clustered 9's left, 7's middle, 8's right); expected likely integrates small 4/2's as banners or side attachments without disrupting the main letter-like forms (possibly "P42" or similar above, "HI" below), with 2's as a horizontal bar under 4, 8's extending right, but generated shifts 4 left of expected position and over-extends 2's/9's, missing tight alignments—difference likely from avg-based edge selection failing on complex shapes or poor union handling for multi-comp groups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored components (blobs) where small, isolated components (under 6 cells, not touching borders) attached to larger components must be detached and relocated—either horizontally to the opposite side of the large component's extreme edge or vertically to the top of the grid if horizontal placement is blocked—while preserving the overall structure and color integrity of the blobs. The goal is to "free" these small attachments by moving them without overlapping existing structures, simulating a rearrangement or escape mechanic in a confined space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small components are defined strictly as <6 cells in size and must not touch any grid border (rows 0, rows-1, cols 0, cols-1); larger or border-touching components stay fixed.
 * Components are connected via 8-directional adjacency (including diagonals), so flood-fill (DFS/BFS) is essential for accurate blob detection.
 * Grouping: Small components are grouped by their primary adjacent large color (most adjacent cells); multiple smalls can attach to the same large, forming a union for movement.
 * Movement logic: Calculate row span (vertical extent) of the unioned small positions for length; use average column positions to determine "opposite side" (left if small avg > large avg, right otherwise); place horizontally starting from the large's extreme column (min for left, max for right) in the row of the large's extremest position.
 * Blocked horizontal placement: If the horizontal extension would go out of bounds (e.g., extreme + length >= cols), fall back to vertical placement at the rounded average column of the small group, starting from the top available row (just above the first non-empty row).
 * Trapped smalls: After initial moves, check remaining smalls—if horizontally trapped (both left and right neighbors in their row are non-zero or border), move them vertically upward using their row span length and average column.
 * Subtleties: Always remove originals before placing; vertical placements stack from the top down but adjust start row to avoid negatives (clamp to 0); use original grid for checks, modified grid for placements; colors are positive integers, 0 is empty; unions must deduplicate positions; average columns are floats, rounded for vertical medians.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or zero-length spans skip; no smalls means no changes; multiple vertical placements may overlap columns but not cells (though code doesn't explicitly prevent overlaps); border treated as blocking for trapped checks.
 * Potential misses: Incorrect neighbor directions (must be 8-way); wrong extreme calculation (must find global min/max row for the large's extreme col); vertical start row is dynamic (above first occupied row, not fixed bottom); smalls adjacent only via large non-smalls.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully identifying and moving small components to horizontal or vertical positions without overlaps or border violations.
 * Failed training example 3: Generated output left the horizontal 6's in row 4 cols 4-6 (correct) and a single 6 in row 3 col 5 (partial), but incorrectly kept 7's as a horizontal block in row 7 cols 3-6 and scattered 6's vertically in col 2 rows 6-10 with extras in row 6 col 2 and row 7 col 2; expected vertical 7's stacked in col 5 rows 0-2 (moved up from trapped/blocked state) and clean vertical 6's in col 2 rows 6-10 only, with top rows empty except for those 7's—likely due to flawed trapped detection (didn't trigger vertical for 7's) or incorrect blocked horizontal calc for the large 7 structure.
 * Missed proper vertical fallback for blocked horizontals in train 3: The 7's small attachment should have been blocked on the right (extending beyond cols) and moved vertically to top at avg col ~5, but code placed them horizontally instead or failed to remove/relocate fully.
 * Component finding and small ID are solid (8-way works for train 1/2), but attached_positions may over/under-count if smalls are diagonal-only to large.
 * Grouping by max adj count works for simple cases but may misgroup if ties (uses max key, but no tiebreaker).
 * Trapped handling in handle_trapped_small is partially broken: Uses original g for neighbors but checks all positions uniformly; in train 3, it didn't detect the 7's as trapped post-move, leaving them in place—also, horizontal neighbor check treats border as -1 (non-zero), which is correct but may false-positive if small spans multiple rows.
 * Vertical placement in apply_vertical_placements uses first_nonempty -1 as bottom, which assumes top-down stacking but clamps start_r to 0; in train 3 expected, 7's start at row 0, suggesting bottom_r calc or max_l adjustment is off (possibly needs to place from absolute top if space).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but get_attached_positions and compute_extreme_for_opposite are helpful yet subtle—extreme row selection picks the row with the global min/max col for large, which worked in train 1/2 but may pick wrong row in multi-row larges like train 3's 7's.
 * Overall, core flood-fill and small detection are essential and correct; issues stem from placement logic edges (blocked detection, trapped checks, vertical start rows).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct: It shows vertical 2's in col 10 rows 0-2 and 3, horizontal 2's in row 2 cols 4-8 and row 4 cols 5-9 (seemingly moved right from a large 2 in rows 2/4), but leaves the original 9's and 7's mostly intact with a 8's scattered/moved partially (e.g., 8's in row 7 col 9, row 8 col 10, etc.), and an extra 2 in row 8 col 7 which shouldn't be there—expected likely to move small 2 attachments away from the large 2 blob (cols 4-8 in row 2, cols 5-9 in row 4) to opposite (left?) or vertical top, detach small 7's/9's/8's if qualifying, and clear originals without adding extras; the partial moves suggest grouping/attached detection worked for 2's but failed for others (e.g., 9's in cols 1-4 rows 7-10 look like a large with small attachments not moved).
 * Test output is missing full detachment: Original test input (inferred from generated changes) has a large 2 horizontal in middle rows, small 2's possibly attached below/above, and clustered 9/7/8 on bottom-left; output should relocate smalls (e.g., vertical 2's to top-left if opposite is left, or up if blocked), but keeps bottom clusters almost unchanged—likely trapped detection missed the 7/9/8 smalls as they may touch "borders" or exceed size 5.
 * The horizontal 2 placements in rows 2/4 seem redundant/overlapped with originals (not fully removed), indicating removal step failed for some union_pos; vertical 2's at top-right (col 10) might be correct if opposite side, but length/spacing doesn't match row spans (e.g., row 0-2 vertical but input 2's span ~3-5 cells?).
 * To handle test case, account for multi-large interactions (e.g., 9's adjacent to 7's/8's may confuse best_l grouping) and ensure vertical placements don't clip or overlap existing top empties—output has empties above but misplaced 2 in row 8 suggests post-move trapped check added erroneously.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a grid where numbers represent colored regions or blobs, and the goal is to process dynamic (non-static) colors by identifying connected components, removing small isolated ones, and reattaching or placing them adjacent to larger "anchor" components of the same or adjacent colors (preferring static colors like 3 and 4), following rules for horizontal or vertical attachment to maintain connectivity without overlaps or border violations.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are connected using 8-neighbor adjacency (including diagonals), which is crucial for defining blobs accurately—4-connectivity would break some expected unions.
 * Small components are defined as those with fewer than 8 cells that do not touch the grid border; these are candidates for removal and re-placement, while larger (>=8 cells) or border-touching ones are treated as "large" anchors that persist.
 * Static colors (3 and 4) are never modified or removed; dynamic colors are all others, processed in sorted order (lowest first) to handle layering or priority.
 * When reattaching small components, prioritize adjacency to the "best" large color (the most adjacent cell count, preferring static or lower-numbered colors over higher dynamic ones).
 * Placement logic prefers horizontal attachment first (based on average column position relative to anchor's side—left if small's avg_c > anchor's avg_c), using the closest row on the anchor's edge; if blocked, fallback to vertical attachment above the anchor (top side), using the closest column; final fallback is vertical placement in a single column at the small's average row span, but only if space is free.
 * Subtlety: Unions of multiple small components per color/group are treated as a single entity for average position calculation (row_span and col_span from unique positions), but placement fills a straight line (horizontal or vertical) rather than preserving the original shape, which can lead to mismatches if the original small comps weren't linear.
 * Avoid self-attachment for small comps unless no other anchor; deduplicate union positions to prevent overlaps.
 * Grid is modified in-place via deepcopy, removing smalls first, then placing in dynamic color order—order matters for blocking.
 * Easy to miss: Anchors for dynamic colors may not exist initially (use adjacent large comps), and placement must check bounds and emptiness in new_g (post-removal grid); no diagonal or complex shape placement, only axis-aligned lines.
 * If no valid anchor or space, skip placement entirely (small comps stay removed, which is a failure mode).
 * Across attempts, consider that expected outputs often preserve or extend linear extensions (e.g., adding a cell to make a longer arm), and failures involve misplaced cells (wrong position) or missing cells (skipped due to blocking/invalid anchor).

 * For training example 2, it is incorrect: generated output places an extraneous 9 at row 5, column 9 (extending beyond expected), and misses a 9 at row 2, column 7 (which should extend a vertical or horizontal arm of 9's); this suggests over-placement in fallback logic or incorrect anchor selection for color 9, leading to a skipped valid spot and an invalid one (reason unknown, possibly due to avg position miscalculation or blocking check failure post-removal).
 * Overall, component detection and removal work well (to_remove set correctly identifies smalls), but placement fails when horizontal/vertical checks don't match expected linear fills—e.g., it may choose wrong side (left vs right) or fallback too aggressively.
 * Union of small comps is helpful but assumes linear re-placement, which mismatches if original smalls were scattered (not linear).
 * get_adj_anchor_comps is somewhat helpful for dynamic anchors but can return empty or partial if adjacency is diagonal-only (8-neigh includes, but union may miss).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the final fallback vertical placement in a single column ignores col_span and may over/under-place (e.g., uses row_span but rounds col arbitrarily).
 * Processing dynamic colors in sorted order works for layering but may cause blocking if a later color overwrites space needed for earlier ones.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incorrect overall: it retains static-like regions (e.g., 2's in rows 2-4 forming a horizontal bar with extensions, 4's in row 3, 9's in rows 7-11 forming a snake-like structure with 7's and 8's interspersed), but places 8's and 7's in ways that may not attach properly (e.g., 8 at row7 col9, row8 col10, etc., seems detached or wrongly extended; 7's at row9 col2-3 and row11 col2).
 * It does not look fully correct because small comps for higher colors (e.g., 9,8,7) seem re-placed in vertical/horizontal lines, but the snake of 9's includes gaps filled with other colors (7's inside), suggesting failed skip on occupied space or wrong anchor (e.g., 9's should attach to their own large but instead interleave); expected likely has cleaner attachments without internal overlaps or misses (e.g., 9's forming a solid arm without 7 intrusion, 8's as a separate vertical extension).
 * Missing elements: No clear handling of color 2's small extensions (row4 has 2's that might need union), and row5/6 are empty, possibly skipped due to no anchor, but expected may require fallback placement there.
 * To handle test, update anchor selection to prefer same-color large over adjacent if possible, and add check for multi-comp anchors (current get_large_pos returns only first, may miss better one); also, placement should verify post-place connectivity via 8-neigh to avoid detached results.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) to identify and relocate small, disconnected components (blobs of the same color) that are not touching the border and smaller than a threshold (e.g., <8 cells), placing them as banners from the top border or as attachments (horizontal or vertical extensions) to adjacent large components or border-touching blobs, while clearing their original positions. The goal is to reconstruct a "complete" or "intended" grid where small elements are positioned logically relative to larger structures, following rules like alignment to averages, adjacency, and space availability.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood-fill to group same-color cells.
 * Small components are defined strictly as <8 cells AND not touching any border (top, bottom, left, right); border-touching or large (>=8) components stay in place.
 * Relocation prioritizes attachment to the "best" adjacent large component (measured by adjacency count, with ties broken by color value); if no adjacent large, treat as a "banner" placed vertically from the top border, centered on its average column, with fallback to nearby columns if blocked.
 * For attachments: Prefer vertical if small component's average column aligns closely with large's; otherwise, horizontal extension to the side (left/right based on relative average columns), placed in the row of the large's edge that minimizes distance to small's average row; fallback to vertical above the large if horizontal fails.
 * Placement must fit empty spaces (0s) without overlap; use exact length/height of the small component's bounding box (span in rows/cols), not just cell count.
 * Grouping: Multiple small components of the same color may be unioned if they share the same anchor large color; place the union as a single shape, preserving relative positions? (code unions positions but places as a straight line—potential issue).
 * Sorting for placement: Process groups by anchor color (None/banners last), then small color, to establish priority (e.g., lower anchor colors first).
 * Subtleties: Average positions (row/col) guide placement but are rounded; handle edge cases like out-of-bounds, no space (skip placement), or multi-row/col spans; banners start exactly from row 0 and match the small's row span height.
 * Clear original small positions to 0 before any placements to avoid overlaps.
 * Potential misses: Horizontal placements should preserve the small's row span if multi-row, but code seems to place in a single row—may flatten shapes; vertical banners assume straight vertical but use the small's row span; doesn't handle diagonal or non-straight shapes well (places as lines).
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 is empty; grid sizes vary (e.g., 10x10 in train2, 12x13? in test).

(Unions multiple small comps per group/color; but note: preserves positions, yet placement code treats as span—may need adjustment for shape.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies and relocates small non-border components in training examples 1 and 3, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction, small/large separation, and basic attachment/banner rules.
 * Failed in training example 2: Generated output keeps some small 3's in place incorrectly (e.g., scattered 3's in rows 4-8) instead of relocating; places 9 as a partial vertical in col 2 (rows 0-2) but misses expected vertical in col 2 rows 0-2 plus horizontal-ish in row 2 col 7; places 6's vertically in col 7 rows 0-2 and scattered, but expected has 6's as a horizontal extension in rows 4-5 cols 6-8 with diagonal elements—code's line-based placement doesn't handle non-straight or multi-row horizontal shapes.
 * What worked: Banner placement for isolated smalls (e.g., vertical from top); adjacency-based grouping and best-anchor selection; clearing originals; fallback deltas for placement.
 * What didn't: Horizontal placement assumes single-row line at a specific large edge row, but expected often needs multi-row or shaped placements (e.g., 6's span multiple rows/cols); vertical fallback only above large, may miss below/sides; unioning smalls but placing as straight lines flattens shapes; no handling for smalls adjacent to multiple larges or complex fits; sorting prioritizes low anchors first, but may need per-color order.
 * Function `get_union_positions` is helpful but incomplete—unions positions without preserving relative offsets for non-rectangular shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided seem relevant, though placement logic in `program` needs refinement for shape preservation.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is incomplete in the prompt (shows only 12 rows, but placements seem partial: e.g., small 4 at row1 col7 stays? but should be relocated; small 2's in rows 2-5 cols5-10 look like a banner or attachment but may not align properly to large 9/7/8 structures on left/bottom).
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected likely relocates isolated smalls like the single 4 (row1 col7) as a vertical banner from top in its avg col (~7); small vertical 2's (row3 col11, row5 col11) as attachments to the horizontal 2 banner (rows2/5 cols5-9) or large 8's (cols9-11 rows7-11); but generated keeps originals and adds nothing visible in output snippet—suggests skipping placements due to no space or wrong anchors (e.g., 2's may group under wrong large like 9).
 * Missing relocations for 7's small clump (rows9-11 cols2-3) which touches? no, internal—should attach horizontally to left of 9's or vertically above; output shows no changes there.
 * The 9's large (rows7-11 cols1-4) and 8's vertical (rows7-11 col9-11?) seem untouched (correct), but small 2's and 4 not placed as extensions (e.g., 2's might extend the top 2 banner rightward).
 * Overall, test output appears to have done little relocation (mostly originals + some 0s), differing from train2 errors by under-placing rather than mis-placing; likely fails due to same issues: poor horizontal/multi-row handling and anchor selection for scattered smalls.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle involving colored cells where the goal is to reorganize small connected components (blobs) of the same color by moving them to attach horizontally to adjacent large structures (large blobs defined by size or border touch), while preserving the overall structure of large blobs; if horizontal attachment fails, small blobs are stacked vertically in a simplified manner. The puzzle emphasizes connectivity, adjacency to different-color large blobs, and precise placement to avoid overlaps or distortions.

**Details, subtleties, key elements, key considerations:**
 * Connected components use 8-directional neighborhood (including diagonals) for blob detection, which is crucial for identifying touching but not purely orthogonal groups.
 * Large components are those with 8+ cells or any cell touching the grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else.
 * "Dynamic" small components are only those adjacent (8-dir) to a large component of a different color; non-adjacent smalls stay in place.
 * Small components are grouped by their "best" adjacent large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by color ID), and entire groups try to attach horizontally to that large blob, aligned by average row position and placed to the left or right based on average column (extending from the large's edge without overlap).
 * Horizontal placement must fit exactly in a single row (using the span of the union of the group), preferring the closest row to the group's average row among the large's edge rows; if no fit, the group fails and goes to vertical stacking.
 * Vertical stacking for failed groups: Clusters same-color failed groups by average column (merging if within 3 units), then places each cluster union as a vertical stack starting from the top (current_top), centered at rounded average column, with height based on max row span in the cluster, filling one column per cluster— but this seems overly simplistic and ignores original shapes.
 * Preserve original grid for large/static parts; clear and replace only dynamic smalls; avoid overwriting any cells (including other smalls or larges).
 * Subtle: Union of group positions for span calculation ignores duplicates but treats as merged shape; average positions guide but don't enforce shape preservation (e.g., multi-row groups place in single row horizontally).
 * Easy to miss: Border-touching defines "large" even if small size (e.g., a single border cell is large); adjacency counts only to different-color larges; stacking uses a global current_top starting at 0, potentially overwriting top rows if not careful (though code checks bounds).
 * Colors are positive integers; empty cells are 0; output must be exact grid match, including positions and no extra fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle cases where small groups have vertical span but horizontal place flattens them; stacking may need to respect original multi-column shapes better; failed placements shouldn't scatter but consolidate; test for overlaps in stacking (code has basic check but may fail if place_col occupied).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt correctly handled training example 1 and 3, successfully identifying dynamic small components, grouping them by best large neighbor, and placing them horizontally adjacent without overlaps, preserving large structures.
 * Failed training example 2: Generated output placed a single 9 at [0][7] (top row, near right), left 9's at [6][5] and [6][6] uncleared/in place, and kept other smalls like 3's and 6's as original; expected clears those bottom 9's, moves them to form a vertical-ish group of three 9's in column 2 (rows 0-2) plus one at [2][7], suggesting the code failed to group or stack the 9's properly after horizontal attempt failed, instead scattering or not moving them fully.
 * What worked: Component detection (8-connect), large/small classification, dynamic identification via adjacency, basic horizontal placement (worked in 1 and 3), and union/span calcs for group fitting.
 * What didn't: In example 2, horizontal placement for 9's (adjacent to large 3?) likely failed due to edge row mismatch or span fit issue, then vertical stacking clustered incorrectly (placed one 9 high up instead of grouping all), and didn't clear original positions fully; also, used_comp_ids tracking missed some ungrouped dynamics, leaving remnants.
 * get_small_groups correctly finds best large via adj count but may tiebreak poorly (min by (-count, color) favors low colors); try_horizontal_place assumes single-row flatten for multi-row groups, which may not match expected shapes (e.g., expected 9's keep some verticality).
 * Vertical stacking logic is broken/unhelpful: It merges clusters by col avg <=3, places in one column (losing width), starts from top=0 (risking overlap with existing top content), and only fills if empty—but in example 2, it placed wrongly and incompletely; don't rely on current_top or single-col placement, as it distorts shapes.
 * get_dynamic_colors and get_union_pos are helpful for isolating movers and merging, but failed_clusters accumulation misses some ungrouped smalls.
 * Overall, core component extraction and horizontal logic works for simple cases (1 and 3), but stacking for complex/multi-failed groups is inadequate, leading to partial moves or artifacts.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears partially correct but likely incomplete or distorted: It moved some 2's to form horizontal/vertical lines in rows 2-5 cols 6-10 and scattered singles, which may align with attaching to a large 2 (but input has 2's already connected, so unclear if over-moved); 9's are consolidated leftward (rows 7-11 cols 1-4), 7's in [9-11][2-3], 8's scattered right (rows 7-11 cols 9-12), suggesting dynamic smalls (7,8,9 adjacent to larges?) were grouped/stacked, but placements seem vertically stacked in few columns, potentially losing original shapes (e.g., 9's were L-ish, now more blocky).
 * Does not look fully correct: No horizontal attachments visible (e.g., 9's not snug to any large edge; 8's not aligned to 9/7); stacking starts low (row 7) instead of top, avoiding overlap but ignoring "top-down" intent; 2's movement adds extras like [2][11-12] which weren't in input, implying faulty union or over-placement; compared to rules, if 2's are large (border-touch? input row 0/1 has 2's at col8, so yes), small 7/8/9 should attach horizontally first (e.g., 8's near 9's edge), but instead stacked vertically—mismatches expected precise adjacency.
 * Subtleties missed in test: Possible no large for some smalls (e.g., isolated 8's?), leading to no move, but output did move them; flattening multi-row smalls (like 9's span) into stacks ignores shape, likely wrong if puzzle wants preserved connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells where connected components of the same color are identified and classified as static/large (if color 3 or 4, size >=8, or touching the border) or small/movable (otherwise). Small components are removed and then repositioned either by attaching them as horizontal or vertical banners to the edges of adjacent large components (preferring orientation based on their shape) or, if unplaced, as vertical banners sorted by average column position at the top of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so use Moore neighborhood for flood fill to find connected groups.
 * Static/large components stay in place; small ones are erased first, then placed without overlapping anything.
 * For attachment: Prefer horizontal placement if the small component spans more columns than rows (or equal, default to horizontal); vertical otherwise. Align to the edge of the large component (left/right or top/bottom) based on average positions, using candidate rows/columns from the anchor's edge, sorted by proximity to the small's average.
 * For vertical attachment, if the preferred side (above/below based on averages) fails due to space or overlap, try the opposite side.
 * Unplaced smalls form "banner groups" unioned by best anchor color; if no anchor, treat as free-floating. Place free or unattachable groups as vertical banners at the top, starting from a height based on the max length of such groups, centered roughly on their average column (with delta trials for fitting).
 * Subtlety: Banners must fit exactly in free space (all zeros) without partial overlaps; length is based on distinct rows/cols in the union. Sorting banners by average column ensures left-to-right order.
 * Edge cases: Empty components return defaults (e.g., avg 0); ensure bounds checking for placements. Groups with same anchor and color are unioned before placement.
 * When placing banners at top, the start row is max_h - length, but max_h is max distinct rows of banners—ensures they stack without overlap, but may clip if too tall (though grids seem to fit).
 * Adjacency for anchoring counts neighboring large cells (8-dir) to choose best anchor by max touches; only anchor if large and >0 touches.
 * Potential miss: In vertical placement fallback, the code has a nested loop that breaks correctly only if placed, but may skip some candidates if outer loop breaks prematurely.
 * All placements use the original small color; no color changes.

(Helpful for classifying border-touching components as static/large.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for comp in comps:
        for p in comp:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(Useful for merging positions of grouped small components before computing averages or shapes.)

```python
def compute_average_row(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in positions) / n

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n

def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)
```
(These are helpful for determining placement sides (e.g., avg positions for left/right) and bounds for edge alignment; min/max useful for edge refs.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles component extraction and classification (static if color 3/4, size >=8, or border-touching; smalls otherwise), as evidenced by training 1 and 3 passing fully.
 * Training 1 correct: All smalls placed properly, likely attached or as banners matching expected.
 * Training 2 incorrect: Generated output places two 9s horizontally at top-left (rows 0-2, cols 2-2 but duplicated), and 6s incorrectly (one at row2 col7, others scattered at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8) instead of expected (9s vertical at col2 rows0-2 and one at row2 col7; 6s more integrated at row3 col7, row4 col6/8, row5 col6/8 but with an extra at row2 col7 as 9? Wait, expected has 9 at row2 col7, 6s starting row3 col7 downward rightward—mismatch in 6 placement positions and missing integration; unknown why horizontal preference failed for 9s or why 6s didn't attach vertically to 3s properly).
 * Training 3 correct: Placements matched, suggesting vertical/horizontal logic works for some shapes/anchors.
 * Attempt groups smalls by best anchor (max adjacent large color), unions them, and prefers orientation (horizontal if wider), but in training 2, this led to misplacement of 9s (treated as horizontal banner?) and 6s (partial attachment but wrong side/position).
 * Banner fallback at top sorts by avg col and trials deltas/signs for fitting, but in training 2, it placed 9s too clustered/left without proper vertical stacking, and 6s overlapped or ignored anchor.
 * The vertical placement fallback (trying opposite side) is included but buggy in training 2—code has nested loops that may not fully explore candidates, leading to unplaced 6s defaulting incorrectly.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (e.g., neighbors, components) are relevant, though the main program logic needs tuning for side selection and candidate sorting.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 2s in a scattered way (e.g., top rows have 2s at col10-11 row0, col7/10 row1, dense row2 cols5-9, row3 col10, row4 cols5-9) which seems like partial re-placement of a large 2 blob, but likely incorrect as it doesn't erase and reattach smalls properly—appears to leave some original positions or fail unioning, resulting in non-contiguous banners; expected should erase small 2s/others, attach to large 4 (at row3 cols6-8?) perhaps vertically below, and place 9/7/8 as banners or attachments to borders/statics, but output has 9s/7s/8s mostly original with no clear movement (e.g., 9s at rows7-11 cols1-4/8, 7s row9-11 col2-3, 8s row7-11 col9-11)—no top banners visible, suggesting attachment logic failed for most smalls, leaving grid almost unchanged except top 2s messed up; this does not make sense as smalls like isolated 9s/7s/8 should move/attach, and 2s should form clean banners.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where small, disconnected components (blobs) of the same color need to be identified, detached, and reattached to their corresponding larger "parent" components to complete or reassemble shapes, likely simulating puzzle piece attachment without overlapping or going out of bounds. The goal is to produce a modified grid where small blobs are cleared from their original positions and placed adjacent to the large blobs, prioritizing spatial logic like alignment, adjacency, and orientation (horizontal/vertical).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Use 8-connected neighborhood for defining connected components (diagonal counts as connected), but ensure no merging of different colors.
 * Small components are strictly those with size < 8 cells that do not touch the grid border (to distinguish "floating" pieces from structural elements).
 * Attachment prioritizes the largest adjacent color (or same color if applicable), but only if the large component is bigger than the small one; avoid self-attachment unless necessary.
 * Placement logic must consider the large component's bounding box (height/width), average positions, and row/column spans to decide vertical vs. horizontal attachment; prefer extending from the "extreme" edge (min/max row/col) closest to the small component's average position.
 * Clearing: Always erase the original small component positions before placing to avoid duplicates or overlaps.
 * Fitting check: Ensure the placement area is empty (0) and within bounds; if horizontal placement fails, fall back to vertical at a rounded average column near the large component.
 * Subtlety: Row span determines "length" for linear placement (e.g., vertical if large is taller); average row/col for small helps proximity, but use min/max for large's extremes to avoid centering inside the shape.
 * Edge cases: Empty components or no large parent should skip; multiple smalls can group to one large; total size per color includes all components to compare small vs. large.
 * Avoid over-attachment: Only attach if adjacency exists or same color; don't place if no fit found (leave as 0? but code forces some placement).
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x13 in test), so dynamic rows/cols handling is key; preserve non-zero cells unless they are small components being moved.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import math

def get_neighbors(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This defines 8-connectivity, essential for component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This DFS-based component extraction is core and correct; groups positions per color/component, vital for identifying small/large blobs.)

```python
def identify_small_components(components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]], rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    small: List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]], List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = []
    for color, comps in components.items():
        for comp in comps:
            size = len(comp)
            touches_border = any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)
            if size < 8 and not touches_border:
                small.append((color, comp, comp))
    return small
```
(This correctly filters small, internal components; the triple tuple is redundant but harmless—could simplify to (color, positions).)

```python
def compute_row_span(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    return len(set(r for r, _ in positions))

def compute_average_col(positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(positions)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in positions) / n
```
(These help with placement metrics like span for length and averages for proximity; row_span assumes vertical linearity, which may miss horizontal smalls.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission; it successfully handled all three training examples, correctly identifying and reattaching small components to large ones using adjacency and spatial rules.
 * What worked: Connected component detection via DFS/stack is robust and handles multi-component colors well; small component filtering (<8, no border) matches puzzle's "detached pieces"; grouping by adjacency to largest neighbor works for simple attachments; placement fallback from horizontal to vertical ensures something is tried.
 * What didn't work: In build_groups, self-attachment (best_l = color) only triggers if no adjacents and total_size > current, but may over-attach unrelated smalls; placement logic assumes linear (row_span as length), which fails for non-linear small shapes (e.g., L-shapes); in non-vertical case, extreme_rows fallback to all rows if no extreme col matches, but min(key=abs(rr - avg_row_s)) may pick suboptimal row; no handling for multiple placements per large or overlapping groups; union_pos for multiple smalls assumes they merge, but code places each group's union as linear, potentially distorting shapes.
 * compute_average_col and row_span are helpful but incomplete—add col_span and average_row for better symmetry; get_union_positions correctly merges positions without duplicates.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this code demonstrates core understanding (components, attachment) while missing shape preservation (places as lines, not original form).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a partially processed 12x13 grid with persistent large structures (e.g., color 9 in cols 1-4, rows 7-11; color 7 in row 9-11 col 2-3; color 8 scattered in col 10-11) and some small 2's cleared/relocated (e.g., original 2's in rows 2-5 cols 5-10 seem mostly erased, with singles in row 1 col 7, row 3 col 10, row 5 col 10, row 7-10 col 10).
 * It does not look fully correct: Small 2's appear to be placed as singles vertically in col 10 (rows 3,5,7,9?), but the original small 2's were horizontal bars (e.g., row 2: single at col7; rows 2-5 have bar-like in cols5-9 for row2? wait, input not shown but inferred); this linear placement ignores the bar shape, resulting in dotted line instead of reattached bar—expected to preserve or extend the horizontal 2-bar adjacent to a large 2 (possibly the single in row1 or implied). Color 9 and 7 seem untouched (not small), but 8's are scattered without clear attachment (e.g., row7 col9=8, row8 col10=8, etc.), suggesting no small 8's were moved or grouping failed. Overall, output has too many isolated 0's and incomplete attachments (e.g., 2's not fully reassembled into a shape), differing from expected complete shapes; unknown why 2's went to col10 specifically (perhaps avg_col_l targeting), but it mismatches horizontal nature.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers represent colors) where the goal is to identify and manipulate disconnected "small" components of the same color by moving them to attach adjacently to "fixed" larger or border-touching components, potentially of different colors, to reassemble or complete coherent shapes or patterns while clearing their original positions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Components are defined using 8-directional connectivity (Moore neighborhood), so diagonal touches count as connected.
 * Fixed components are those with size >=8 cells or any cell touching the grid border; these cannot be moved and serve as anchors.
 * Small components (size <8 and not touching border) of the same color are grouped based on their adjacency to fixed components of other colors, prioritizing the most adjacent fixed color as an "anchor."
 * Placement prefers horizontal attachment to the side of the anchor (right if small comp's avg col < anchor's, left otherwise), using the row closest to the small comp's average row among the anchor's extreme column cells; fallback to vertical (above anchor) or even free vertical placement in a column if horizontal fails.
 * Union positions are used when multiple small comps group to the same anchor, treating them as a single block to place (size = total unique cells).
 * Original positions of moved small comps are cleared to 0.
 * Subtlety: Adjacency for grouping counts only if the neighboring cell is in a fixed set of that color, avoiding false attachments to other small comps.
 * Edge cases: Empty groups or anchors skip placement; placement checks for empty cells only; vertical fallback may place partially (min(size, available space)) or scatter in a column if unspecified.
 * Potential miss: The code assumes linear placement (straight line horizontal/vertical), but puzzles might require non-linear or curved attachments to match shapes.
 * Border touching is strict (any cell on row 0/rows-1 or col 0/cols-1).
 * Averages (row/col) guide target positions but are rounded or minimized by distance, which may not always align perfectly with puzzle symmetry.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; prior iterations are not shown, but the code builds on component detection and placement logic.
 * What worked: Successfully identifies and fixes large/border components, groups small ones by adjacency counts to anchors, and places them in linear fashion (horizontal preferred based on spans); all three training examples passed, indicating core logic handles simple cases well (e.g., basic attachments without complex overlaps or multiple groups).
 * What didn't work: Placement may fail or misplace in cases with multiple anchors or non-linear needs, as vertical fallback is incomplete (e.g., places above anchor but not below/right in all directions); unioning small comps treats them as blocks but places linearly, potentially distorting original shapes.
 * Adjacency counting only considers fixed sets, which is helpful for avoiding premature grouping but may miss subtle connections if small comps are adjacent to non-fixed parts.
 * The `program` function's placement loop tries horizontal first (based on anchor span preference), then vertical, but skips some directions (e.g., no below-anchor vertical), leading to partial placements.
 * No handling for same-color anchors or intra-color movements; assumes cross-color attachments.
 * Copy.deepcopy for new_g is efficient but may be unnecessary if in-place mods are safe post-clearing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 12x13 grid with cleared positions (many 0s) and relocated 2's (e.g., horizontal lines of five 2's in rows 2 and 4, single 2's scattered in rows 3,5,6,7,9), plus unchanged 4's at top, and 7,8,9 structures at bottom-left/mid-right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output likely involves attaching small 2's (e.g., the scattered singles and partial lines) more cohesively to form complete shapes, such as extending existing 2 structures (visible horizontal bars in input) into symmetric or filled blobs, but the output scatters them vertically in column 9 (e.g., 2's at (3,10)? wait, formatting shows irregular placement like (9,7)=2 isolated), which fragments rather than unites; original input has 2's in rows 2-6 cols 5-10ish and singles, but output clears some and places linearly without matching input shapes.
 * Difference: Input has clustered 2's (e.g., row2: five 2's cols5-9, row4 similar) and small detached 2's (e.g., row3 col10, row5 col9, row6 col9?); output preserves some but moves others to top-right (rows0-1 col7=4? no, 4's are separate) and vertical in col9/10, but fails to attach to main 2 body or other anchors like 8/9, resulting in disconnected remnants instead of integrated (e.g., no extension of the 2 bars downward).
 * Subtle issue: The 7's and 9's in bottom-left seem untouched (fixed as border/large?), but small 8's and 2's are partially moved without clear adjacency to anchors, suggesting grouping/adjacency logic missed best anchor (e.g., 2's near 8 in row9 col11? but placed elsewhere).
 * Overall, output partially reassembles (some 2 lines intact) but leaves fragments, differing from expected complete attachments; unknown if puzzle requires exact shape preservation or just proximity, but scattering indicates misalignment.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:52:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based connected components (blobs) of colored numbers, where small, movable components (not large and adjacent to large ones) are identified, removed from their original positions, and re-placed by attaching them horizontally or vertically to "anchor" large components of different colors, with preferences for orientation and positioning based on averages and spans; if attachment fails, they are placed as "banners" in designated rows or columns. The goal is to reorganize the grid to form more compact or logically attached shapes while clearing original small component spaces, likely simulating a "blob merging" or "puzzle assembly" mechanic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 8-connected (including diagonals), so neighbors include all 8 directions; this affects how components are grouped and adjacency is detected.
 * "Large" components are defined as those with size >=8 cells OR touching any grid border (row 0, row rows-1, col 0, col cols-1); small components are everything else, but only "movable" smalls are those adjacent (8-dir) to at least one large cell of a different color.
 * Movable smalls are grouped by their "best anchor" large color (the one with most adjacent cells, tiebroken by lowest color ID); unions of same-color smalls sharing the same anchor are treated as a single unit for placement.
 * Placement prioritizes horizontal attachment to the anchor's edge (preferring the side opposite the small's average column position relative to anchor's average, and trying candidate rows sorted by proximity to small's average row); if horizontal fails or not preferred (e.g., if vertically embedded or row span > col span), try vertical attachment similarly (opposite side based on average rows, candidate cols sorted by proximity to average col).
 * If attachment fails, smalls become "banners": grouped by color, placed horizontally or vertically in a "banner row" (often row = max vertical span -1 for that color, or row 0 fallback), centered on average column, preferring horizontal if col span >= row span; vertical banners align to bottom at banner row, starting from top if space-constrained.
 * Subtleties: Horizontal embedding check (if small already has anchor on both left and right sides) skips horizontal preference; placements must be in empty cells (0s) without overlap; vertical placements track max span per color for banner row calculation; borders and out-of-bounds are strictly checked; unions of multiple small comps per color/anchor must preserve relative shape? (but code flattens to bounding box spans, which may lose shape fidelity).
 * Easy-to-miss: Anchors are only large components of different color; same-color smalls aren't movable to their own large; removals happen before all placements, so no overlap with originals; banner placements don't attach to anything, just fill space; grid is list of lists, colors are positive ints, 0 is empty.
 * Considerations across attempts: Preserve exact positions in placements? (code uses bounding box spans, but places as solid blocks, potentially distorting shapes); handle multiple groups per anchor/color; vertical spans influence banner rows globally per color; prefer "opposite" sides for attachments to avoid overlap; candidate lines (rows/cols) must have anchor presence for adjacency.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set
import copy

def get_neighbors8(r: int, c: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    return [(r + dr, c + dc) for dr, dc in dirs if 0 <= r + dr < rows and 0 <= c + dc < cols]
```
(This is helpful for 8-connected adjacency and component finding.)

```python
def find_components(g: List[List[int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    components: Dict[int, List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]] = defaultdict(list)
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if g[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:
                color = g[r][c]
                component: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
                stack: List[Tuple[int, int]] = [(r, c)]
                visited[r][c] = True
                while stack:
                    cr, cc = stack.pop()
                    component.append((cr, cc))
                    for nr, nc in get_neighbors8(cr, cc, rows, cols):
                        if g[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:
                            visited[nr][nc] = True
                            stack.append((nr, nc))
                components[color].append(component)
    return components
```
(This is essential for extracting all connected components per color, enabling large/small classification and movables identification.)

```python
def touches_border(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return any(r == 0 or r == rows - 1 or c == 0 or c == cols - 1 for r, c in comp)

def is_large_component(comp: List[Tuple[int, int]], rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    return len(comp) >= 8 or touches_border(comp, rows, cols)
```
(These are helpful for classifying components as large, which drives movability and anchoring.)

```python
def compute_min_max(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    if not pos:
        return 0, 0, 0, 0
    rs = [r for r, _ in pos]
    cs = [c for _, c in pos]
    return min(rs), max(rs), min(cs), max(cs)

def compute_average_row(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(r for r, _ in pos) / n

def compute_average_col(pos: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> float:
    n = len(pos)
    if n == 0:
        return 0.0
    return sum(c for _, c in pos) / n
```
(These are useful for bounding boxes, spans, and average positions to guide placement candidates and preferences.)

```python
def get_union_positions(comps: List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    seen = set()
    union = []
    for pos_list in comps:
        for p in pos_list:
            tp = (p[0], p[1])
            if tp not in seen:
                seen.add(tp)
                union.append(p)
    return union
```
(This helps merge positions from multiple small components sharing an anchor, though it may not preserve disconnected shapes.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful to the puzzle (don't use in future attempts):
- `is_horizontally_embedded`: Overly simplistic (only checks direct left/right per cell, misses diagonal or partial embedding; led to wrong preferences in train1/2).
- `try_horizontal_placement` and `try_vertical_placement`: Place as solid bounding box blocks instead of preserving original relative positions/shapes, causing distortions (e.g., train1 6's placed as singles instead of pair); candidate selection too rigid (only exact edge cols/rows with anchor presence, misses nearby lines); "opposite" side logic fails when averages align closely.
- `place_banner_groups`: Assumes solid block placement without shape preservation; banner row calculation (max_vs -1) is arbitrary and doesn't match expected positions (e.g., train1 7's at top instead of mid-bottom); vertical fallback ignores col centering properly.
- `identify_movable_smalls`: Correctly IDs adjacencies but skips if any part of small touches large of same color? (subtle bug: checks d_color != color but not explicitly same-color large exclusion).
- `compute_best_anchors`: Good for grouping, but tiebreak by -d (lowest color) may not match puzzle intent (unknown preference).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies components, classifies large/small, finds movables adjacent to large anchors, removes smalls, and attempts attachments or banners, demonstrating core understanding of component extraction and movement rules; it passed training example 3 fully, showing it handles some vertical/horizontal attachments and banner fallbacks correctly.
 * Missed preserving the exact shape/relative positions of small components during placement—instead uses bounding box spans to place solid blocks, leading to shape distortions (e.g., in train1, the pair of 6's in row3 col7-8 expected is placed as scattered singles; in train2, the single 9 is placed in row5 col7 instead of row2 col7 attached to the vertical 9's).
 * In train1 (INCORRECT): Generated keeps some smalls in place (e.g., 6 at row2 col0, 6's at row5-6 col2) instead of moving them; places 7's as horizontal banner at row0 col5-6 (wrong position/orientation); 3's layout partially mangled at bottom; differs from expected by not attaching 6's horizontally to 4's in row3 col7-8, not moving 7's to attach left of 3's in row10 col1-2, and leaving row0/5/6 cluttered instead of clearing to all 0s.
 * In train2 (INCORRECT): Generated places an extra 9 at row5 col7 (likely a misplaced banner or wrong vertical attachment), but expected attaches it horizontally/vertically to the main 9's at row2 col7 without extras; 6's and 3's seem untouched correctly, but 9 handling fails—unknown why it didn't detect the small 9 as movable to the large vertical 9's (perhaps same-color anchor exclusion bug or embedding check).
 * In train3 (CORRECT): All elements handled properly—smalls moved/attached or bannered without distortion, clearances correct, suggesting the code works for cases with clear opposite-side attachments and no shape complexity.
 * extract_objects equivalent (find_components) is essential for all steps; union_positions helpful for merging but loses shape info, contributing to errors.
 * Overall, attachment logic (horizontal/vertical try) too greedy/rigid, failing when candidates don't have direct anchor on edge line (e.g., train1 6's need offset row); banner placement ignores puzzle-specific rows (e.g., prefers top but expected mid/bottom); no handling for same-color attachments or non-bounding-box shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partially cleared and re-placed grid, but with suspicious placements: e.g., 2's form irregular shapes across rows 2-5 and 9-10 (possibly unioned smalls placed as blocks, distorting original connectivity); isolated 4 at row5 col7, 9's scattered in rows6-11 cols3-4 (looks like failed vertical attachment to something); 8's vertical in col10 rows7-12 but with gaps; 7's pair at row9 col2-3 embedded oddly. This doesn't make sense as a clean attachment/banner result—many smalls seem not fully moved (e.g., original 2's at row4 col10 and row9 col7-8 still present?), and placements overlap or ignore empties (e.g., row10 col7 has 2 next to 0's). It differs from expected (mentally: small 9's/7's/8's should attach to large 2's horizontally in row3/4 extensions or vertically in col5/10; 4 as small banner low; clears should make top/mid more empty). Likely wrong due to same issues as train1/2: shape distortion, wrong candidate lines, banner rows misplaced (e.g., 9's not centralized). To handle test, must preserve shapes (place relative offsets, not blocks), relax candidate selection to nearby lines, and tune banner rows to bottom/mid based on large spans.
