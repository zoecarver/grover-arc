=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:29:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:43:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (likely representing an architectural or patterned design like bays between walls in a structure) where three colors are used: border/wall color (b), background/fill color (g_color), and special/accent color (s). The task is to complete a partial grid by identifying wall positions along the width, extracting patterns from filled "bays" (sections between walls) in each row, selecting an appropriate pattern (e.g., via majority vote or prioritizing unique ones with s), and applying it to unfilled or inconsistent bays to produce a coherent, symmetric, or structured output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is partial, with some cells filled and others empty (likely represented by 0 or another sentinel value not handled in the code; all cells are treated as filled, leading to copying instead of completion).
 * Walls are always at positions 0 and width-1 (borders), with additional interior walls placed at regular intervals: k = (width - 1) // 6 interior groups, step = (width - 1) // k, walls = [i * step for i in range(k + 1)]; this creates multiple bays per row for larger widths (e.g., 1 bay for width=7, but more for width=8+), but for small widths like 7, it's effectively one bay of length 5.
 * Bays are the slices between walls (exclusive), e.g., for width=7, walls=[0,6], bay=row[1:6]; patterns must be extracted per bay, ignoring or handling empty/partial bays (all empty or containing unfilled cells).
 * Pattern selection per row: Use filled bays to determine a "canonical" pattern—prefer the unique (count=1) pattern containing s if present, else the majority (most common) pattern; empty bays should be filled with the chosen pattern, not copied as-is.
 * The grid may consist of multiple vertical blocks (e.g., 3 blocks of 7 rows in training examples, separated by all-b rows), where patterns propagate or vary slightly across blocks but maintain structural consistency (e.g., forming shapes like paths or figures with s inside g background).
 * Subtlety: Patterns are row-specific but must align vertically for coherence (e.g., s placements form connected shapes across rows); the code ignores vertical context, treating rows independently.
 * Colors are identified from top-left (b), near-diagonal (g_color), and any differing cell (s); assumes exactly three colors, no validation if more/fewer.
 * Output always adds b borders around chosen pattern, assuming square grid, but height may exceed width (e.g., 19x7 for train1).
 * Easy to miss: For single-bay rows (common in small grids), if partial, need intra-bay filling (e.g., extend majority color or mirror), but code doesn't handle; multiple bays require cross-bay inference, but code extracts all slices without checking filled status.
 * Vertical blocks share all-b rows (e.g., rows 1,7,13,19 are all b), and inner blocks (rows 2-6,8-12,14-18) have varying but related patterns (e.g., in train1, block 1 has centered s at row4, block 2 shifted right, block 3 mixed).
 * No handling for non-square grids or varying row lengths; assumes all rows same length.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program uses height (len(g)) instead of width (len(g[0])) for get_wall_positions, causing wrong walls for non-square/tall grids (e.g., 19x7 train1: walls=[0,6,12,18], but width=7 leads to mostly empty patterns after first bay, coincidentally copying inner [1:6] but failing multi-bay logic).
 * Copies partial bay patterns without filling empties or partials, leading to output matching input inners (with borders added), but expected has filled/completed shapes (e.g., in train1, likely input had missing 4's/s=4? Wait, in train1 s=4, g=6, b=1; generated matches expected in most spots but said INCORRECT—possible minor diff in unlisted row or because no filling occurred for partial input).
 * In train1 (likely 19x7 partial input): Generated nearly matches expected (e.g., row3 [1,6,4,6,4,6,1] correct, row10 [1,6,4,4,6,6,1] correct, row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] correct), but INCORRECT overall—subtle diffs possible in s placements (e.g., generated row17 [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but perhaps input partiality not filled, or vertical inconsistency); what worked: border addition and single-bay copy for filled rows; didn't work: no filling for partial bays, wrong walls for tall grid (but coincidentally ok for width=7).
 * In train2 (likely similar 19x7, b=3, g=4, s=1): Clear mismatches in third block—generated row15 [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] (pattern [4,1,1,1,4]) vs expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] ([4,1,1,4,4]); row16 [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] ([4,4,1,4,4]) vs expected [3,4,4,1,1,4,3] ([4,4,1,1,4]); row17 matches [3,4,1,1,4,4,3]; what worked: first two blocks copy correctly (e.g., row3 [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches), color ID, border handling; didn't work: choose_pattern picked wrong variant in third block (likely majority [1,1,1] over [1,1,4] due to partial input bays misinterpreted, or no vertical propagation); subtle: patterns shift right/down across blocks, requiring block-aware logic.
 * extract_objects not present, but bay extraction (get_bay_patterns) is essential for multi-bay, though broken by wrong walls and no empty detection.
 * choose_pattern is partially helpful but flawed (prefers s-containing odd-one-out, but in train2 row15/16, likely multiple partials led to wrong majority; doesn't filter empties, causing bias; unhelpful for single-bay partials as it returns unchanged slice).
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of colors/bays/pattern selection but fails on partial filling, wrong n=height vs width, and no vertical/block context—leads to copy-like output instead of completion.
 * No unhelpful functions beyond the main program (which is broken for non-square and partials; don't reuse without fixes like width-based walls and empty-bay filling via replication).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to be a partial copy with borders added (b=4, g=8?, s=1), producing irregular, non-coherent patterns across ~29 rows x 8 cols (likely 4 blocks of ~7-8 rows), e.g., row3 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8,4] (pattern [8,1,8,8,1,8] alternating s), row4 [4,8,1,1,1,1,8,4] (all s in middle), row5 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8,4] (repeat of row3?), but then row6 [4,8,1,8,1,1,8,4] inconsistent, and later row24 [4,8,1,1,8,1,8,4] scattered s without forming shapes.
 * Unlike training expected (structured figures, e.g., clustered s=1/4 in g=6/4 background, symmetric/shifted per block), test generated lacks vertical alignment (s don't connect into paths/letters), has redundant repeats (e.g., rows 3/5/11/15/18/20 similar but not exact), and empty-ish bays not filled (suggests input partials copied, not completed via majority/s-rule).
 * For width=8 (k=1, single bay len6 if fixed), should fill partial bay consistently per row/block, but output varies wildly without structure—likely due to copying input partials independently per row, ignoring bay filling or block patterns; to handle test, need width-based walls, detect empties (e.g., count non-g/s cells), fill with majority from "valid" bays, and ensure vertical coherence (e.g., match patterns to nearest filled block).
