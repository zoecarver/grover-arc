=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 19:51:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 19:57:07] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:03:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Finds vertical border column positions in the first non-border row of the current section."""
    frame_c = get_frame_color(g)
    r = 0
    H = len(g)
    while r < H and is_border_row(g[r], frame_c):
        r += 1
    if r == H:
        return []
    row = g[r]
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_starts_and_rights(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left-start and right-end positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0]

    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)

    frame_c = get_frame_color(g)
    r = 0
    H = len(g)
    while r < H and is_border_row(g[r], frame_c):
        r += 1
    if r == H:
        return []
    row = g[r]
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_starts_and_rights(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left-start and right-end positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:06:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row is filled with the frame color, indicating a border."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds all column indices in a row where the frame color appears (potential panel starts)."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_panel_starts(border_pos: List[int], W: int) -> List[int]:
    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

[2025-10-01 20:06:33] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-01 20:07:21] Response:
### Identified Components
Based on the provided data across all train and test inputs (and train outputs for consistency verification), the following components are consistently present and distinguishable by their properties. These are the only elements with obvious, repeated presence; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., occasional anomalous small shapes like single-pixel Maroons in test input 2 or irregular bottom-row Maroons in test input 1) are excluded as they lack consistent interactions.

- **Overall Background**: A single large enclosing shape per puzzle, characterized by high hole count (holes ≥9), large bbox covering the entire canvas (e.g., [0,0,18,18] or [0,0,24,24]), moderate-to-high pixel count (pixels ≥136), and varying color (Blue, Green, Yellow, or Blue). It fully contains all other components spatially.
- **Cell Backgrounds**: Multiple medium-sized shapes (typically 3–4 per input, arranged in a vertical stack or partial grid), each with exactly holes=1, bbox spanning ~4–6 units in both dimensions (e.g., [1,1,5,5] or [1,15,6,20]), pixel count ~18–25, and varying color (Pink, Yellow, Maroon, or Green). They represent grid cells and do not overlap each other.
- **Content Shapes**: Multiple small shapes (one per cell background, totaling 3–4 per input), each with holes=0, smaller bbox fully nested inside a corresponding cell background (spanning ~2–4 units, e.g., [2,2,4,4]), low pixel count (~4–11), and varying color (Yellow, Blue, or Maroon). They appear pixelated/blocky, suggesting polyomino-like forms (e.g., L or H variants).

No other components (e.g., no consistent "frames" or "fillers" beyond these) show interactions. Semantic meanings like exact polyomino types (L-tromino, H-tetromino) are not reliably identifiable from bbox/pixels alone and are not forced here.

### Consistent Interconnections and Interactions
Only interactions that appear obviously and identically in **every** train input/output pair (and structurally in test inputs, where verifiable) are listed. These are based on properties like position (bbox coordinates), containment (bbox overlap), hole count (structural property), and transformation rules (e.g., position → selection/transformation). No high-level puzzle logic or total solutions are inferred. Interactions without 100% consistency (e.g., color changes, which vary independently; exact pixel tweaks, which are minor and inconsistent in direction) are excluded or noted as unknown. No forced explanations for unclear transformations.

1. **Hole Count → Component Classification**:
   - Hole count consistently distinguishes and groups components across all puzzles: holes=0 identifies content shapes; holes=1 identifies cell backgrounds; holes ≥9 identifies the overall background.
   - This classification is prerequisite for all other interactions (e.g., only classified components are selected or transformed). No other hole values appear consistently.

2. **Spatial Containment (Bbox Overlap) → Structural Hierarchy**:
   - Every content shape's bbox is strictly contained within exactly one cell background's bbox (e.g., content [2,2,4,4] inside cell [1,1,5,5]; no overlaps between contents or cells).
   - Every cell background's bbox (and thus all contents) is strictly contained within the overall background's bbox.
   - This hierarchy is preserved in train outputs: selected contents remain nested in their original cell backgrounds, and the transformed background still encloses them. Consistent in all inputs; no escapes or crossings.

3. **Position (Bbox min_x) → Selection for Preservation**:
   - Content shapes and cell backgrounds with low min_x (specifically min_x ≤2, indicating leftmost "column" positions, e.g., x-start ~1–2) are consistently selected and preserved in train outputs.
   - Non-left positions (min_x ≥7) are consistently excluded (no preservation or transformation).
   - Preservation includes minor, unknown adjustments (e.g., pixel count ±1; bbox max_y shift by 1 unit in some cases, like [2,14,4,16] → [2,14,4,15]), but core properties (color, holes=0 or 1, relative nesting) remain unchanged. Applies only to classified components (via hole count); irrelevant elements ignored.
   - In test inputs, leftmost positions (min_x ≤2 or equivalent scaled, e.g., [2,2,5,5] in test 1; [2,2,4,4] in test 2) follow the same low-min_x pattern, suggesting consistency.

4. **Position (Grid Layout) + Overall Background → Background Transformation**:
   - The overall background consistently transforms in train outputs based on the leftmost column's width: its bbox x-range narrows to [0,0,6,*] (y-range preserved, e.g., [0,0,6,18] from [0,0,18,18]), holes fixed to 3, pixels fixed to 58.
   - Color is preserved (e.g., Blue → Blue; Green → Green). This interacts with the positional selection above: the new bbox exactly encloses the preserved left-column components (width ~6 units to match selected cells/contents).
   - Transformation is unknown in exact mechanism (e.g., why holes=3 or pixels=58 specifically), but the position-based resizing and fixed output properties are identical in both train examples. Test inputs show similar full-canvas bboxes, implying potential for analogous transformation.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Elements**: Elements without interactions (e.g., right-column contents/cells, which are always discarded; isolated small shapes like [14,2,14,2] in test 2, which don't nest or select consistently) are ignored. No consistent interactions for colors (they vary without pattern, e.g., no color → transformation rule holds across all). No consistent edge/silhouette/hole effects on movement (e.g., pixel count varies but doesn't reliably predict changes).
- **Unknowns**: Minor pixel/bbox tweaks in preserved shapes (e.g., why pixels=5 →6 in some train 1 cases) are consistent in occurrence (always on selected left items) but unknown in cause—possibly due to position-relative adjustments, but not explainable from data. No consistent shape-specific transformations (e.g., L → H) identifiable without solving; rotations/reflections vary but don't link to other properties reliably. Grid scaling (e.g., 3x3 vs. 4x4 in tests) affects bbox sizes but not the core interactions listed.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:07:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

### Identified Components
Based on the provided data across all train and test inputs (and train outputs for consistency verification), the following components are consistently present and distinguishable by their properties. These are the only elements with obvious, repeated presence; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., occasional anomalous small shapes like single-pixel Maroons in test input 2 or irregular bottom-row Maroons in test input 1) are excluded as they lack consistent interactions.

- **Overall Background**: A single large enclosing shape per puzzle, characterized by high hole count (holes ≥9), large bbox covering the entire canvas (e.g., [0,0,18,18] or [0,0,24,24]), moderate-to-high pixel count (pixels ≥136), and varying color (Blue, Green, Yellow, or Blue). It fully contains all other components spatially.
- **Cell Backgrounds**: Multiple medium-sized shapes (typically 3–4 per input, arranged in a vertical stack or partial grid), each with exactly holes=1, bbox spanning ~4–6 units in both dimensions (e.g., [1,1,5,5] or [1,15,6,20]), pixel count ~18–25, and varying color (Pink, Yellow, Maroon, or Green). They represent grid cells and do not overlap each other.
- **Content Shapes**: Multiple small shapes (one per cell background, totaling 3–4 per input), each with holes=0, smaller bbox fully nested inside a corresponding cell background (spanning ~2–4 units, e.g., [2,2,4,4]), low pixel count (~4–11), and varying color (Yellow, Blue, or Maroon). They appear pixelated/blocky, suggesting polyomino-like forms (e.g., L or H variants).

No other components (e.g., no consistent "frames" or "fillers" beyond these) show interactions. Semantic meanings like exact polyomino types (L-tromino, H-tetromino) are not reliably identifiable from bbox/pixels alone and are not forced here.

### Consistent Interconnections and Interactions
Only interactions that appear obviously and identically in **every** train input/output pair (and structurally in test inputs, where verifiable) are listed. These are based on properties like position (bbox coordinates), containment (bbox overlap), hole count (structural property), and transformation rules (e.g., position → selection/transformation). No high-level puzzle logic or total solutions are inferred. Interactions without 100% consistency (e.g., color changes, which vary independently; exact pixel tweaks, which are minor and inconsistent in direction) are excluded or noted as unknown. No forced explanations for unclear transformations.

1. **Hole Count → Component Classification**:
   - Hole count consistently distinguishes and groups components across all puzzles: holes=0 identifies content shapes; holes=1 identifies cell backgrounds; holes ≥9 identifies the overall background.
   - This classification is prerequisite for all other interactions (e.g., only classified components are selected or transformed). No other hole values appear consistently.

2. **Spatial Containment (Bbox Overlap) → Structural Hierarchy**:
   - Every content shape's bbox is strictly contained within exactly one cell background's bbox (e.g., content [2,2,4,4] inside cell [1,1,5,5]; no overlaps between contents or cells).
   - Every cell background's bbox (and thus all contents) is strictly contained within the overall background's bbox.
   - This hierarchy is preserved in train outputs: selected contents remain nested in their original cell backgrounds, and the transformed background still encloses them. Consistent in all inputs; no escapes or crossings.

3. **Position (Bbox min_x) → Selection for Preservation**:
   - Content shapes and cell backgrounds with low min_x (specifically min_x ≤2, indicating leftmost "column" positions, e.g., x-start ~1–2) are consistently selected and preserved in train outputs.
   - Non-left positions (min_x ≥7) are consistently excluded (no preservation or transformation).
   - Preservation includes minor, unknown adjustments (e.g., pixel count ±1; bbox max_y shift by 1 unit in some cases, like [2,14,4,16] → [2,14,4,15]), but core properties (color, holes=0 or 1, relative nesting) remain unchanged. Applies only to classified components (via hole count); irrelevant elements ignored.
   - In test inputs, leftmost positions (min_x ≤2 or equivalent scaled, e.g., [2,2,5,5] in test 1; [2,2,4,4] in test 2) follow the same low-min_x pattern, suggesting consistency.

4. **Position (Grid Layout) + Overall Background → Background Transformation**:
   - The overall background consistently transforms in train outputs based on the leftmost column's width: its bbox x-range narrows to [0,0,6,*] (y-range preserved, e.g., [0,0,6,18] from [0,0,18,18]), holes fixed to 3, pixels fixed to 58.
   - Color is preserved (e.g., Blue → Blue; Green → Green). This interacts with the positional selection above: the new bbox exactly encloses the preserved left-column components (width ~6 units to match selected cells/contents).
   - Transformation is unknown in exact mechanism (e.g., why holes=3 or pixels=58 specifically), but the position-based resizing and fixed output properties are identical in both train examples. Test inputs show similar full-canvas bboxes, implying potential for analogous transformation.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **Irrelevant/Non-Consistent Elements**: Elements without interactions (e.g., right-column contents/cells, which are always discarded; isolated small shapes like [14,2,14,2] in test 2, which don't nest or select consistently) are ignored. No consistent interactions for colors (they vary without pattern, e.g., no color → transformation rule holds across all). No consistent edge/silhouette/hole effects on movement (e.g., pixel count varies but doesn't reliably predict changes).
- **Unknowns**: Minor pixel/bbox tweaks in preserved shapes (e.g., why pixels=5 →6 in some train 1 cases) are consistent in occurrence (always on selected left items) but unknown in cause—possibly due to position-relative adjustments, but not explainable from data. No consistent shape-specific transformations (e.g., L → H) identifiable without solving; rotations/reflections vary but don't link to other properties reliably. Grid scaling (e.g., 3x3 vs. 4x4 in tests) affects bbox sizes but not the core interactions listed.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:09:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds vertical border column positions in the given row."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_panel_borders(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left and right border positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    """Extracts a 7-column panel row: left border + first 5 content cells + right border."""
    left_val = row[left]
    right_val = row[right]
    content_start = left + 1
    content_end = right
    content = row[content_start:content_end][:5]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all examples (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), I focused solely on obvious, consistent interactions or effects between elements. These are limited to properties that appear in **every** puzzle instance without exception. I ignored high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., single anomalous pixels in test input 2 that lack clear grid ties), and any forced explanations. Only direct, verifiable connections via properties like position, color, holes, bbox, and pixels are listed. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly tied to a consistent property (e.g., minor pixel variations), it is noted as unknown. No attempt is made to explain or predict puzzle logic.

#### 1. **Containment Interaction: Inner Shape BBox ⊂ Container BBox**
   - **Description**: Small inner shapes (holes=0, pixels=1–11, small bbox dimensions like width/height 1–3 units) are always fully contained within the bbox of a corresponding container (holes=1, pixels=8–25, larger bbox dimensions like 4–5 units wide/tall). The inner's bbox is a strict subset (overlaps in x and y ranges) of the container's bbox.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Inner bbox position (x1,y1,x2,y2) → directly affects container bbox (expands to enclose it, e.g., inner [2,2,4,4] inside container [1,1,5,5]).
     - Inner pixels (area) → contributes to container pixels (container pixels > inner pixels, but not a fixed ratio; e.g., inner 5 pixels inside container 19–20 pixels).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input and output across all examples (e.g., train input 1: yellow inner [2,2,4,4] in pink [1,1,5,5]; train output 1: same; train input 2: blue inner [2,2,4,4] in yellow [1,1,5,5]; test input 1: blue inner [2,2,5,5] in maroon [1,1,6,6]; test input 2: maroon inner [2,2,4,4] in green [1,1,5,5]). No exceptions, even in irregular cases (e.g., test input 2 single-pixel inner [9,9,9,9] inside [8,8,10,10]).
   - **Effect**: This creates a hierarchical structure where inners "nest" in containers, affecting overall layout density (containers cluster inners in grid spots).
   - **Unknowns**: Exact pixel difference between inner and container is not consistently tied to a property (varies 10–18 pixels difference); no clear effect from inner holes=0 on container holes=1 beyond basic enclosure.

#### 2. **Grid Position Alignment: Container/Innner Positions → Grid Coordinates**
   - **Description**: Containers and their inners share aligned grid positions, with consistent row y-ranges (e.g., y≈2–5, 8–11, 14–17, 23–27 across examples) and column x-ranges (e.g., x≈1–6, 7–13, 13–20, 19–27). Inners mirror container centers but with tighter bboxes.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Container bbox position → dictates inner bbox position (inner x/y centered or offset within container, e.g., container [1,1,5,5] aligns inner to [2,2,4,4]).
     - Row/column index (derived from y/x spacing, e.g., 6–7 unit gaps) → affects bbox dimensions slightly (e.g., inners in top rows often have balanced width/height like 2x2; lower rows may skew, like [2,14,4,15] height=1 in train output 1).
   - **Consistency**: Every example shows 3–4 rows and 3–4 columns with this alignment (e.g., train input 1: 3 rows/columns; train input 2: 3 rows/4 columns; test input 1: 4 rows/4 columns; test input 2: 3–4 rows/4 columns). Outputs preserve alignment for retained elements.
   - **Effect**: Positions enforce a modular grid, where changing row/column shifts bbox coordinates predictably (e.g., left column always x≈1–6).
   - **Unknowns**: Bbox dimension skews (e.g., width 1 vs. 3 units) are position-dependent but not explainable by a single property like row index alone—varies without clear pattern (e.g., test input 1 bottom inners p=5–11 inconsistent with position).

#### 3. **Holes Count Link: Container Holes → Background Holes**
   - **Description**: Each container (holes=1) contributes exactly one hole to the background (large object with holes=9–16, bbox covering entire grid like [0,0,18,18]).
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Number of containers (grid rows × columns) → sets background holes count (e.g., 3×3=9 in train input 1; 3×4=12 in train input 2; 4×4=16 in test input 1).
     - Container position/grid → affects background hole distribution (holes align with container positions, reducing background pixels in those areas).
   - **Consistency**: Exact match in every input (background holes = total containers); outputs reduce background holes to match selected containers (e.g., train outputs always holes=3 for 3 rows).
   - **Effect**: Containers "punch" holes into the background, reducing its effective area (background pixels ≈ total grid area minus container areas).
   - **Unknowns**: Rare cases of container holes>1 (e.g., test input 1 maroon holes=2) do not consistently propagate to background (background still holes=16); no clear link to inner properties.

#### 4. **Color Preservation: Element Color → Retained in Selection/Transformation**
   - **Description**: Colors of inners, containers, and background are fixed per puzzle and preserved through selection (e.g., in outputs, selected inners/containers keep input colors).
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Inner color (e.g., yellow/blue/maroon) → unchanged when position-selected (e.g., left column inners retain color in train outputs).
     - Container color (e.g., pink/yellow/maroon/green) → unchanged, but interacts with inner color for contrast (always distinct pairs: yellow-on-pink, blue-on-yellow, blue-on-maroon, maroon-on-green).
     - Background color (e.g., blue/green/yellow) → preserved in shrunk form (e.g., train input 1 blue → output blue).
   - **Consistency**: Every example has a unique 3-color scheme (inner/container/bg) with no swaps; train outputs retain exact colors for all elements.
   - **Effect**: Color acts as a "tag" that persists during position-based selection (e.g., left column elements keep colors, affecting visual distinction in outputs).
   - **Unknowns**: No consistent effect of color on movement/transformation (e.g., no position → color change observed); test input 2 anomalies (e.g., green inner-like [9,9,9,9]) still follow scheme but lack interaction explanation.

#### 5. **Position-Based Selection: Leftmost Column Position → Element Retention and Background Shrink**
   - **Description**: Elements in the leftmost column (x≈1–6) are consistently retained in outputs, with others removed; background bbox shrinks to match this column's width while preserving height.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Column position (leftmost x-range) → triggers retention of inner/container bboxes (shifted to start at x≈1–2 if needed) and reduces background bbox width to ~6 units (e.g., [0,0,6,18] in train outputs).
     - Row position (full y-range) → preserves all rows in selected column (e.g., 3 rows retained fully).
     - Background bbox → affected by selected column count (always 1 column → width=6, holes= row count=3 in trains).
   - **Consistency**: Exact in both train outputs (e.g., train input 1/2 left column elements → output; others absent); inputs show left column as structurally similar to others, implying position as the sole selector. Tests have analogous left columns (e.g., test input 1 x=1–6).
   - **Effect**: Left position "activates" retention, transforming background size (width shrinks, height/pixels adjust to ~58 for 3 rows) and filtering grid to 1 column.
   - **Unknowns**: Minor bbox/pixel tweaks in retained inners (e.g., train input 2 inner pixels 6→7; train output 1 bottom inner [2,14,4,15] height=1 vs. input height=2) have no clear tied property—possibly shape/orientation effect, but inconsistent across examples (e.g., test input 1 left inners p=11 unchanged in structure).

No other interactions (e.g., hole count → color, specific pixels → transformation, or shape silhouettes via bbox) are consistent across **every** example—many vary by grid size or appear only in subsets (e.g., rotational bbox changes in trains but not uniform in tests). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel objects without containment or grid tie) were excluded.

[2025-10-01 20:10:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row is filled with the frame color, indicating a border."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds all column indices in a row where the frame color appears (potential panel starts)."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_panel_starts(border_pos: List[int], W: int) -> List[int]:
    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds vertical border column positions in the given row."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_panel_borders(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left and right border positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    """Extracts a 7-column panel row: left border + first 5 content cells + right border."""
    left_val = row[left]
    right_val = row[right]
    content_start = left + 1
    content_end = right
    content = row[content_start:content_end][:5]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Finds vertical border column positions in the first non-border row of the current section."""
    frame_c = get_frame_color(g)
    r = 0
    H = len(g)
    while r < H and is_border_row(g[r], frame_c):
        r += 1
    if r == H:
        return []
    row = g[r]
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_starts_and_rights(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left-start and right-end positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all examples (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), I focused solely on obvious, consistent interactions or effects between elements. These are limited to properties that appear in **every** puzzle instance without exception. I ignored high-level interpretations, irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., single anomalous pixels in test input 2 that lack clear grid ties), and any forced explanations. Only direct, verifiable connections via properties like position, color, holes, bbox, and pixels are listed. Where a transformation or effect cannot be clearly tied to a consistent property (e.g., minor pixel variations), it is noted as unknown. No attempt is made to explain or predict puzzle logic.

#### 1. **Containment Interaction: Inner Shape BBox ⊂ Container BBox**
   - **Description**: Small inner shapes (holes=0, pixels=1–11, small bbox dimensions like width/height 1–3 units) are always fully contained within the bbox of a corresponding container (holes=1, pixels=8–25, larger bbox dimensions like 4–5 units wide/tall). The inner's bbox is a strict subset (overlaps in x and y ranges) of the container's bbox.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Inner bbox position (x1,y1,x2,y2) → directly affects container bbox (expands to enclose it, e.g., inner [2,2,4,4] inside container [1,1,5,5]).
     - Inner pixels (area) → contributes to container pixels (container pixels > inner pixels, but not a fixed ratio; e.g., inner 5 pixels inside container 19–20 pixels).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every input and output across all examples (e.g., train input 1: yellow inner [2,2,4,4] in pink [1,1,5,5]; train output 1: same; train input 2: blue inner [2,2,4,4] in yellow [1,1,5,5]; test input 1: blue inner [2,2,5,5] in maroon [1,1,6,6]; test input 2: maroon inner [2,2,4,4] in green [1,1,5,5]). No exceptions, even in irregular cases (e.g., test input 2 single-pixel inner [9,9,9,9] inside [8,8,10,10]).
   - **Effect**: This creates a hierarchical structure where inners "nest" in containers, affecting overall layout density (containers cluster inners in grid spots).
   - **Unknowns**: Exact pixel difference between inner and container is not consistently tied to a property (varies 10–18 pixels difference); no clear effect from inner holes=0 on container holes=1 beyond basic enclosure.

#### 2. **Grid Position Alignment: Container/Innner Positions → Grid Coordinates**
   - **Description**: Containers and their inners share aligned grid positions, with consistent row y-ranges (e.g., y≈2–5, 8–11, 14–17, 23–27 across examples) and column x-ranges (e.g., x≈1–6, 7–13, 13–20, 19–27). Inners mirror container centers but with tighter bboxes.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Container bbox position → dictates inner bbox position (inner x/y centered or offset within container, e.g., container [1,1,5,5] aligns inner to [2,2,4,4]).
     - Row/column index (derived from y/x spacing, e.g., 6–7 unit gaps) → affects bbox dimensions slightly (e.g., inners in top rows often have balanced width/height like 2x2; lower rows may skew, like [2,14,4,15] height=1 in train output 1).
   - **Consistency**: Every example shows 3–4 rows and 3–4 columns with this alignment (e.g., train input 1: 3 rows/columns; train input 2: 3 rows/4 columns; test input 1: 4 rows/4 columns; test input 2: 3–4 rows/4 columns). Outputs preserve alignment for retained elements.
   - **Effect**: Positions enforce a modular grid, where changing row/column shifts bbox coordinates predictably (e.g., left column always x≈1–6).
   - **Unknowns**: Bbox dimension skews (e.g., width 1 vs. 3 units) are position-dependent but not explainable by a single property like row index alone—varies without clear pattern (e.g., test input 1 bottom inners p=5–11 inconsistent with position).

#### 3. **Holes Count Link: Container Holes → Background Holes**
   - **Description**: Each container (holes=1) contributes exactly one hole to the background (large object with holes=9–16, bbox covering entire grid like [0,0,18,18]).
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Number of containers (grid rows × columns) → sets background holes count (e.g., 3×3=9 in train input 1; 3×4=12 in train input 2; 4×4=16 in test input 1).
     - Container position/grid → affects background hole distribution (holes align with container positions, reducing background pixels in those areas).
   - **Consistency**: Exact match in every input (background holes = total containers); outputs reduce background holes to match selected containers (e.g., train outputs always holes=3 for 3 rows).
   - **Effect**: Containers "punch" holes into the background, reducing its effective area (background pixels ≈ total grid area minus container areas).
   - **Unknowns**: Rare cases of container holes>1 (e.g., test input 1 maroon holes=2) do not consistently propagate to background (background still holes=16); no clear link to inner properties.

#### 4. **Color Preservation: Element Color → Retained in Selection/Transformation**
   - **Description**: Colors of inners, containers, and background are fixed per puzzle and preserved through selection (e.g., in outputs, selected inners/containers keep input colors).
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Inner color (e.g., yellow/blue/maroon) → unchanged when position-selected (e.g., left column inners retain color in train outputs).
     - Container color (e.g., pink/yellow/maroon/green) → unchanged, but interacts with inner color for contrast (always distinct pairs: yellow-on-pink, blue-on-yellow, blue-on-maroon, maroon-on-green).
     - Background color (e.g., blue/green/yellow) → preserved in shrunk form (e.g., train input 1 blue → output blue).
   - **Consistency**: Every example has a unique 3-color scheme (inner/container/bg) with no swaps; train outputs retain exact colors for all elements.
   - **Effect**: Color acts as a "tag" that persists during position-based selection (e.g., left column elements keep colors, affecting visual distinction in outputs).
   - **Unknowns**: No consistent effect of color on movement/transformation (e.g., no position → color change observed); test input 2 anomalies (e.g., green inner-like [9,9,9,9]) still follow scheme but lack interaction explanation.

#### 5. **Position-Based Selection: Leftmost Column Position → Element Retention and Background Shrink**
   - **Description**: Elements in the leftmost column (x≈1–6) are consistently retained in outputs, with others removed; background bbox shrinks to match this column's width while preserving height.
   - **Interacting Properties**:
     - Column position (leftmost x-range) → triggers retention of inner/container bboxes (shifted to start at x≈1–2 if needed) and reduces background bbox width to ~6 units (e.g., [0,0,6,18] in train outputs).
     - Row position (full y-range) → preserves all rows in selected column (e.g., 3 rows retained fully).
     - Background bbox → affected by selected column count (always 1 column → width=6, holes= row count=3 in trains).
   - **Consistency**: Exact in both train outputs (e.g., train input 1/2 left column elements → output; others absent); inputs show left column as structurally similar to others, implying position as the sole selector. Tests have analogous left columns (e.g., test input 1 x=1–6).
   - **Effect**: Left position "activates" retention, transforming background size (width shrinks, height/pixels adjust to ~58 for 3 rows) and filtering grid to 1 column.
   - **Unknowns**: Minor bbox/pixel tweaks in retained inners (e.g., train input 2 inner pixels 6→7; train output 1 bottom inner [2,14,4,15] height=1 vs. input height=2) have no clear tied property—possibly shape/orientation effect, but inconsistent across examples (e.g., test input 1 left inners p=11 unchanged in structure).

No other interactions (e.g., hole count → color, specific pixels → transformation, or shape silhouettes via bbox) are consistent across **every** example—many vary by grid size or appear only in subsets (e.g., rotational bbox changes in trains but not uniform in tests). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel objects without containment or grid tie) were excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:12:37] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured like framed sections (e.g., comic panels or divided regions) separated by solid border rows of a uniform frame color, where each section contains multiple sub-panels divided by vertical frame lines, and the goal is to extract and output a specific sub-panel from each section based on rules tied to the section's position, resizing it to a standard 7-column width while preserving the frame borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts and ends with (and is separated by) full border rows consisting entirely of the frame color (e.g., all 4s), which act as dividers between sections; these must be copied verbatim to the output as 7-wide rows of frame color.
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell (or 0 if empty), assuming it's consistent across the grid; borders in sections are vertical lines of this color separating sub-panels.
 * Each non-border section has a variable number of sub-panels (num_panels = number of border positions - 1), identified by positions where the row hits the frame color; extraction targets a specific sub-panel index per section (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second, etc.), falling back to valid ranges if needed.
 * Sub-panel extraction slices content between left and right border positions, taking exactly the left border value, the first 5 content cells (to standardize width), and the right border value, resulting in 7-column rows; this is applied row-by-row for the entire section height until the next border row.
 * Sections without panels (no borders found) are skipped entirely, advancing past them without output.
 * Section index increments only after processing a valid section with panels, ensuring selection logic applies sequentially to content-bearing sections.
 * Subtle: Vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows (but code assumes they do for extraction); content may include colors like 8 (possibly inner frames or fillers) or 1 (patterns), which are preserved as-is without interpretation.
 * Easy to miss: Overly wide sections may have content beyond the 5-slice, leading to truncation; fallback logic (e.g., panel_idx = num_panels - 1 if out of range) prevents crashes but may select wrong panels; repetitive sections in input could lead to near-identical outputs if selection always picks similar sub-panels.
 * All attempts must handle empty grids (return empty list) and ensure output rows are exactly 7 elements; no rotation, flipping, or merging of extracted panels—output stacks them sequentially with borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Identifies the uniform frame color from top-left; essential for detecting borders and assuming consistency.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is a full horizontal border; key for section delimiting and copying borders to output.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1:right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```
(Cores extraction logic: grabs left/right borders and exactly 5 inner cells to standardize to 7 columns; handles variable widths by truncation, preserving frame values.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects which sub-panel to extract based on section order and panel count; includes fallbacks for varying num_panels, e.g., picks middle-ish or edge panels; crucial for puzzle's selection rule.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, correctly identifying frame color, detecting border rows, extracting the right sub-panel per section, and standardizing to 7 columns without errors.
 * The section-skipping logic for empty sections worked, as did incrementing section_idx only after valid extractions.
 * choose_panel_index handled specific cases (e.g., index 2 for first section, assuming at least 3 panels) with fallbacks, which aligned with training data.
 * extract_panel_row's 5-content slice correctly truncated wider panels, preserving borders as frame color.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes vertical borders align across section rows (uses first row's positions for all), which could fail if misaligned—though it worked for training.
 * get_frame_color and is_border_row are robust and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but prior attempts (implied) might have lacked fallback in choose_panel_index, causing index errors on low-panel sections.
 * Overall, core loop (while r < H, check border vs. section start) effectively parsed structure without overcomplicating.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 8 stacked sections (each ~7 rows high), starting/ending with full [4]*7 border rows, and inner sections showing 7-column panels with left/right 4 borders, inner 8s (likely filler or sub-frame), and patterns of 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], [4,8,1,8,8,1,4], etc.); sections are nearly identical, repeating the same 5-row pattern of 1/8 arrangements flanked by 8-filled rows.
 * This looks partially correct in structure (borders copied, extractions standardized to 7 columns, sections delimited), but suspicious due to high repetition—suggests the test input has multiple similar multi-panel sections (e.g., 4+ panels each), and the program consistently selected a sub-panel with 8-heavy content and simple 1 patterns, possibly the second or third panel if sections have 3+ panels.
 * It does not look fully correct because the patterns (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s or blobs) across the 5 content columns seem truncated or simplistic; expected output might combine or select varying sub-panels (e.g., alternating left/middle/right) to form a progressive puzzle image, but here all sections output near-identical panels, missing variety—possibly wrong panel selection for later sections (e.g., choose_panel_index's else clause picking edges too predictably).
 * The 8s as inner elements are preserved correctly (not treated as frames), but if the puzzle intends 8s as secondary borders, extraction might need nested slicing (not handled); output height matches multi-section input, but without the actual test grid, the repetition implies over-extraction or input similarity, differing from expected by lacking diversity in selected content.
 * Note: The output is different from a "correct" expectation of a single cohesive image or varied panel sequence; it's a stack of similar extracts, which may not solve the visual puzzle (e.g., if goal is to reveal a hidden picture by picking specific panels).

[2025-10-01 20:13:13] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided inputs and the two train outputs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interconnections** between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every example** (train inputs/outputs and test inputs) and show clear, repeated interactions or effects (e.g., nesting, adjacency, or transformation triggers). Only consistent patterns across **all** visuals are included—no assumptions about puzzle-solving logic, no high-level interpretations, and no forced connections (e.g., no semantic meanings for shapes like "L" or "H", as they are not explicitly tied to interactions here). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., minor single-pixel outliers in test input 2, varying shape pixels/sizes within cells, or non-repeated color shifts) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes or why holes reduce to a specific number) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Cell Bounding Box (bbox) → Shape Bounding Box (bbox) [Nesting/Containment Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Each cell (colored Pink/Yellow/Maroon/Green, holes=1) consistently contains exactly one primary shape (colored differently: Yellow/Blue/Maroon, holes=0) positioned inside it. The shape's bbox is fully nested within the cell's bbox, sharing the same y-range (vertical alignment) but offset inward on x (horizontal centering).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Cell bbox: Starts at x≈1/7/13/19/... (grid column starts), width≈4-5 units, y-ranges in stacked rows (e.g., [1-5], [7-11], [13-17], [19-23]).
     - Shape bbox: Starts at x≈2/8/14/20/... (inside cell), width≈2-3 units, same y-range as containing cell.
   - **Consistency**: Appears in every input (train 1, train 2, test 1, test 2). No overlaps or multiple shapes per cell. In train outputs, only nested pairs from specific positions (see interaction #4) are retained; nesting structure unchanged.
   - **Effect**: Shape position is directly affected by cell bbox (shape cannot exist outside cell boundaries). No color or holes change due to this.

#### 2. **Cell Color → Shape Color [Color Differentiation Interaction]**
   - **Description**: The color of each cell consistently differs from the color of its contained shape, creating a paired contrast (e.g., Pink cell → Yellow shape; Yellow cell → Blue shape; Maroon cell → Blue shape; Green cell → Maroon shape).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Cell colors: Pink (train 1), Yellow (train 2), Maroon (test 1), Green (test 2).
     - Shape colors: Always the "complementary" in the pair (Yellow/Blue/Maroon), never matching the cell.
   - **Consistency**: Every cell-shape pair in all inputs follows this (no same-color pairs). Retained in train outputs for selected pairs.
   - **Effect**: Ensures visual distinction; no further transformation (e.g., no color swap or influence on movement/position).

#### 3. **Cell Holes (=1) ↔ Shape Holes (=0) [Structural Complement Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Cells always have exactly 1 hole, while their contained shapes always have 0 holes. This creates a consistent "solid shape within holed container" structure.
   - **Properties Involved**: Holes count only (no tie to pixels or bbox size).
   - **Consistency**: Universal across all cell-shape pairs in every input. In train outputs, selected cells retain holes=1, shapes holes=0.
   - **Effect**: Holes in cell appear to "accommodate" the solid (hole-free) shape without overlap; no change to holes count in outputs.

#### 4. **Grid Column Position (x-start of bbox) → Selection/Inclusion in Output [Positional Selection Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Elements (cells and their contained shapes) with the leftmost column position (x-start ≈1 for cells, ≈2 for shapes) are consistently prioritized. In train outputs, only these leftmost elements (one full vertical stack/column) are included, while others are excluded.
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - x-start of bbox: Leftmost column fixed at ≈1 (cells) / ≈2 (shapes); other columns at ≈7/13/19/... are ignored in outputs.
     - y-range: All rows (top-to-bottom) in the leftmost column are included (e.g., 3 rows in trains, 4 in tests).
   - **Consistency**: Train outputs show exact selection of leftmost column elements (e.g., train 1: cells/shapes at x=1-5/2-4; train 2: x=1-5/2-4). Test inputs follow same grid positioning, implying same interaction (though outputs not provided). No selection of other columns.
   - **Effect**: Column position directly affects inclusion/exclusion; non-leftmost elements vanish in outputs. No effect on individual properties like color or holes.

#### 5. **Overall Background Bbox → Grid Cells/Shapes Bbox [Enclosure Interaction]**
   - **Description**: The background (Blue/Green/Yellow, high holes) consistently encloses all cells and shapes, with its bbox fully containing the grid (x: 0 to max grid width ≈18/24/28; y: 0 to max grid height ≈18/24/28).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Background bbox: Starts at [0,0,...], ends at full grid extents (e.g., [0,0,18,18] in train 1).
     - Cell/shape bboxes: Nested inside background, aligned to grid lines.
   - **Consistency**: Every input has one background enclosing all others. No exceptions.
   - **Effect**: Background position/scale is affected by total grid size (expands to fit all cells/shapes). In train outputs, background bbox transforms (x-max reduced to ≈6, matching one column width; y unchanged), but enclosure of selected elements preserved.

#### 6. **Grid Size (Rows × Columns) → Background Holes [Quantitative Scaling Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Background holes count consistently equals the total number of cells in the grid (rows × columns).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Holes: Background only (e.g., 3 rows × 3 cols = 9 in train 1; 3×4=12 in train 2; 4×4=16 in both tests).
     - Grid dimensions: Inferred from cell y/x-starts (3 rows in trains, 4 in tests; 3/4 cols based on x-spacing).
   - **Consistency**: Exact match in every input. In train outputs, background holes reduce to match selected portion (e.g., 3 rows × 1 col = 3), but the scaling rule holds.
   - **Effect**: Total grid cell count directly sets background holes (additive per cell). Unknown why it reduces precisely to rows×1 in outputs (consistent but unexplained scaling factor).

#### Notes on Exclusions and Limits
- **No Consistent Color → Movement/Transformation**: Colors pair consistently (see #2) but do not affect position, holes, or bbox changes beyond differentiation. No evidence of colors triggering movement or rotation across examples.
- **No Shape Properties → Broader Effects**: Shape-specific traits (e.g., pixels=4-7, bbox widths=2-3) vary slightly but do not consistently interact (e.g., no hole count → color link; pixels seem rendering artifacts, not causal).
- **No Position → Color/Holes Changes**: Positions nest/enclose consistently (see #1, #4, #5) but do not alter colors or holes—only inclusion or bbox scaling.
- **Unknowns**: Minor pixel count variations (e.g., 19→18 in cells) occur in outputs but are not consistent triggers (possibly overlap/rendering, not explainable here). Background holes reduction in outputs follows grid scaling (#6) but exact mechanism (e.g., why per-cell subtraction) is unknown and consistent only in trains.
- **Irrelevant Elements Excluded**: Single-pixel or edge Maroon/Green (test 2), small Blue outliers (test 1 bottom), or non-nested shapes ignored—no connections to main grid/cells in any example.

This list captures only the repeated, obvious interconnections without attempting to derive a full puzzle rule.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:13:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0]
```

def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row is filled with the frame color, indicating a border."""

    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

    content_end = right
    content = row[content_start:content_end][:5]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured like framed sections (e.g., comic panels or divided regions) separated by solid border rows of a uniform frame color, where each section contains multiple sub-panels divided by vertical frame lines, and the goal is to extract and output a specific sub-panel from each section based on rules tied to the section's position, resizing it to a standard 7-column width while preserving the frame borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts and ends with (and is separated by) full border rows consisting entirely of the frame color (e.g., all 4s), which act as dividers between sections; these must be copied verbatim to the output as 7-wide rows of frame color.
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell (or 0 if empty), assuming it's consistent across the grid; borders in sections are vertical lines of this color separating sub-panels.
 * Each non-border section has a variable number of sub-panels (num_panels = number of border positions - 1), identified by positions where the row hits the frame color; extraction targets a specific sub-panel index per section (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second, etc.), falling back to valid ranges if needed.
 * Sub-panel extraction slices content between left and right border positions, taking exactly the left border value, the first 5 content cells (to standardize width), and the right border value, resulting in 7-column rows; this is applied row-by-row for the entire section height until the next border row.
 * Sections without panels (no borders found) are skipped entirely, advancing past them without output.
 * Section index increments only after processing a valid section with panels, ensuring selection logic applies sequentially to content-bearing sections.
 * Subtle: Vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows (but code assumes they do for extraction); content may include colors like 8 (possibly inner frames or fillers) or 1 (patterns), which are preserved as-is without interpretation.
 * Easy to miss: Overly wide sections may have content beyond the 5-slice, leading to truncation; fallback logic (e.g., panel_idx = num_panels - 1 if out of range) prevents crashes but may select wrong panels; repetitive sections in input could lead to near-identical outputs if selection always picks similar sub-panels.
 * All attempts must handle empty grids (return empty list) and ensure output rows are exactly 7 elements; no rotation, flipping, or merging of extracted panels—output stacks them sequentially with borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Identifies the uniform frame color from top-left; essential for detecting borders and assuming consistency.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is a full horizontal border; key for section delimiting and copying borders to output.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1:right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```
(Cores extraction logic: grabs left/right borders and exactly 5 inner cells to standardize to 7 columns; handles variable widths by truncation, preserving frame values.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects which sub-panel to extract based on section order and panel count; includes fallbacks for varying num_panels, e.g., picks middle-ish or edge panels; crucial for puzzle's selection rule.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, correctly identifying frame color, detecting border rows, extracting the right sub-panel per section, and standardizing to 7 columns without errors.
 * The section-skipping logic for empty sections worked, as did incrementing section_idx only after valid extractions.
 * choose_panel_index handled specific cases (e.g., index 2 for first section, assuming at least 3 panels) with fallbacks, which aligned with training data.
 * extract_panel_row's 5-content slice correctly truncated wider panels, preserving borders as frame color.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes vertical borders align across section rows (uses first row's positions for all), which could fail if misaligned—though it worked for training.
 * get_frame_color and is_border_row are robust and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but prior attempts (implied) might have lacked fallback in choose_panel_index, causing index errors on low-panel sections.
 * Overall, core loop (while r < H, check border vs. section start) effectively parsed structure without overcomplicating.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 8 stacked sections (each ~7 rows high), starting/ending with full [4]*7 border rows, and inner sections showing 7-column panels with left/right 4 borders, inner 8s (likely filler or sub-frame), and patterns of 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], [4,8,1,8,8,1,4], etc.); sections are nearly identical, repeating the same 5-row pattern of 1/8 arrangements flanked by 8-filled rows.
 * This looks partially correct in structure (borders copied, extractions standardized to 7 columns, sections delimited), but suspicious due to high repetition—suggests the test input has multiple similar multi-panel sections (e.g., 4+ panels each), and the program consistently selected a sub-panel with 8-heavy content and simple 1 patterns, possibly the second or third panel if sections have 3+ panels.
 * It does not look fully correct because the patterns (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s or blobs) across the 5 content columns seem truncated or simplistic; expected output might combine or select varying sub-panels (e.g., alternating left/middle/right) to form a progressive puzzle image, but here all sections output near-identical panels, missing variety—possibly wrong panel selection for later sections (e.g., choose_panel_index's else clause picking edges too predictably).
 * The 8s as inner elements are preserved correctly (not treated as frames), but if the puzzle intends 8s as secondary borders, extraction might need nested slicing (not handled); output height matches multi-section input, but without the actual test grid, the repetition implies over-extraction or input similarity, differing from expected by lacking diversity in selected content.
 * Note: The output is different from a "correct" expectation of a single cohesive image or varied panel sequence; it's a stack of similar extracts, which may not solve the visual puzzle (e.g., if goal is to reveal a hidden picture by picking specific panels).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Finds vertical border column positions in the first non-border row of the current section."""
    frame_c = get_frame_color(g)
    r = 0
    H = len(g)
    while r < H and is_border_row(g[r], frame_c):
        r += 1
    if r == H:
        return []
    row = g[r]
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_starts_and_rights(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left-start and right-end positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided inputs and the two train outputs, below is a list of **obvious and consistent interconnections** between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every example** (train inputs/outputs and test inputs) and show clear, repeated interactions or effects (e.g., nesting, adjacency, or transformation triggers). Only consistent patterns across **all** visuals are included—no assumptions about puzzle-solving logic, no high-level interpretations, and no forced connections (e.g., no semantic meanings for shapes like "L" or "H", as they are not explicitly tied to interactions here). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., minor single-pixel outliers in test input 2, varying shape pixels/sizes within cells, or non-repeated color shifts) are excluded. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes or why holes reduce to a specific number) are noted as such rather than explained.

#### 1. **Cell Bounding Box (bbox) → Shape Bounding Box (bbox) [Nesting/Containment Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Each cell (colored Pink/Yellow/Maroon/Green, holes=1) consistently contains exactly one primary shape (colored differently: Yellow/Blue/Maroon, holes=0) positioned inside it. The shape's bbox is fully nested within the cell's bbox, sharing the same y-range (vertical alignment) but offset inward on x (horizontal centering).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Cell bbox: Starts at x≈1/7/13/19/... (grid column starts), width≈4-5 units, y-ranges in stacked rows (e.g., [1-5], [7-11], [13-17], [19-23]).
     - Shape bbox: Starts at x≈2/8/14/20/... (inside cell), width≈2-3 units, same y-range as containing cell.
   - **Consistency**: Appears in every input (train 1, train 2, test 1, test 2). No overlaps or multiple shapes per cell. In train outputs, only nested pairs from specific positions (see interaction #4) are retained; nesting structure unchanged.
   - **Effect**: Shape position is directly affected by cell bbox (shape cannot exist outside cell boundaries). No color or holes change due to this.

#### 2. **Cell Color → Shape Color [Color Differentiation Interaction]**
   - **Description**: The color of each cell consistently differs from the color of its contained shape, creating a paired contrast (e.g., Pink cell → Yellow shape; Yellow cell → Blue shape; Maroon cell → Blue shape; Green cell → Maroon shape).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Cell colors: Pink (train 1), Yellow (train 2), Maroon (test 1), Green (test 2).
     - Shape colors: Always the "complementary" in the pair (Yellow/Blue/Maroon), never matching the cell.
   - **Consistency**: Every cell-shape pair in all inputs follows this (no same-color pairs). Retained in train outputs for selected pairs.
   - **Effect**: Ensures visual distinction; no further transformation (e.g., no color swap or influence on movement/position).

#### 3. **Cell Holes (=1) ↔ Shape Holes (=0) [Structural Complement Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Cells always have exactly 1 hole, while their contained shapes always have 0 holes. This creates a consistent "solid shape within holed container" structure.
   - **Properties Involved**: Holes count only (no tie to pixels or bbox size).
   - **Consistency**: Universal across all cell-shape pairs in every input. In train outputs, selected cells retain holes=1, shapes holes=0.
   - **Effect**: Holes in cell appear to "accommodate" the solid (hole-free) shape without overlap; no change to holes count in outputs.

#### 4. **Grid Column Position (x-start of bbox) → Selection/Inclusion in Output [Positional Selection Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Elements (cells and their contained shapes) with the leftmost column position (x-start ≈1 for cells, ≈2 for shapes) are consistently prioritized. In train outputs, only these leftmost elements (one full vertical stack/column) are included, while others are excluded.
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - x-start of bbox: Leftmost column fixed at ≈1 (cells) / ≈2 (shapes); other columns at ≈7/13/19/... are ignored in outputs.
     - y-range: All rows (top-to-bottom) in the leftmost column are included (e.g., 3 rows in trains, 4 in tests).
   - **Consistency**: Train outputs show exact selection of leftmost column elements (e.g., train 1: cells/shapes at x=1-5/2-4; train 2: x=1-5/2-4). Test inputs follow same grid positioning, implying same interaction (though outputs not provided). No selection of other columns.
   - **Effect**: Column position directly affects inclusion/exclusion; non-leftmost elements vanish in outputs. No effect on individual properties like color or holes.

#### 5. **Overall Background Bbox → Grid Cells/Shapes Bbox [Enclosure Interaction]**
   - **Description**: The background (Blue/Green/Yellow, high holes) consistently encloses all cells and shapes, with its bbox fully containing the grid (x: 0 to max grid width ≈18/24/28; y: 0 to max grid height ≈18/24/28).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Background bbox: Starts at [0,0,...], ends at full grid extents (e.g., [0,0,18,18] in train 1).
     - Cell/shape bboxes: Nested inside background, aligned to grid lines.
   - **Consistency**: Every input has one background enclosing all others. No exceptions.
   - **Effect**: Background position/scale is affected by total grid size (expands to fit all cells/shapes). In train outputs, background bbox transforms (x-max reduced to ≈6, matching one column width; y unchanged), but enclosure of selected elements preserved.

#### 6. **Grid Size (Rows × Columns) → Background Holes [Quantitative Scaling Interaction]**
   - **Description**: Background holes count consistently equals the total number of cells in the grid (rows × columns).
   - **Properties Involved**: 
     - Holes: Background only (e.g., 3 rows × 3 cols = 9 in train 1; 3×4=12 in train 2; 4×4=16 in both tests).
     - Grid dimensions: Inferred from cell y/x-starts (3 rows in trains, 4 in tests; 3/4 cols based on x-spacing).
   - **Consistency**: Exact match in every input. In train outputs, background holes reduce to match selected portion (e.g., 3 rows × 1 col = 3), but the scaling rule holds.
   - **Effect**: Total grid cell count directly sets background holes (additive per cell). Unknown why it reduces precisely to rows×1 in outputs (consistent but unexplained scaling factor).

#### Notes on Exclusions and Limits
- **No Consistent Color → Movement/Transformation**: Colors pair consistently (see #2) but do not affect position, holes, or bbox changes beyond differentiation. No evidence of colors triggering movement or rotation across examples.
- **No Shape Properties → Broader Effects**: Shape-specific traits (e.g., pixels=4-7, bbox widths=2-3) vary slightly but do not consistently interact (e.g., no hole count → color link; pixels seem rendering artifacts, not causal).
- **No Position → Color/Holes Changes**: Positions nest/enclose consistently (see #1, #4, #5) but do not alter colors or holes—only inclusion or bbox scaling.
- **Unknowns**: Minor pixel count variations (e.g., 19→18 in cells) occur in outputs but are not consistent triggers (possibly overlap/rendering, not explainable here). Background holes reduction in outputs follows grid scaling (#6) but exact mechanism (e.g., why per-cell subtraction) is unknown and consistent only in trains.
- **Irrelevant Elements Excluded**: Single-pixel or edge Maroon/Green (test 2), small Blue outliers (test 1 bottom), or non-nested shapes ignored—no connections to main grid/cells in any example.

This list captures only the repeated, obvious interconnections without attempting to derive a full puzzle rule.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:15:52] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) structured as framed sections, likely resembling comic panels or divided images, where the task is to extract and output a specific 7-cell-wide panel from each section based on section index and number of panels, preserving frames and inner content while handling borders and varying panel counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows that are entirely one color (frame color, often 4), separating vertical sections; these must be copied as full 7-cell frame rows in output.
 * Within sections, panels are vertically aligned and separated by vertical frame-color columns (also 4); the number of panels is one less than the number of frame positions in a row.
 * Panel extraction takes the left and right frame cells, plus up to 5 inner content cells (sliced from left+1 to right, taking first 5), always outputting exactly 7 cells per row (pad with frame color if short, truncate if long, though grids seem designed to fit).
 * Panel selection depends on section index (0-based, incrementing per section) and number of panels: e.g., section 0 picks the 3rd panel (index 2), section 1 picks first (0), section 2 picks middle (1) or last if not 3 panels, later sections alternate first/last based on parity.
 * Frame color is determined from top-left cell; assume consistent across grid.
 * Sections must be detected by transitioning from border to non-border rows; invalid sections (no panels) are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Ensure bounds checking to avoid index errors; content rows may have varying widths but extraction assumes W is consistent; repeated identical sections in test suggest symmetric or patterned input, but selection logic must handle varying num_panels (e.g., 2 vs 3 panels changes section 2 choice).
 * Easy to miss: Padding only with frame color if under 7; not all sections have the same num_panels, so min() clamp in panel_idx prevents overflow; vertical alignment assumes all rows in section have same border positions.
 * Overall output maintains section structure with extracted panels "zoomed" to 7-wide, including top/bottom borders as full frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This reliably detects the frame color from top-left, assuming consistent framing.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Essential for identifying and copying full border rows; simple and accurate.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    return [row[left]] + content + [row[right]]
```
(Core extraction logic; correctly grabs frames + limited inner content to fit 7-wide; add padding/truncation in main function as needed.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Panel selection rule; handles special cases for early sections and alternates for later ones; clamping with min(panel_idx, num_panels-1) prevents errors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic section detection, border copying, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely simpler grids with 2-3 panels and fewer sections).
 * Worked well for frame color detection and border row identification, as training passed without errors.
 * Panel extraction via extract_panel_row produced correct 7-wide outputs with frames intact for training.
 * choose_panel_index correctly selected panels for early sections (0,1,2) in training, suggesting the rules match those examples.
 * Did not fail on bounds or empty grids in training, showing robust in_section tracking and skipping.
 * However, for more complex cases like the test (multiple identical sections), it may over-rely on assuming consistent num_panels; if test has varying panels per section, selection could pick wrong (e.g., index 2 invalid if only 2 panels).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, etc.) are relevant and worked for training—none are broken, but main loop could improve section ending detection if borders are missed.
 * Overall, core structure (while loop scanning rows, starting sections on non-borders) is solid but untested on repetition or asymmetry.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 4 repeated sections (each: top border [4]*7, 6 content rows like [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] down to patterns with 1s, bottom border [4]*7), followed by an extra border, totaling ~29 rows with identical content across sections.
 * This suggests the program detected 4 sections, extracted the same panel (likely index 0 or leftmost, given consistent starting 4,8,... patterns) from each, assuming num_panels >=2 and sections have identical inner content (8 as background, 1 as details like shapes or letters).
 * The output makes sense structurally (preserves frames, 7-wide, section separation) and matches extraction rules: e.g., first content [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] implies 5 inner 8s from a wider panel; later rows show sliced content like [8,1,1,8,1] which could be partial shapes.
 * However, repetition of identical sections implies the input grid has symmetric or tiled content, but if choose_panel_index intended variety (e.g., section 0 picks index 2/middle, section 1 picks 0/left), the identical output suggests either all sections have 3+ panels with middle identical to left, or logic fell back to left (e.g., due to num_panels=2 clamping index 2 to 1, but still same if symmetric).
 * It does not look fully correct if the puzzle expects different panels per section (e.g., varying images); the uniformity might miss subtle differences in input panels, or fail to alternate properly for later sections (idx 3 should pick last if even). Unknown why identical—possibly input is repetitive, but expected output should show progression/variation if selecting different panels.
 * Positive: No crashes or invalid rows; patterns like [8,1,1,8,1] resemble sliced comic elements (e.g., letters 'B' or shapes in 1s), so extraction works, but verify if it matches expected by mentally simulating: if test input has 3 panels per section with distinct content, output should differ across sections, not repeat identically.

[2025-10-01 20:16:01] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all examples (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), I identified only obvious, direct interactions or connections between components/properties that are consistent in **every** case. These are limited to structural relationships (e.g., containment via bbox overlap) and property correlations (e.g., counts) that hold universally without variation or exceptions. I ignored any high-level patterns, semantic meanings (e.g., tetromino types), or transformations, as instructed. No forced explanations—where a connection (e.g., exact pixel causation) cannot be directly tied consistently, I note it as unknown. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., varying colors, inconsistent pixel totals, or non-interacting singletons) are excluded. Only interactions present in 100% of the examples are listed.

#### 1. **Background ↔ Containers (Encompassment and Hole Count Correlation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Background (large single object: full-image bbox like [0,0,W,H], high holes=9–16, low-to-medium pixels=58–265, colors vary: blue/green/yellow/blue). Containers (multiple medium objects: bbox span ~4–6 units, holes=1, pixels=18–25, colors vary: pink/yellow/maroon/green).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: The background's bbox fully encompasses all containers' bboxes (no container extends beyond background bounds). The background's `holes` property directly equals the total count of container objects (e.g., holes=9 with 9 containers; holes=12 with 12; holes=16 with 16; holes=3 with 3). This holds positionally (containers embedded within background) and quantitatively (hole count as a 1:1 match to container count).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example (all inputs and outputs). No exceptions.
   - **Unknowns**: Causation unclear (e.g., whether containers "create" background holes via position or shape—cannot confirm consistently without solving).

#### 2. **Containers ↔ Small Shapes (Containment via Bbox Nesting)**
   - **Components Involved**: Containers (as above). Small shapes (multiple low-size objects: bbox span ~1–4 units, holes=0, pixels=1–11, colors vary: yellow/blue/maroon; these are the non-background, non-container filled regions).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Each container's bbox strictly contains (nests) at least one small shape's bbox entirely within it (shape min/max coords subset of container's; no shape spans multiple containers or escapes its container). Small shapes do not interact with each other directly (no bbox overlap between shapes). Containers have holes=1, while contained shapes have holes=0 (consistent property contrast enabling nesting).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example (all inputs and outputs). Every container has at least one nested shape; no un-nested shapes or empty containers.
   - **Unknowns**: Exact number of shapes per container is not always 1 (e.g., some have multiple disconnected shape components, as in test input 2); total shape pixels per container varies (4–11 total, but no consistent sum relation to container pixels). Pixel count or bbox size of shapes does not consistently affect container properties (e.g., no fixed delta).

#### 3. **Grid Position → Container/Small Shape Bbox (Positional Determination)**
   - **Components Involved**: Containers and small shapes (as above). Implicit grid (inferred from bbox coords: regular spacing ~6 units horizontally/vertically, e.g., container starts at x~1/7/8/13/15/19/22, y~1/7/8/13/15/19/22).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: A container's absolute grid position (row/column index, derived from its bbox start coords) determines both its own bbox size/span (~4–6 units, fixed per grid) and the relative bbox of its nested small shape (shape's offset/span within container varies predictably by grid position, e.g., top-row containers often have shapes with y-span starting near container min-y; left-column with x-span near min-x). This creates a position-to-bbox mapping (e.g., column 1 positions always yield shapes with x-start ~2 relative to container x=1).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example (all inputs and outputs). All bboxes align to the same ~6-unit grid spacing; relative shape bboxes within containers follow position-based patterns without deviation (e.g., no random offsets).
   - **Unknowns**: Specific mapping rule (e.g., exact row/col → relative x/y offset or span size) cannot be explained without transformation details—position affects bbox but how/why is unknown. No consistent effect on other properties (e.g., position → pixels or holes is absent).

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-position, pixels-to-holes, or shape-to-background direct effects) are consistent across every example—variations in colors, pixel counts, and minor bbox anomalies (e.g., rare small extra objects) prevent inclusion. No total solution or broader understanding inferred.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:17:37] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0]
```

    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

    content_start = left + 1
    content_end = right
    content = row[content_start:content_end][:5]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured like framed sections (e.g., comic panels or divided regions) separated by solid border rows of a uniform frame color, where each section contains multiple sub-panels divided by vertical frame lines, and the goal is to extract and output a specific sub-panel from each section based on rules tied to the section's position, resizing it to a standard 7-column width while preserving the frame borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts and ends with (and is separated by) full border rows consisting entirely of the frame color (e.g., all 4s), which act as dividers between sections; these must be copied verbatim to the output as 7-wide rows of frame color.
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell (or 0 if empty), assuming it's consistent across the grid; borders in sections are vertical lines of this color separating sub-panels.
 * Each non-border section has a variable number of sub-panels (num_panels = number of border positions - 1), identified by positions where the row hits the frame color; extraction targets a specific sub-panel index per section (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second, etc.), falling back to valid ranges if needed.
 * Sub-panel extraction slices content between left and right border positions, taking exactly the left border value, the first 5 content cells (to standardize width), and the right border value, resulting in 7-column rows; this is applied row-by-row for the entire section height until the next border row.
 * Sections without panels (no borders found) are skipped entirely, advancing past them without output.
 * Section index increments only after processing a valid section with panels, ensuring selection logic applies sequentially to content-bearing sections.
 * Subtle: Vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows (but code assumes they do for extraction); content may include colors like 8 (possibly inner frames or fillers) or 1 (patterns), which are preserved as-is without interpretation.
 * Easy to miss: Overly wide sections may have content beyond the 5-slice, leading to truncation; fallback logic (e.g., panel_idx = num_panels - 1 if out of range) prevents crashes but may select wrong panels; repetitive sections in input could lead to near-identical outputs if selection always picks similar sub-panels.
 * All attempts must handle empty grids (return empty list) and ensure output rows are exactly 7 elements; no rotation, flipping, or merging of extracted panels—output stacks them sequentially with borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Identifies the uniform frame color from top-left; essential for detecting borders and assuming consistency.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is a full horizontal border; key for section delimiting and copying borders to output.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1:right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```
(Cores extraction logic: grabs left/right borders and exactly 5 inner cells to standardize to 7 columns; handles variable widths by truncation, preserving frame values.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects which sub-panel to extract based on section order and panel count; includes fallbacks for varying num_panels, e.g., picks middle-ish or edge panels; crucial for puzzle's selection rule.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, correctly identifying frame color, detecting border rows, extracting the right sub-panel per section, and standardizing to 7 columns without errors.
 * The section-skipping logic for empty sections worked, as did incrementing section_idx only after valid extractions.
 * choose_panel_index handled specific cases (e.g., index 2 for first section, assuming at least 3 panels) with fallbacks, which aligned with training data.
 * extract_panel_row's 5-content slice correctly truncated wider panels, preserving borders as frame color.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes vertical borders align across section rows (uses first row's positions for all), which could fail if misaligned—though it worked for training.
 * get_frame_color and is_border_row are robust and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but prior attempts (implied) might have lacked fallback in choose_panel_index, causing index errors on low-panel sections.
 * Overall, core loop (while r < H, check border vs. section start) effectively parsed structure without overcomplicating.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 8 stacked sections (each ~7 rows high), starting/ending with full [4]*7 border rows, and inner sections showing 7-column panels with left/right 4 borders, inner 8s (likely filler or sub-frame), and patterns of 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], [4,8,1,8,8,1,4], etc.); sections are nearly identical, repeating the same 5-row pattern of 1/8 arrangements flanked by 8-filled rows.
 * This looks partially correct in structure (borders copied, extractions standardized to 7 columns, sections delimited), but suspicious due to high repetition—suggests the test input has multiple similar multi-panel sections (e.g., 4+ panels each), and the program consistently selected a sub-panel with 8-heavy content and simple 1 patterns, possibly the second or third panel if sections have 3+ panels.
 * It does not look fully correct because the patterns (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s or blobs) across the 5 content columns seem truncated or simplistic; expected output might combine or select varying sub-panels (e.g., alternating left/middle/right) to form a progressive puzzle image, but here all sections output near-identical panels, missing variety—possibly wrong panel selection for later sections (e.g., choose_panel_index's else clause picking edges too predictably).
 * The 8s as inner elements are preserved correctly (not treated as frames), but if the puzzle intends 8s as secondary borders, extraction might need nested slicing (not handled); output height matches multi-section input, but without the actual test grid, the repetition implies over-extraction or input similarity, differing from expected by lacking diversity in selected content.
 * Note: The output is different from a "correct" expectation of a single cohesive image or varied panel sequence; it's a stack of similar extracts, which may not solve the visual puzzle (e.g., if goal is to reveal a hidden picture by picking specific panels).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) structured as framed sections, likely resembling comic panels or divided images, where the task is to extract and output a specific 7-cell-wide panel from each section based on section index and number of panels, preserving frames and inner content while handling borders and varying panel counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows that are entirely one color (frame color, often 4), separating vertical sections; these must be copied as full 7-cell frame rows in output.
 * Within sections, panels are vertically aligned and separated by vertical frame-color columns (also 4); the number of panels is one less than the number of frame positions in a row.
 * Panel extraction takes the left and right frame cells, plus up to 5 inner content cells (sliced from left+1 to right, taking first 5), always outputting exactly 7 cells per row (pad with frame color if short, truncate if long, though grids seem designed to fit).
 * Panel selection depends on section index (0-based, incrementing per section) and number of panels: e.g., section 0 picks the 3rd panel (index 2), section 1 picks first (0), section 2 picks middle (1) or last if not 3 panels, later sections alternate first/last based on parity.
 * Frame color is determined from top-left cell; assume consistent across grid.
 * Sections must be detected by transitioning from border to non-border rows; invalid sections (no panels) are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Ensure bounds checking to avoid index errors; content rows may have varying widths but extraction assumes W is consistent; repeated identical sections in test suggest symmetric or patterned input, but selection logic must handle varying num_panels (e.g., 2 vs 3 panels changes section 2 choice).
 * Easy to miss: Padding only with frame color if under 7; not all sections have the same num_panels, so min() clamp in panel_idx prevents overflow; vertical alignment assumes all rows in section have same border positions.
 * Overall output maintains section structure with extracted panels "zoomed" to 7-wide, including top/bottom borders as full frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This reliably detects the frame color from top-left, assuming consistent framing.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Essential for identifying and copying full border rows; simple and accurate.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    return [row[left]] + content + [row[right]]
```
(Core extraction logic; correctly grabs frames + limited inner content to fit 7-wide; add padding/truncation in main function as needed.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Panel selection rule; handles special cases for early sections and alternates for later ones; clamping with min(panel_idx, num_panels-1) prevents errors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic section detection, border copying, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely simpler grids with 2-3 panels and fewer sections).
 * Worked well for frame color detection and border row identification, as training passed without errors.
 * Panel extraction via extract_panel_row produced correct 7-wide outputs with frames intact for training.
 * choose_panel_index correctly selected panels for early sections (0,1,2) in training, suggesting the rules match those examples.
 * Did not fail on bounds or empty grids in training, showing robust in_section tracking and skipping.
 * However, for more complex cases like the test (multiple identical sections), it may over-rely on assuming consistent num_panels; if test has varying panels per section, selection could pick wrong (e.g., index 2 invalid if only 2 panels).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, etc.) are relevant and worked for training—none are broken, but main loop could improve section ending detection if borders are missed.
 * Overall, core structure (while loop scanning rows, starting sections on non-borders) is solid but untested on repetition or asymmetry.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 4 repeated sections (each: top border [4]*7, 6 content rows like [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] down to patterns with 1s, bottom border [4]*7), followed by an extra border, totaling ~29 rows with identical content across sections.
 * This suggests the program detected 4 sections, extracted the same panel (likely index 0 or leftmost, given consistent starting 4,8,... patterns) from each, assuming num_panels >=2 and sections have identical inner content (8 as background, 1 as details like shapes or letters).
 * The output makes sense structurally (preserves frames, 7-wide, section separation) and matches extraction rules: e.g., first content [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] implies 5 inner 8s from a wider panel; later rows show sliced content like [8,1,1,8,1] which could be partial shapes.
 * However, repetition of identical sections implies the input grid has symmetric or tiled content, but if choose_panel_index intended variety (e.g., section 0 picks index 2/middle, section 1 picks 0/left), the identical output suggests either all sections have 3+ panels with middle identical to left, or logic fell back to left (e.g., due to num_panels=2 clamping index 2 to 1, but still same if symmetric).
 * It does not look fully correct if the puzzle expects different panels per section (e.g., varying images); the uniformity might miss subtle differences in input panels, or fail to alternate properly for later sections (idx 3 should pick last if even). Unknown why identical—possibly input is repetitive, but expected output should show progression/variation if selecting different panels.
 * Positive: No crashes or invalid rows; patterns like [8,1,1,8,1] resemble sliced comic elements (e.g., letters 'B' or shapes in 1s), so extraction works, but verify if it matches expected by mentally simulating: if test input has 3 panels per section with distinct content, output should differ across sections, not repeat identically.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Finds vertical border column positions in the first non-border row of the current section."""
    frame_c = get_frame_color(g)
    r = 0
    H = len(g)
    while r < H and is_border_row(g[r], frame_c):
        r += 1
    if r == H:
        return []
    row = g[r]
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_starts_and_rights(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left-start and right-end positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided data across all examples (train inputs/outputs and test inputs), I identified only obvious, direct interactions or connections between components/properties that are consistent in **every** case. These are limited to structural relationships (e.g., containment via bbox overlap) and property correlations (e.g., counts) that hold universally without variation or exceptions. I ignored any high-level patterns, semantic meanings (e.g., tetromino types), or transformations, as instructed. No forced explanations—where a connection (e.g., exact pixel causation) cannot be directly tied consistently, I note it as unknown. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., varying colors, inconsistent pixel totals, or non-interacting singletons) are excluded. Only interactions present in 100% of the examples are listed.

#### 1. **Background ↔ Containers (Encompassment and Hole Count Correlation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Background (large single object: full-image bbox like [0,0,W,H], high holes=9–16, low-to-medium pixels=58–265, colors vary: blue/green/yellow/blue). Containers (multiple medium objects: bbox span ~4–6 units, holes=1, pixels=18–25, colors vary: pink/yellow/maroon/green).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: The background's bbox fully encompasses all containers' bboxes (no container extends beyond background bounds). The background's `holes` property directly equals the total count of container objects (e.g., holes=9 with 9 containers; holes=12 with 12; holes=16 with 16; holes=3 with 3). This holds positionally (containers embedded within background) and quantitatively (hole count as a 1:1 match to container count).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example (all inputs and outputs). No exceptions.
   - **Unknowns**: Causation unclear (e.g., whether containers "create" background holes via position or shape—cannot confirm consistently without solving).

#### 2. **Containers ↔ Small Shapes (Containment via Bbox Nesting)**
   - **Components Involved**: Containers (as above). Small shapes (multiple low-size objects: bbox span ~1–4 units, holes=0, pixels=1–11, colors vary: yellow/blue/maroon; these are the non-background, non-container filled regions).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: Each container's bbox strictly contains (nests) at least one small shape's bbox entirely within it (shape min/max coords subset of container's; no shape spans multiple containers or escapes its container). Small shapes do not interact with each other directly (no bbox overlap between shapes). Containers have holes=1, while contained shapes have holes=0 (consistent property contrast enabling nesting).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example (all inputs and outputs). Every container has at least one nested shape; no un-nested shapes or empty containers.
   - **Unknowns**: Exact number of shapes per container is not always 1 (e.g., some have multiple disconnected shape components, as in test input 2); total shape pixels per container varies (4–11 total, but no consistent sum relation to container pixels). Pixel count or bbox size of shapes does not consistently affect container properties (e.g., no fixed delta).

#### 3. **Grid Position → Container/Small Shape Bbox (Positional Determination)**
   - **Components Involved**: Containers and small shapes (as above). Implicit grid (inferred from bbox coords: regular spacing ~6 units horizontally/vertically, e.g., container starts at x~1/7/8/13/15/19/22, y~1/7/8/13/15/19/22).
   - **Interaction/Connection**: A container's absolute grid position (row/column index, derived from its bbox start coords) determines both its own bbox size/span (~4–6 units, fixed per grid) and the relative bbox of its nested small shape (shape's offset/span within container varies predictably by grid position, e.g., top-row containers often have shapes with y-span starting near container min-y; left-column with x-span near min-x). This creates a position-to-bbox mapping (e.g., column 1 positions always yield shapes with x-start ~2 relative to container x=1).
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example (all inputs and outputs). All bboxes align to the same ~6-unit grid spacing; relative shape bboxes within containers follow position-based patterns without deviation (e.g., no random offsets).
   - **Unknowns**: Specific mapping rule (e.g., exact row/col → relative x/y offset or span size) cannot be explained without transformation details—position affects bbox but how/why is unknown. No consistent effect on other properties (e.g., position → pixels or holes is absent).

No other interactions (e.g., color-to-position, pixels-to-holes, or shape-to-background direct effects) are consistent across every example—variations in colors, pixel counts, and minor bbox anomalies (e.g., rare small extra objects) prevent inclusion. No total solution or broader understanding inferred.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:19:05] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where a large grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows (all one color), and each section contains multiple vertical panels defined by frame-colored borders; the goal is to extract a specific 7-column-wide panel from each section based on the section's index, including borders and up to 5 content cells, then output these panels in sequence with horizontal borders preserved, padding short rows to exactly 7 columns with the frame color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 4 in the test output); all borders (horizontal full rows and vertical panel dividers) use this color, but content uses other values (e.g., 8 as filler/background, 1 as distinct elements).
 * Horizontal borders are full rows of frame color only; content sections are contiguous rows between them without full frame rows.
 * In content rows, vertical borders are positions where frame color appears; panels are defined between consecutive border positions (left border + content + right border).
 * Panel selection is deterministic per section index: e.g., 3rd panel (index 2) for section 0, 1st (index 0) for section 1, middle or last for section 2 depending on count, and alternating first/last for later sections—ensuring index doesn't exceed available panels.
 * Extraction per row: Slice from chosen left border to right border, include left/right values, take up to 5 content cells between them; if the slice yields fewer than 7 total columns, pad right with frame color (subtle: never truncate if more than 5 content, but cap content at 5 to fit 7-wide).
 * Sections must have at least 2 border positions to be valid; skip invalid ones.
 * Output preserves structure: full 7-wide frame rows for horizontal borders, and 7-wide panel rows for content sections.
 * Easy to miss: Padding only happens if <7 after extraction (e.g., narrow panels); assume consistent grid width, but panels may vary; section indexing starts at 0 and increments after each content block.
 * Content may include non-frame colors like 8 (possibly background) and 1 (patterns/objects); extraction should preserve these exactly without alteration.
 * Global considerations: Empty grid returns empty; handle variable panel counts per section; no vertical borders in output beyond the chosen panel's left/right.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color, indicating a horizontal border."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds all column indices in the row where the frame color appears, indicating vertical borders."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects the panel index to extract based on the section index and number of panels in the section."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    """Extracts a 7-column slice for the panel: left border + up to 5 content cells + right border."""
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; the program correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, accurately detecting frame color, borders, sections, and panel selection to produce valid outputs.
 * Worked: Proper sectioning with horizontal border detection and skipping invalid sections; consistent 7-wide extraction with padding; panel index choice handled variable num_panels and clamped to valid range.
 * Did not work (or potentially): In the test, the program produced identical panel patterns across all four sections (each a 6-row block of 4/8/1 patterns), which suggests it may be selecting panels with identical content or failing to vary selection correctly if the input panels differ—unknown without input grid, but repetition implies possible bug in section_idx increment or border detection if sections aren't truly identical.
 * choose_panel_index is essential and seems correct for varying selections (e.g., index 2 for section 0, 0 for 1, etc.), but if test has >3 panels or non-3, the logic for section 2+ might not align if panels differ.
 * extract_panel_row is helpful for precise slicing but caps content at 5, which worked for training; however, if test panels have >5 content cells, it truncates them (subtle omission: may lose data if panels are wide).
 * get_border_positions assumes all frame occurrences are borders, which worked for training but could misfire if frame color appears in content (not seen in outputs).
 * Overall, core logic demonstrates understanding of bordering and extraction, but test repetition hints at over-simplification or input-specific issue (e.g., all sections having symmetric panels).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks: each starts with a 7-wide horizontal border of [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], followed by 6 content rows of a consistent 7-wide panel pattern (borders 4, background 8s, and 1s in positions forming a shape like a figure-8 or connected blobs: e.g., row2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]), ending with another border; the entire output is 29 rows, symmetric and repetitive.
 * This does not look fully correct because the identical patterns across sections suggest the program is extracting the same panel type (e.g., always a middle or similar panel with the 8/1 shape) from potentially different input sections—if the test input has varying panels per section (as implied by puzzle needing specific index selection), the output should show different 1-patterns or contents per block, not repetition; the sameness indicates possible failure to detect unique vertical borders or apply varying panel_idx correctly.
 * The patterns themselves make sense internally (preserved colors, exact 7-width, padding not needed as slices fit), but the lack of variation across sections is suspicious and differs from expected diversity in a multi-section puzzle; unknown if input is symmetric, but it feels like over-extraction of one panel archetype.
 * No empty or skipped sections apparent, and borders are correctly output as full 4s, but if test has 3+ panels per section, the choice logic (e.g., index 2 for first section) might be pulling the same shaped panel each time coincidentally.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 20:19:13] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements across **all provided examples** (train inputs/outputs 1-2 and test inputs 1-2). These are limited to properties/components that appear in every example with the same relational behavior (e.g., positional containment, quantity linkage, or structural embedding). I ignored:
- Any high-level puzzle solving or total understanding.
- Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the single-pixel Maroon/Green outliers in test input 2, small anomalous Blues in test input 1 bottom-right, or the Maroon with holes=2 in test input 1, as they lack consistent interaction across all examples).
- Inconsistent or forced connections (e.g., no reliable color-to-color mapping, as colors vary without pattern; no consistent pixel transformation explanation beyond minor left-column adjustments in train outputs; no universal height/width scaling, as bbox heights vary 18-28 without fixed relation).
- Elements without interaction (e.g., rightmost column shapes/backgrounds are structurally similar but not interconnected to left column or large shape in a unique way across all).
- Output-specific transformations beyond what's directly observable and consistent in both train examples (e.g., the large shape's output bbox/pixels/holes=3 is fixed in trains but unobservable in tests, so noted as "unknown" for broader consistency; row count varies 3-4, preventing a fixed "holes = rows" link).

Interactions are described as property A -> effect/interaction on property B, with evidence of consistency.

1. **Small foreground shape position -> containment within small background square**  
   - Description: Each small foreground shape (holes=0, pixels=4-11, bbox size ~2-5 units wide/tall) is positioned entirely inside a corresponding small background square's bbox (overlapping but not exceeding boundaries). The foreground is offset inward (e.g., ~1 unit from edges) and roughly centered relative to the background.  
   - Properties involved: Foreground bbox coordinates (e.g., [2,2,4,4]) subset of background bbox (e.g., [1,1,5,5]); no escape or external overlap.  
   - Consistency: Occurs in every grid cell across all examples (e.g., train 1: Yellow fg in Pink bg; train 2: Blue fg in Yellow bg; test 1: Blue fg in Maroon bg; test 2: Maroon fg in Green bg). No exceptions in standard cells.  
   - Effect: Creates contrasting fill inside the background (pixels of fg reduce effective fill in bg, contributing to bg's holes=1).

2. **Small background square holes/pixels -> single connected hole influenced by foreground shape**  
   - Description: Each small background square has exactly holes=1 (except rare anomalies ignored for consistency), with pixel count ~18-25 in a ~5x5-6x6 bbox, where the hole=1 is a single connected empty region shaped around/around the contained foreground shape.  
   - Properties involved: Background holes=1 directly tied to foreground presence (fg pixels "punch" or define the hole's boundary); pixel count varies slightly (e.g., 19-20) but consistently less than full bbox area (~25), leaving space for the hole.  
   - Consistency: Every standard small background in all examples follows this (e.g., Pink/Yellow/Maroon/Green bgs all holes=1 with internal fg defining the hole). No background lacks a fg or has holes=0.  
   - Effect: Foreground shape properties (e.g., its bbox edges/silhouette) determine the background's hole geometry (e.g., L/Y/H-like negative space).

3. **Small background square positions -> grid layout defining columns and rows**  
   - Description: Small background squares are arranged in a regular grid of 3-4 rows and 3-4 columns, with fixed horizontal/vertical spacing (~2 units gap between adjacent bgs, e.g., x1-5 then x7-11; y1-5 then y7-11). Each row/column aligns foreground shapes similarly.  
   - Properties involved: Background bbox left/ top edges define grid positions (e.g., left column always starts at x~1, width~5; rows stacked with y gaps).  
   - Consistency: All examples show this grid structure (train 1: 3 cols x 3 rows; train 2/test 2: 4 cols x 3-4 rows; test 1: 4 cols x 4 rows). Gaps and alignments are uniform.  
   - Effect: Positions propagate to foregrounds (each fg mirrors its bg's row/col position) and bound the large shape's coverage.

4. **Number of small background squares -> holes count in large encompassing shape**  
   - Description: The large shape's holes count is directly determined by (approximately equal to) the total number of small background squares in the grid. Each background contributes ~1 hole via positional overlap.  
   - Properties involved: Large holes (9/12/16) ≈ count of small bgs (9/12/16); exact in trains (9=9, 12=12), near-exact in tests (16≈16, minor discrepancy in test 1 due to one bg's holes=2 possibly overcounting by 1).  
   - Consistency: Present in every example; no large shape without this linkage to bg count.  
   - Effect: Small bgs "punch" holes in the large shape at their grid positions (bboxes of bgs align with hole locations in large).

5. **Large encompassing shape bbox -> coverage of all small backgrounds and foregrounds**  
   - Description: The large shape's bbox fully encompasses all small backgrounds and their contained foregrounds, with no small elements outside it.  
   - Properties involved: Large bbox (e.g., [0,0,18,18]) spans from min (0,0) to max extent of grid (~17-27); small bbs/fgs are internal subsets.  
   - Consistency: Every example has one large shape covering the entire grid (e.g., train 1 Blue [0,0,18,18]; test 1 Yellow [0,0,28,28]).  
   - Effect: Positions of small bgs/fgs are relative to large bbox origin; large pixels (~136-265) reduced by combined pixels of all small bgs (~20 each).

6. **Leftmost column small backgrounds/foregrounds -> preservation with minor pixel/bbox adjustment (in train outputs)**  
   - Description: In train outputs, only the leftmost column's foreground shapes and backgrounds are retained, with small consistent tweaks (e.g., pixels ±1-2, minor bbox height shift in bottom row). Other columns are removed.  
   - Properties involved: Left column bbs (e.g., x1-5/6) unchanged in x/y start; pixels adjusted slightly (e.g., train 1: fg pixels 5→6, bg 20→19); order listed top-to-bottom.  
   - Consistency: Exact in both train outputs (train 1: 3 fgs + 3 bgs from left; train 2: 3 fgs + 3 bgs from left). Presumed structural in tests (left column exists identically, but transformation unobservable). No right column elements preserved.  
   - Effect: Creates a "vertical stack" subset (3x1) from the left column, isolating it from the full grid.

7. **Large shape in train outputs -> cropped to left strip with reduced holes/pixels (unknown full mechanism)**  
   - Description: In train outputs, the large shape is cropped to left width=6 ([0,0,6,18]), holes reduced to 3 (from left column bgs only), pixels fixed at 58, color unchanged. Height remains input height (18).  
   - Properties involved: Input holes (9/12) → output holes=3 (matches left column row count=3); bbox x-max reduced to 6 (aligns with left column width); pixels ~136/175 →58 (consistent fixed value, possibly merged left bgs' area minus fgs).  
   - Consistency: Identical in both train outputs (Blue/Green color preserved; holes=3, pixels=58, width=6). Unobservable in tests (different row counts/heights may alter to holes=4/pixels variable, but core cropping to left not contradicted).  
   - Effect: Links to left column selection (#6); reduces large holes to match left bgs only (3 contributions). Unknown: exact pixel calc (consistent 58 but unexplained; not scalable to test heights 24/28).

[2025-10-01 20:20:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

    content_end = right

    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured like framed sections (e.g., comic panels or divided regions) separated by solid border rows of a uniform frame color, where each section contains multiple sub-panels divided by vertical frame lines, and the goal is to extract and output a specific sub-panel from each section based on rules tied to the section's position, resizing it to a standard 7-column width while preserving the frame borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts and ends with (and is separated by) full border rows consisting entirely of the frame color (e.g., all 4s), which act as dividers between sections; these must be copied verbatim to the output as 7-wide rows of frame color.
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell (or 0 if empty), assuming it's consistent across the grid; borders in sections are vertical lines of this color separating sub-panels.
 * Each non-border section has a variable number of sub-panels (num_panels = number of border positions - 1), identified by positions where the row hits the frame color; extraction targets a specific sub-panel index per section (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second, etc.), falling back to valid ranges if needed.
 * Sub-panel extraction slices content between left and right border positions, taking exactly the left border value, the first 5 content cells (to standardize width), and the right border value, resulting in 7-column rows; this is applied row-by-row for the entire section height until the next border row.
 * Sections without panels (no borders found) are skipped entirely, advancing past them without output.
 * Section index increments only after processing a valid section with panels, ensuring selection logic applies sequentially to content-bearing sections.
 * Subtle: Vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows (but code assumes they do for extraction); content may include colors like 8 (possibly inner frames or fillers) or 1 (patterns), which are preserved as-is without interpretation.
 * Easy to miss: Overly wide sections may have content beyond the 5-slice, leading to truncation; fallback logic (e.g., panel_idx = num_panels - 1 if out of range) prevents crashes but may select wrong panels; repetitive sections in input could lead to near-identical outputs if selection always picks similar sub-panels.
 * All attempts must handle empty grids (return empty list) and ensure output rows are exactly 7 elements; no rotation, flipping, or merging of extracted panels—output stacks them sequentially with borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Identifies the uniform frame color from top-left; essential for detecting borders and assuming consistency.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is a full horizontal border; key for section delimiting and copying borders to output.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1:right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```
(Cores extraction logic: grabs left/right borders and exactly 5 inner cells to standardize to 7 columns; handles variable widths by truncation, preserving frame values.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects which sub-panel to extract based on section order and panel count; includes fallbacks for varying num_panels, e.g., picks middle-ish or edge panels; crucial for puzzle's selection rule.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, correctly identifying frame color, detecting border rows, extracting the right sub-panel per section, and standardizing to 7 columns without errors.
 * The section-skipping logic for empty sections worked, as did incrementing section_idx only after valid extractions.
 * choose_panel_index handled specific cases (e.g., index 2 for first section, assuming at least 3 panels) with fallbacks, which aligned with training data.
 * extract_panel_row's 5-content slice correctly truncated wider panels, preserving borders as frame color.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes vertical borders align across section rows (uses first row's positions for all), which could fail if misaligned—though it worked for training.
 * get_frame_color and is_border_row are robust and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but prior attempts (implied) might have lacked fallback in choose_panel_index, causing index errors on low-panel sections.
 * Overall, core loop (while r < H, check border vs. section start) effectively parsed structure without overcomplicating.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 8 stacked sections (each ~7 rows high), starting/ending with full [4]*7 border rows, and inner sections showing 7-column panels with left/right 4 borders, inner 8s (likely filler or sub-frame), and patterns of 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], [4,8,1,8,8,1,4], etc.); sections are nearly identical, repeating the same 5-row pattern of 1/8 arrangements flanked by 8-filled rows.
 * This looks partially correct in structure (borders copied, extractions standardized to 7 columns, sections delimited), but suspicious due to high repetition—suggests the test input has multiple similar multi-panel sections (e.g., 4+ panels each), and the program consistently selected a sub-panel with 8-heavy content and simple 1 patterns, possibly the second or third panel if sections have 3+ panels.
 * It does not look fully correct because the patterns (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s or blobs) across the 5 content columns seem truncated or simplistic; expected output might combine or select varying sub-panels (e.g., alternating left/middle/right) to form a progressive puzzle image, but here all sections output near-identical panels, missing variety—possibly wrong panel selection for later sections (e.g., choose_panel_index's else clause picking edges too predictably).
 * The 8s as inner elements are preserved correctly (not treated as frames), but if the puzzle intends 8s as secondary borders, extraction might need nested slicing (not handled); output height matches multi-section input, but without the actual test grid, the repetition implies over-extraction or input similarity, differing from expected by lacking diversity in selected content.
 * Note: The output is different from a "correct" expectation of a single cohesive image or varied panel sequence; it's a stack of similar extracts, which may not solve the visual puzzle (e.g., if goal is to reveal a hidden picture by picking specific panels).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) structured as framed sections, likely resembling comic panels or divided images, where the task is to extract and output a specific 7-cell-wide panel from each section based on section index and number of panels, preserving frames and inner content while handling borders and varying panel counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows that are entirely one color (frame color, often 4), separating vertical sections; these must be copied as full 7-cell frame rows in output.
 * Within sections, panels are vertically aligned and separated by vertical frame-color columns (also 4); the number of panels is one less than the number of frame positions in a row.
 * Panel extraction takes the left and right frame cells, plus up to 5 inner content cells (sliced from left+1 to right, taking first 5), always outputting exactly 7 cells per row (pad with frame color if short, truncate if long, though grids seem designed to fit).
 * Panel selection depends on section index (0-based, incrementing per section) and number of panels: e.g., section 0 picks the 3rd panel (index 2), section 1 picks first (0), section 2 picks middle (1) or last if not 3 panels, later sections alternate first/last based on parity.
 * Frame color is determined from top-left cell; assume consistent across grid.
 * Sections must be detected by transitioning from border to non-border rows; invalid sections (no panels) are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Ensure bounds checking to avoid index errors; content rows may have varying widths but extraction assumes W is consistent; repeated identical sections in test suggest symmetric or patterned input, but selection logic must handle varying num_panels (e.g., 2 vs 3 panels changes section 2 choice).
 * Easy to miss: Padding only with frame color if under 7; not all sections have the same num_panels, so min() clamp in panel_idx prevents overflow; vertical alignment assumes all rows in section have same border positions.
 * Overall output maintains section structure with extracted panels "zoomed" to 7-wide, including top/bottom borders as full frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This reliably detects the frame color from top-left, assuming consistent framing.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Essential for identifying and copying full border rows; simple and accurate.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    return [row[left]] + content + [row[right]]
```
(Core extraction logic; correctly grabs frames + limited inner content to fit 7-wide; add padding/truncation in main function as needed.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Panel selection rule; handles special cases for early sections and alternates for later ones; clamping with min(panel_idx, num_panels-1) prevents errors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic section detection, border copying, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely simpler grids with 2-3 panels and fewer sections).
 * Worked well for frame color detection and border row identification, as training passed without errors.
 * Panel extraction via extract_panel_row produced correct 7-wide outputs with frames intact for training.
 * choose_panel_index correctly selected panels for early sections (0,1,2) in training, suggesting the rules match those examples.
 * Did not fail on bounds or empty grids in training, showing robust in_section tracking and skipping.
 * However, for more complex cases like the test (multiple identical sections), it may over-rely on assuming consistent num_panels; if test has varying panels per section, selection could pick wrong (e.g., index 2 invalid if only 2 panels).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, etc.) are relevant and worked for training—none are broken, but main loop could improve section ending detection if borders are missed.
 * Overall, core structure (while loop scanning rows, starting sections on non-borders) is solid but untested on repetition or asymmetry.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 4 repeated sections (each: top border [4]*7, 6 content rows like [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] down to patterns with 1s, bottom border [4]*7), followed by an extra border, totaling ~29 rows with identical content across sections.
 * This suggests the program detected 4 sections, extracted the same panel (likely index 0 or leftmost, given consistent starting 4,8,... patterns) from each, assuming num_panels >=2 and sections have identical inner content (8 as background, 1 as details like shapes or letters).
 * The output makes sense structurally (preserves frames, 7-wide, section separation) and matches extraction rules: e.g., first content [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] implies 5 inner 8s from a wider panel; later rows show sliced content like [8,1,1,8,1] which could be partial shapes.
 * However, repetition of identical sections implies the input grid has symmetric or tiled content, but if choose_panel_index intended variety (e.g., section 0 picks index 2/middle, section 1 picks 0/left), the identical output suggests either all sections have 3+ panels with middle identical to left, or logic fell back to left (e.g., due to num_panels=2 clamping index 2 to 1, but still same if symmetric).
 * It does not look fully correct if the puzzle expects different panels per section (e.g., varying images); the uniformity might miss subtle differences in input panels, or fail to alternate properly for later sections (idx 3 should pick last if even). Unknown why identical—possibly input is repetitive, but expected output should show progression/variation if selecting different panels.
 * Positive: No crashes or invalid rows; patterns like [8,1,1,8,1] resemble sliced comic elements (e.g., letters 'B' or shapes in 1s), so extraction works, but verify if it matches expected by mentally simulating: if test input has 3 panels per section with distinct content, output should differ across sections, not repeat identically.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where a large grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows (all one color), and each section contains multiple vertical panels defined by frame-colored borders; the goal is to extract a specific 7-column-wide panel from each section based on the section's index, including borders and up to 5 content cells, then output these panels in sequence with horizontal borders preserved, padding short rows to exactly 7 columns with the frame color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 4 in the test output); all borders (horizontal full rows and vertical panel dividers) use this color, but content uses other values (e.g., 8 as filler/background, 1 as distinct elements).
 * Horizontal borders are full rows of frame color only; content sections are contiguous rows between them without full frame rows.
 * In content rows, vertical borders are positions where frame color appears; panels are defined between consecutive border positions (left border + content + right border).
 * Panel selection is deterministic per section index: e.g., 3rd panel (index 2) for section 0, 1st (index 0) for section 1, middle or last for section 2 depending on count, and alternating first/last for later sections—ensuring index doesn't exceed available panels.
 * Extraction per row: Slice from chosen left border to right border, include left/right values, take up to 5 content cells between them; if the slice yields fewer than 7 total columns, pad right with frame color (subtle: never truncate if more than 5 content, but cap content at 5 to fit 7-wide).
 * Sections must have at least 2 border positions to be valid; skip invalid ones.
 * Output preserves structure: full 7-wide frame rows for horizontal borders, and 7-wide panel rows for content sections.
 * Easy to miss: Padding only happens if <7 after extraction (e.g., narrow panels); assume consistent grid width, but panels may vary; section indexing starts at 0 and increments after each content block.
 * Content may include non-frame colors like 8 (possibly background) and 1 (patterns/objects); extraction should preserve these exactly without alteration.
 * Global considerations: Empty grid returns empty; handle variable panel counts per section; no vertical borders in output beyond the chosen panel's left/right.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; the program correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, accurately detecting frame color, borders, sections, and panel selection to produce valid outputs.
 * Worked: Proper sectioning with horizontal border detection and skipping invalid sections; consistent 7-wide extraction with padding; panel index choice handled variable num_panels and clamped to valid range.
 * Did not work (or potentially): In the test, the program produced identical panel patterns across all four sections (each a 6-row block of 4/8/1 patterns), which suggests it may be selecting panels with identical content or failing to vary selection correctly if the input panels differ—unknown without input grid, but repetition implies possible bug in section_idx increment or border detection if sections aren't truly identical.
 * choose_panel_index is essential and seems correct for varying selections (e.g., index 2 for section 0, 0 for 1, etc.), but if test has >3 panels or non-3, the logic for section 2+ might not align if panels differ.
 * extract_panel_row is helpful for precise slicing but caps content at 5, which worked for training; however, if test panels have >5 content cells, it truncates them (subtle omission: may lose data if panels are wide).
 * get_border_positions assumes all frame occurrences are borders, which worked for training but could misfire if frame color appears in content (not seen in outputs).
 * Overall, core logic demonstrates understanding of bordering and extraction, but test repetition hints at over-simplification or input-specific issue (e.g., all sections having symmetric panels).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks: each starts with a 7-wide horizontal border of [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], followed by 6 content rows of a consistent 7-wide panel pattern (borders 4, background 8s, and 1s in positions forming a shape like a figure-8 or connected blobs: e.g., row2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]), ending with another border; the entire output is 29 rows, symmetric and repetitive.
 * This does not look fully correct because the identical patterns across sections suggest the program is extracting the same panel type (e.g., always a middle or similar panel with the 8/1 shape) from potentially different input sections—if the test input has varying panels per section (as implied by puzzle needing specific index selection), the output should show different 1-patterns or contents per block, not repetition; the sameness indicates possible failure to detect unique vertical borders or apply varying panel_idx correctly.
 * The patterns themselves make sense internally (preserved colors, exact 7-width, padding not needed as slices fit), but the lack of variation across sections is suspicious and differs from expected diversity in a multi-section puzzle; unknown if input is symmetric, but it feels like over-extraction of one panel archetype.
 * No empty or skipped sections apparent, and borders are correctly output as full 4s, but if test has 3+ panels per section, the choice logic (e.g., index 2 for first section) might be pulling the same shaped panel each time coincidentally.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements across **all provided examples** (train inputs/outputs 1-2 and test inputs 1-2). These are limited to properties/components that appear in every example with the same relational behavior (e.g., positional containment, quantity linkage, or structural embedding). I ignored:
- Any high-level puzzle solving or total understanding.
- Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., the single-pixel Maroon/Green outliers in test input 2, small anomalous Blues in test input 1 bottom-right, or the Maroon with holes=2 in test input 1, as they lack consistent interaction across all examples).
- Inconsistent or forced connections (e.g., no reliable color-to-color mapping, as colors vary without pattern; no consistent pixel transformation explanation beyond minor left-column adjustments in train outputs; no universal height/width scaling, as bbox heights vary 18-28 without fixed relation).
- Elements without interaction (e.g., rightmost column shapes/backgrounds are structurally similar but not interconnected to left column or large shape in a unique way across all).
- Output-specific transformations beyond what's directly observable and consistent in both train examples (e.g., the large shape's output bbox/pixels/holes=3 is fixed in trains but unobservable in tests, so noted as "unknown" for broader consistency; row count varies 3-4, preventing a fixed "holes = rows" link).

Interactions are described as property A -> effect/interaction on property B, with evidence of consistency.

1. **Small foreground shape position -> containment within small background square**  
   - Description: Each small foreground shape (holes=0, pixels=4-11, bbox size ~2-5 units wide/tall) is positioned entirely inside a corresponding small background square's bbox (overlapping but not exceeding boundaries). The foreground is offset inward (e.g., ~1 unit from edges) and roughly centered relative to the background.  
   - Properties involved: Foreground bbox coordinates (e.g., [2,2,4,4]) subset of background bbox (e.g., [1,1,5,5]); no escape or external overlap.  
   - Consistency: Occurs in every grid cell across all examples (e.g., train 1: Yellow fg in Pink bg; train 2: Blue fg in Yellow bg; test 1: Blue fg in Maroon bg; test 2: Maroon fg in Green bg). No exceptions in standard cells.  
   - Effect: Creates contrasting fill inside the background (pixels of fg reduce effective fill in bg, contributing to bg's holes=1).

2. **Small background square holes/pixels -> single connected hole influenced by foreground shape**  
   - Description: Each small background square has exactly holes=1 (except rare anomalies ignored for consistency), with pixel count ~18-25 in a ~5x5-6x6 bbox, where the hole=1 is a single connected empty region shaped around/around the contained foreground shape.  
   - Properties involved: Background holes=1 directly tied to foreground presence (fg pixels "punch" or define the hole's boundary); pixel count varies slightly (e.g., 19-20) but consistently less than full bbox area (~25), leaving space for the hole.  
   - Consistency: Every standard small background in all examples follows this (e.g., Pink/Yellow/Maroon/Green bgs all holes=1 with internal fg defining the hole). No background lacks a fg or has holes=0.  
   - Effect: Foreground shape properties (e.g., its bbox edges/silhouette) determine the background's hole geometry (e.g., L/Y/H-like negative space).

3. **Small background square positions -> grid layout defining columns and rows**  
   - Description: Small background squares are arranged in a regular grid of 3-4 rows and 3-4 columns, with fixed horizontal/vertical spacing (~2 units gap between adjacent bgs, e.g., x1-5 then x7-11; y1-5 then y7-11). Each row/column aligns foreground shapes similarly.  
   - Properties involved: Background bbox left/ top edges define grid positions (e.g., left column always starts at x~1, width~5; rows stacked with y gaps).  
   - Consistency: All examples show this grid structure (train 1: 3 cols x 3 rows; train 2/test 2: 4 cols x 3-4 rows; test 1: 4 cols x 4 rows). Gaps and alignments are uniform.  
   - Effect: Positions propagate to foregrounds (each fg mirrors its bg's row/col position) and bound the large shape's coverage.

4. **Number of small background squares -> holes count in large encompassing shape**  
   - Description: The large shape's holes count is directly determined by (approximately equal to) the total number of small background squares in the grid. Each background contributes ~1 hole via positional overlap.  
   - Properties involved: Large holes (9/12/16) ≈ count of small bgs (9/12/16); exact in trains (9=9, 12=12), near-exact in tests (16≈16, minor discrepancy in test 1 due to one bg's holes=2 possibly overcounting by 1).  
   - Consistency: Present in every example; no large shape without this linkage to bg count.  
   - Effect: Small bgs "punch" holes in the large shape at their grid positions (bboxes of bgs align with hole locations in large).

5. **Large encompassing shape bbox -> coverage of all small backgrounds and foregrounds**  
   - Description: The large shape's bbox fully encompasses all small backgrounds and their contained foregrounds, with no small elements outside it.  
   - Properties involved: Large bbox (e.g., [0,0,18,18]) spans from min (0,0) to max extent of grid (~17-27); small bbs/fgs are internal subsets.  
   - Consistency: Every example has one large shape covering the entire grid (e.g., train 1 Blue [0,0,18,18]; test 1 Yellow [0,0,28,28]).  
   - Effect: Positions of small bgs/fgs are relative to large bbox origin; large pixels (~136-265) reduced by combined pixels of all small bgs (~20 each).

6. **Leftmost column small backgrounds/foregrounds -> preservation with minor pixel/bbox adjustment (in train outputs)**  
   - Description: In train outputs, only the leftmost column's foreground shapes and backgrounds are retained, with small consistent tweaks (e.g., pixels ±1-2, minor bbox height shift in bottom row). Other columns are removed.  
   - Properties involved: Left column bbs (e.g., x1-5/6) unchanged in x/y start; pixels adjusted slightly (e.g., train 1: fg pixels 5→6, bg 20→19); order listed top-to-bottom.  
   - Consistency: Exact in both train outputs (train 1: 3 fgs + 3 bgs from left; train 2: 3 fgs + 3 bgs from left). Presumed structural in tests (left column exists identically, but transformation unobservable). No right column elements preserved.  
   - Effect: Creates a "vertical stack" subset (3x1) from the left column, isolating it from the full grid.

7. **Large shape in train outputs -> cropped to left strip with reduced holes/pixels (unknown full mechanism)**  
   - Description: In train outputs, the large shape is cropped to left width=6 ([0,0,6,18]), holes reduced to 3 (from left column bgs only), pixels fixed at 58, color unchanged. Height remains input height (18).  
   - Properties involved: Input holes (9/12) → output holes=3 (matches left column row count=3); bbox x-max reduced to 6 (aligns with left column width); pixels ~136/175 →58 (consistent fixed value, possibly merged left bgs' area minus fgs).  
   - Consistency: Identical in both train outputs (Blue/Green color preserved; holes=3, pixels=58, width=6). Unobservable in tests (different row counts/heights may alter to holes=4/pixels variable, but core cropping to left not contradicted).  
   - Effect: Links to left column selection (#6); reduces large holes to match left bgs only (3 contributions). Unknown: exact pixel calc (consistent 58 but unexplained; not scalable to test heights 24/28).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 20:25:11] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a consistent frame color (borders) around sections of content, where sections are separated by full horizontal border rows, and each section contains multiple vertical panels delimited by frame-colored vertical lines. The goal is to process the input grid by identifying sections, selecting a specific panel from each based on a patterned index rule (e.g., middle for first section, left for second), extracting each as a standardized 7-column wide panel (preserving borders and padding content to fit), and stacking them vertically into an output grid of the same height but fixed 7-width, with border rows preserved as full frame lines.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always taken from the top-left cell (g[0][0]) and assumed consistent across all borders; empty grids default to 0.
 * Horizontal border rows are entire rows of only the frame color and must be output as full 7-wide frame rows; they also signal section boundaries, incrementing the section index after processing a section.
 * Within a non-border row, vertical borders are positions with frame color; panels are the regions between consecutive vertical borders (num_panels = len(border_pos) - 1).
 * If no vertical borders (num_panels == 0), treat the whole row as a single panel spanning 0 to min(7, W).
 * Panel selection follows a specific pattern by section_idx: for section 0, pick the 3rd panel (index 2, assuming at least 3); for section 1, pick the 1st (index 0); for section 2, pick index 1 if exactly 3 panels else the last; for later sections, alternate starting with index 0 for odd section_idx and last for even.
 * Panel extraction: For each content row in a section, take left border value + up to 5 content cells immediately after left up to but not including right border + right border value; truncate to 7 columns, pad right with frame color if under 7 (never left-pad or expand beyond 5 content).
 * Sections start on the first non-border row after a border, and the same left/right positions are used for all rows in the section until the next border row.
 * Output maintains original height H, but all rows are forced to exactly 7 columns; border rows are always [frame_c] * 7.
 * Subtlety: If a section has fewer panels than the selection index, clamp to num_panels - 1 (e.g., choose_panel_index mins to valid range).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; single-panel sections use full width; content shorter than 5 cells gets padded; vertical borders might not align perfectly across rows, but positions are detected per row—however, the code assumes consistent positions per section by setting once at section start.
 * Potential miss: The pattern for choose_panel_index is heuristic-based on "observed pattern" from training, which may not generalize if test has different panel counts or section behaviors; alternating for later sections assumes a zigzag selection.
 * Another subtlety: Content extraction slices row[content_start:content_end][:5], which caps at 5 even if more available, ensuring fixed inner width.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid, which is consistent across all borders."""
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color, indicating a horizontal border row that must be preserved as a 7-wide frame row in output."""

    """Finds all column indices in the row where the frame color appears, indicating vertical border positions for panel delimiting within a section."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects the panel index to extract based on the section index and number of panels, following the observed pattern: index 2 for section 0, 0 for 1, 1 or last for 2 depending on count, alternating 0/last for later sections."""

        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int, frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Extracts a 7-column panel row from the input row: left border value + up to the first 5 content cells between left and right + right border value, padding with frame color if shorter than 7."""
    W = len(row)
    lval = row[left] if left < W else frame_c
    rval = row[right] if right < W else frame_c
    content_start = left + 1
    content_end = right
    content = row[content_start:content_end][:5]
    out_row = [lval] + content + [rval]
    out_row = out_row[:7]
    while len(out_row) < 7:
        out_row.append(frame_c)
    return out_row
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of frame detection, sectioning, panel selection, and 7-wide extraction.
 * The choose_panel_index heuristic worked for training but may be overfitted; for sections beyond 2, the alternating 0/last logic assumes a pattern that might not hold if test sections have varying panel counts or different selection rules (e.g., always middle, or cyclic).
 * Border position detection via get_border_positions is helpful and correctly identifies vertical delimiters per row, but setting left/right only at section start (on first content row) assumes consistent borders across the section—could fail if borders shift row-to-row.
 * extract_panel_row correctly caps content at 5 and pads, preserving borders, which aligned with training expectations.
 * is_border_row and get_frame_color are solid and essential for identifying structure without errors in training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index may need refinement for generalization.
 * Training 1 and 2 passed fully, including proper panel selection and output formatting, but no specific mismatches detailed (assumed exact match to expected).
 * Potential issue: If training had fewer sections, the alternating logic for section_idx > 2 wasn't tested, leading to possible overconfidence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row by 7-column grid with frame color 4, inner color 8 for borders/sub-borders, and 1s for content; it consists of 4 identical 7-row panels (each a bordered shape with 1s forming a partial figure or letter-like pattern) separated by single full-4 border rows, repeating the exact same panel 4 times.
 * This does not look correct, as it suggests the program is selecting and extracting the same panel (likely index 2 or similar, with consistent left/right positions like columns for 8-1-8 patterns) for every section, resulting in repetitive output instead of varied panels from different sections.
 * Expected output should likely vary per section (e.g., different panel indices yielding unique 1-patterns or shapes per 7-row block), stacking distinct extracted panels while preserving borders; the repetition indicates a failure in choose_panel_index to alternate or select differently for sections 0-3, or possibly misdetecting num_panels per section (e.g., always seeing 3+ panels and picking the same one).
 * The patterns within each block (e.g., row 1: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4]; row 2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]; etc.) show proper 7-wide formatting and padding, but the lack of variation across blocks means it's not capturing the puzzle's intent of composing a composite image from specific panels—probably the test input has 4 sections with multiple panels each (e.g., 3-4 panels), and correct selection should yield a progressive or combined figure (unknown exact expected, but repetition is a clear red flag).
 * Subtle difference: If test sections have varying num_panels (e.g., some with 2 panels, triggering last index), the clamp in choose_panel_index might still pick similarly; output height matches (28 rows implies original H=28 with borders), but content sameness differs from expected diversity.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 20:25:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row is filled with the frame color, indicating a border."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds all column indices in a row where the frame color appears (potential panel starts)."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_panel_starts(border_pos: List[int], W: int) -> List[int]:
    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

    content_end = right
    content = row[content_start:content_end][:5]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured like framed sections (e.g., comic panels or divided regions) separated by solid border rows of a uniform frame color, where each section contains multiple sub-panels divided by vertical frame lines, and the goal is to extract and output a specific sub-panel from each section based on rules tied to the section's position, resizing it to a standard 7-column width while preserving the frame borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts and ends with (and is separated by) full border rows consisting entirely of the frame color (e.g., all 4s), which act as dividers between sections; these must be copied verbatim to the output as 7-wide rows of frame color.
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell (or 0 if empty), assuming it's consistent across the grid; borders in sections are vertical lines of this color separating sub-panels.
 * Each non-border section has a variable number of sub-panels (num_panels = number of border positions - 1), identified by positions where the row hits the frame color; extraction targets a specific sub-panel index per section (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second, etc.), falling back to valid ranges if needed.
 * Sub-panel extraction slices content between left and right border positions, taking exactly the left border value, the first 5 content cells (to standardize width), and the right border value, resulting in 7-column rows; this is applied row-by-row for the entire section height until the next border row.
 * Sections without panels (no borders found) are skipped entirely, advancing past them without output.
 * Section index increments only after processing a valid section with panels, ensuring selection logic applies sequentially to content-bearing sections.
 * Subtle: Vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows (but code assumes they do for extraction); content may include colors like 8 (possibly inner frames or fillers) or 1 (patterns), which are preserved as-is without interpretation.
 * Easy to miss: Overly wide sections may have content beyond the 5-slice, leading to truncation; fallback logic (e.g., panel_idx = num_panels - 1 if out of range) prevents crashes but may select wrong panels; repetitive sections in input could lead to near-identical outputs if selection always picks similar sub-panels.
 * All attempts must handle empty grids (return empty list) and ensure output rows are exactly 7 elements; no rotation, flipping, or merging of extracted panels—output stacks them sequentially with borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Identifies the uniform frame color from top-left; essential for detecting borders and assuming consistency.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is a full horizontal border; key for section delimiting and copying borders to output.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1:right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```
(Cores extraction logic: grabs left/right borders and exactly 5 inner cells to standardize to 7 columns; handles variable widths by truncation, preserving frame values.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects which sub-panel to extract based on section order and panel count; includes fallbacks for varying num_panels, e.g., picks middle-ish or edge panels; crucial for puzzle's selection rule.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, correctly identifying frame color, detecting border rows, extracting the right sub-panel per section, and standardizing to 7 columns without errors.
 * The section-skipping logic for empty sections worked, as did incrementing section_idx only after valid extractions.
 * choose_panel_index handled specific cases (e.g., index 2 for first section, assuming at least 3 panels) with fallbacks, which aligned with training data.
 * extract_panel_row's 5-content slice correctly truncated wider panels, preserving borders as frame color.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes vertical borders align across section rows (uses first row's positions for all), which could fail if misaligned—though it worked for training.
 * get_frame_color and is_border_row are robust and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but prior attempts (implied) might have lacked fallback in choose_panel_index, causing index errors on low-panel sections.
 * Overall, core loop (while r < H, check border vs. section start) effectively parsed structure without overcomplicating.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 8 stacked sections (each ~7 rows high), starting/ending with full [4]*7 border rows, and inner sections showing 7-column panels with left/right 4 borders, inner 8s (likely filler or sub-frame), and patterns of 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], [4,8,1,8,8,1,4], etc.); sections are nearly identical, repeating the same 5-row pattern of 1/8 arrangements flanked by 8-filled rows.
 * This looks partially correct in structure (borders copied, extractions standardized to 7 columns, sections delimited), but suspicious due to high repetition—suggests the test input has multiple similar multi-panel sections (e.g., 4+ panels each), and the program consistently selected a sub-panel with 8-heavy content and simple 1 patterns, possibly the second or third panel if sections have 3+ panels.
 * It does not look fully correct because the patterns (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s or blobs) across the 5 content columns seem truncated or simplistic; expected output might combine or select varying sub-panels (e.g., alternating left/middle/right) to form a progressive puzzle image, but here all sections output near-identical panels, missing variety—possibly wrong panel selection for later sections (e.g., choose_panel_index's else clause picking edges too predictably).
 * The 8s as inner elements are preserved correctly (not treated as frames), but if the puzzle intends 8s as secondary borders, extraction might need nested slicing (not handled); output height matches multi-section input, but without the actual test grid, the repetition implies over-extraction or input similarity, differing from expected by lacking diversity in selected content.
 * Note: The output is different from a "correct" expectation of a single cohesive image or varied panel sequence; it's a stack of similar extracts, which may not solve the visual puzzle (e.g., if goal is to reveal a hidden picture by picking specific panels).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) structured as framed sections, likely resembling comic panels or divided images, where the task is to extract and output a specific 7-cell-wide panel from each section based on section index and number of panels, preserving frames and inner content while handling borders and varying panel counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows that are entirely one color (frame color, often 4), separating vertical sections; these must be copied as full 7-cell frame rows in output.
 * Within sections, panels are vertically aligned and separated by vertical frame-color columns (also 4); the number of panels is one less than the number of frame positions in a row.
 * Panel extraction takes the left and right frame cells, plus up to 5 inner content cells (sliced from left+1 to right, taking first 5), always outputting exactly 7 cells per row (pad with frame color if short, truncate if long, though grids seem designed to fit).
 * Panel selection depends on section index (0-based, incrementing per section) and number of panels: e.g., section 0 picks the 3rd panel (index 2), section 1 picks first (0), section 2 picks middle (1) or last if not 3 panels, later sections alternate first/last based on parity.
 * Frame color is determined from top-left cell; assume consistent across grid.
 * Sections must be detected by transitioning from border to non-border rows; invalid sections (no panels) are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Ensure bounds checking to avoid index errors; content rows may have varying widths but extraction assumes W is consistent; repeated identical sections in test suggest symmetric or patterned input, but selection logic must handle varying num_panels (e.g., 2 vs 3 panels changes section 2 choice).
 * Easy to miss: Padding only with frame color if under 7; not all sections have the same num_panels, so min() clamp in panel_idx prevents overflow; vertical alignment assumes all rows in section have same border positions.
 * Overall output maintains section structure with extracted panels "zoomed" to 7-wide, including top/bottom borders as full frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This reliably detects the frame color from top-left, assuming consistent framing.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Essential for identifying and copying full border rows; simple and accurate.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    return [row[left]] + content + [row[right]]
```
(Core extraction logic; correctly grabs frames + limited inner content to fit 7-wide; add padding/truncation in main function as needed.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Panel selection rule; handles special cases for early sections and alternates for later ones; clamping with min(panel_idx, num_panels-1) prevents errors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic section detection, border copying, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely simpler grids with 2-3 panels and fewer sections).
 * Worked well for frame color detection and border row identification, as training passed without errors.
 * Panel extraction via extract_panel_row produced correct 7-wide outputs with frames intact for training.
 * choose_panel_index correctly selected panels for early sections (0,1,2) in training, suggesting the rules match those examples.
 * Did not fail on bounds or empty grids in training, showing robust in_section tracking and skipping.
 * However, for more complex cases like the test (multiple identical sections), it may over-rely on assuming consistent num_panels; if test has varying panels per section, selection could pick wrong (e.g., index 2 invalid if only 2 panels).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, etc.) are relevant and worked for training—none are broken, but main loop could improve section ending detection if borders are missed.
 * Overall, core structure (while loop scanning rows, starting sections on non-borders) is solid but untested on repetition or asymmetry.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 4 repeated sections (each: top border [4]*7, 6 content rows like [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] down to patterns with 1s, bottom border [4]*7), followed by an extra border, totaling ~29 rows with identical content across sections.
 * This suggests the program detected 4 sections, extracted the same panel (likely index 0 or leftmost, given consistent starting 4,8,... patterns) from each, assuming num_panels >=2 and sections have identical inner content (8 as background, 1 as details like shapes or letters).
 * The output makes sense structurally (preserves frames, 7-wide, section separation) and matches extraction rules: e.g., first content [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] implies 5 inner 8s from a wider panel; later rows show sliced content like [8,1,1,8,1] which could be partial shapes.
 * However, repetition of identical sections implies the input grid has symmetric or tiled content, but if choose_panel_index intended variety (e.g., section 0 picks index 2/middle, section 1 picks 0/left), the identical output suggests either all sections have 3+ panels with middle identical to left, or logic fell back to left (e.g., due to num_panels=2 clamping index 2 to 1, but still same if symmetric).
 * It does not look fully correct if the puzzle expects different panels per section (e.g., varying images); the uniformity might miss subtle differences in input panels, or fail to alternate properly for later sections (idx 3 should pick last if even). Unknown why identical—possibly input is repetitive, but expected output should show progression/variation if selecting different panels.
 * Positive: No crashes or invalid rows; patterns like [8,1,1,8,1] resemble sliced comic elements (e.g., letters 'B' or shapes in 1s), so extraction works, but verify if it matches expected by mentally simulating: if test input has 3 panels per section with distinct content, output should differ across sections, not repeat identically.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where a large grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows (all one color), and each section contains multiple vertical panels defined by frame-colored borders; the goal is to extract a specific 7-column-wide panel from each section based on the section's index, including borders and up to 5 content cells, then output these panels in sequence with horizontal borders preserved, padding short rows to exactly 7 columns with the frame color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 4 in the test output); all borders (horizontal full rows and vertical panel dividers) use this color, but content uses other values (e.g., 8 as filler/background, 1 as distinct elements).
 * Horizontal borders are full rows of frame color only; content sections are contiguous rows between them without full frame rows.
 * In content rows, vertical borders are positions where frame color appears; panels are defined between consecutive border positions (left border + content + right border).
 * Panel selection is deterministic per section index: e.g., 3rd panel (index 2) for section 0, 1st (index 0) for section 1, middle or last for section 2 depending on count, and alternating first/last for later sections—ensuring index doesn't exceed available panels.
 * Extraction per row: Slice from chosen left border to right border, include left/right values, take up to 5 content cells between them; if the slice yields fewer than 7 total columns, pad right with frame color (subtle: never truncate if more than 5 content, but cap content at 5 to fit 7-wide).
 * Sections must have at least 2 border positions to be valid; skip invalid ones.
 * Output preserves structure: full 7-wide frame rows for horizontal borders, and 7-wide panel rows for content sections.
 * Easy to miss: Padding only happens if <7 after extraction (e.g., narrow panels); assume consistent grid width, but panels may vary; section indexing starts at 0 and increments after each content block.
 * Content may include non-frame colors like 8 (possibly background) and 1 (patterns/objects); extraction should preserve these exactly without alteration.
 * Global considerations: Empty grid returns empty; handle variable panel counts per section; no vertical borders in output beyond the chosen panel's left/right.

    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; the program correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, accurately detecting frame color, borders, sections, and panel selection to produce valid outputs.
 * Worked: Proper sectioning with horizontal border detection and skipping invalid sections; consistent 7-wide extraction with padding; panel index choice handled variable num_panels and clamped to valid range.
 * Did not work (or potentially): In the test, the program produced identical panel patterns across all four sections (each a 6-row block of 4/8/1 patterns), which suggests it may be selecting panels with identical content or failing to vary selection correctly if the input panels differ—unknown without input grid, but repetition implies possible bug in section_idx increment or border detection if sections aren't truly identical.
 * choose_panel_index is essential and seems correct for varying selections (e.g., index 2 for section 0, 0 for 1, etc.), but if test has >3 panels or non-3, the logic for section 2+ might not align if panels differ.
 * extract_panel_row is helpful for precise slicing but caps content at 5, which worked for training; however, if test panels have >5 content cells, it truncates them (subtle omission: may lose data if panels are wide).
 * get_border_positions assumes all frame occurrences are borders, which worked for training but could misfire if frame color appears in content (not seen in outputs).
 * Overall, core logic demonstrates understanding of bordering and extraction, but test repetition hints at over-simplification or input-specific issue (e.g., all sections having symmetric panels).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks: each starts with a 7-wide horizontal border of [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], followed by 6 content rows of a consistent 7-wide panel pattern (borders 4, background 8s, and 1s in positions forming a shape like a figure-8 or connected blobs: e.g., row2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]), ending with another border; the entire output is 29 rows, symmetric and repetitive.
 * This does not look fully correct because the identical patterns across sections suggest the program is extracting the same panel type (e.g., always a middle or similar panel with the 8/1 shape) from potentially different input sections—if the test input has varying panels per section (as implied by puzzle needing specific index selection), the output should show different 1-patterns or contents per block, not repetition; the sameness indicates possible failure to detect unique vertical borders or apply varying panel_idx correctly.
 * The patterns themselves make sense internally (preserved colors, exact 7-width, padding not needed as slices fit), but the lack of variation across sections is suspicious and differs from expected diversity in a multi-section puzzle; unknown if input is symmetric, but it feels like over-extraction of one panel archetype.
 * No empty or skipped sections apparent, and borders are correctly output as full 4s, but if test has 3+ panels per section, the choice logic (e.g., index 2 for first section) might be pulling the same shaped panel each time coincidentally.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a consistent frame color (borders) around sections of content, where sections are separated by full horizontal border rows, and each section contains multiple vertical panels delimited by frame-colored vertical lines. The goal is to process the input grid by identifying sections, selecting a specific panel from each based on a patterned index rule (e.g., middle for first section, left for second), extracting each as a standardized 7-column wide panel (preserving borders and padding content to fit), and stacking them vertically into an output grid of the same height but fixed 7-width, with border rows preserved as full frame lines.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always taken from the top-left cell (g[0][0]) and assumed consistent across all borders; empty grids default to 0.
 * Horizontal border rows are entire rows of only the frame color and must be output as full 7-wide frame rows; they also signal section boundaries, incrementing the section index after processing a section.
 * Within a non-border row, vertical borders are positions with frame color; panels are the regions between consecutive vertical borders (num_panels = len(border_pos) - 1).
 * If no vertical borders (num_panels == 0), treat the whole row as a single panel spanning 0 to min(7, W).
 * Panel selection follows a specific pattern by section_idx: for section 0, pick the 3rd panel (index 2, assuming at least 3); for section 1, pick the 1st (index 0); for section 2, pick index 1 if exactly 3 panels else the last; for later sections, alternate starting with index 0 for odd section_idx and last for even.
 * Panel extraction: For each content row in a section, take left border value + up to 5 content cells immediately after left up to but not including right border + right border value; truncate to 7 columns, pad right with frame color if under 7 (never left-pad or expand beyond 5 content).
 * Sections start on the first non-border row after a border, and the same left/right positions are used for all rows in the section until the next border row.
 * Output maintains original height H, but all rows are forced to exactly 7 columns; border rows are always [frame_c] * 7.
 * Subtlety: If a section has fewer panels than the selection index, clamp to num_panels - 1 (e.g., choose_panel_index mins to valid range).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; single-panel sections use full width; content shorter than 5 cells gets padded; vertical borders might not align perfectly across rows, but positions are detected per row—however, the code assumes consistent positions per section by setting once at section start.
 * Potential miss: The pattern for choose_panel_index is heuristic-based on "observed pattern" from training, which may not generalize if test has different panel counts or section behaviors; alternating for later sections assumes a zigzag selection.
 * Another subtlety: Content extraction slices row[content_start:content_end][:5], which caps at 5 even if more available, ensuring fixed inner width.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of frame detection, sectioning, panel selection, and 7-wide extraction.
 * The choose_panel_index heuristic worked for training but may be overfitted; for sections beyond 2, the alternating 0/last logic assumes a pattern that might not hold if test sections have varying panel counts or different selection rules (e.g., always middle, or cyclic).
 * Border position detection via get_border_positions is helpful and correctly identifies vertical delimiters per row, but setting left/right only at section start (on first content row) assumes consistent borders across the section—could fail if borders shift row-to-row.
 * extract_panel_row correctly caps content at 5 and pads, preserving borders, which aligned with training expectations.
 * is_border_row and get_frame_color are solid and essential for identifying structure without errors in training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index may need refinement for generalization.
 * Training 1 and 2 passed fully, including proper panel selection and output formatting, but no specific mismatches detailed (assumed exact match to expected).
 * Potential issue: If training had fewer sections, the alternating logic for section_idx > 2 wasn't tested, leading to possible overconfidence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row by 7-column grid with frame color 4, inner color 8 for borders/sub-borders, and 1s for content; it consists of 4 identical 7-row panels (each a bordered shape with 1s forming a partial figure or letter-like pattern) separated by single full-4 border rows, repeating the exact same panel 4 times.
 * This does not look correct, as it suggests the program is selecting and extracting the same panel (likely index 2 or similar, with consistent left/right positions like columns for 8-1-8 patterns) for every section, resulting in repetitive output instead of varied panels from different sections.
 * Expected output should likely vary per section (e.g., different panel indices yielding unique 1-patterns or shapes per 7-row block), stacking distinct extracted panels while preserving borders; the repetition indicates a failure in choose_panel_index to alternate or select differently for sections 0-3, or possibly misdetecting num_panels per section (e.g., always seeing 3+ panels and picking the same one).
 * The patterns within each block (e.g., row 1: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4]; row 2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]; etc.) show proper 7-wide formatting and padding, but the lack of variation across blocks means it's not capturing the puzzle's intent of composing a composite image from specific panels—probably the test input has 4 sections with multiple panels each (e.g., 3-4 panels), and correct selection should yield a progressive or combined figure (unknown exact expected, but repetition is a clear red flag).
 * Subtle difference: If test sections have varying num_panels (e.g., some with 2 panels, triggering last index), the clamp in choose_panel_index might still pick similarly; output height matches (28 rows implies original H=28 with borders), but content sameness differs from expected diversity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

        return [], []

    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:26:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid framed with a consistent border color (e.g., 4), divided into vertical sections or panels separated by border columns, where the goal is to detect these sections, select a specific panel from each based on its index or position, extract and pad the content to a fixed 7-column width (framed with the border color), and output a new grid that skips or simplifies border rows while preserving the chosen panel's internal structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows (entirely filled with frame color) that should be output as full 7-column frame rows, but content sections between them need panel extraction.
 * Panels within a section are delimited by vertical border positions (columns matching frame color in non-border rows); the number of panels is typically the count of border positions minus one.
 * Panel selection is rule-based on section index (e.g., first section picks the third panel, second picks the first, third picks the second or last if three panels exist), which handles varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) but may fail if sections have unexpected panel counts.
 * Extraction must slice content between left and right borders, include the borders in the output row, limit inner content to 5 cells (to fit 7 total: left + 5 + right), and pad with frame color if shorter; this assumes fixed-width output per row.
 * Sections end when a border row is encountered, and processing advances row-by-row, incrementing section index only after full sections.
 * Subtle edge cases: empty grid returns empty; single-row sections or no borders fallback to slicing first 7 columns; assumes grid width >=7, but padding handles shorter rows; vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows in a section, but extraction uses per-row border positions (though current code uses fixed left/right from first row, which could miss misalignments).
 * Frame color is always from top-left cell; non-border rows may have partial frame elements (e.g., 8 as a sub-frame color inside panels).
 * Puzzle likely involves symbolic panels (e.g., numbers like 1 and 8 representing shapes or objects), so extraction must preserve internal patterns without alteration.
 * Across attempts, considerations include handling multiple identical sections (test has repeats), ensuring panel choice cycles correctly (e.g., not always picking the same panel), and avoiding over-extraction (e.g., content[:5] limits width).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Extracts the border color from top-left; reliable and simple.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Detects full horizontal borders; essential for section delimiting.)

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```
(Finds vertical border columns in a row; key for panel detection, but note: should ideally be consistent across section rows.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects panel based on section and panel count; works for 2-3 panels but may need generalization for more or varying counts; min() clamp added in code prevents index errors.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int, frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    W = len(row)
    lval = row[left] if left < W else frame_c
    rval = row[right] if right < W else frame_c
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    out_row = [lval] + content + [rval]
    while len(out_row) < 7:
        out_row.append(frame_c)
    return out_row[:7]
```
(Extracts and pads a single row's panel content; helpful but assumes fixed left/right from section start—could be improved to detect per-row borders for jagged sections.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully detecting frames, sections, panel counts, and extracting/padding chosen panels to 7 columns while simplifying borders.
 * Worked well for basic sectioning: border rows output as full frames, content sections process row-by-row until next border, section index increments properly.
 * choose_panel_index logic passed trains, suggesting it matches the rule for selecting specific panels (e.g., third for first section, first for second) in those cases.
 * Fallback for no panels (slice first 7 and pad) wasn't triggered in trains but provides robustness.
 * However, did not work for the test input: output is four identical 7-row patterns (each a framed panel with internal 1s and 8s), repeating the same structure, indicating likely incorrect panel selection across multiple sections—probably always picking the same panel (e.g., index 2 or middle) due to section_idx logic failing on more sections or consistent 3-panel layouts.
 * extract_panel_row is mostly helpful but may over-pad or truncate if content >5 inner cells, though it didn't break trains; subtle issue: uses fixed left/right from first row of section, ignoring potential shifts in later rows (could cause misalignment in test).
 * get_border_positions is useful but computed only on first row of section—recomputing per row might help jagged borders, but wasn't needed for trains.
 * No object extraction functions were used (e.g., no blob detection for 1s/8s as shapes); this attempt treated panels as raw slices, which worked for trains but may miss if puzzle requires interpreting internals (e.g., counting connected 1s).
 * Earlier implicit attempts (inferred from code evolution) likely missed panel cycling, as this version added choose_panel_index to fix selection.
 * is_border_row is solid and not broken.
 * Overall, core sectioning and padding worked, but panel choice and multi-section handling failed test for unknown reasons (possibly test has >3 sections or varying panel counts not covered by choose_panel_index).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks, each 8 rows high (7 content +1 bottom border? but actually 7 per block plus shared borders), with each block showing a consistent pattern: top/bottom full 4s, then rows with 4-8-frames around a panel containing 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], etc.), repeating exactly.
 * This does not look correct because the test input (inferred from output) likely has multiple distinct sections with different panels, but the output extracts the same panel pattern four times, suggesting the program is selecting the same panel index (e.g., always 2 for 3-panel sections) across all sections instead of varying by section_idx.
 * Repetition implies failure to differentiate sections: if test has four sections with 3 panels each, it should output four different panels (e.g., panel2, panel0, panel1, then cycle), but instead it's identical, so probably section_idx isn't advancing correctly or num_panels detection is stuck.
 * The internal panel looks like a specific shape (8s as borders, 1s as content, possibly a symbol like a face or letter), preserved correctly per extraction, but wrong choice makes whole output invalid.
 * Padding to 7 columns works (no overflows), and frame color 4 is consistent, but lack of variation confirms it's not matching expected diverse output.
 * No empty or fallback rows appear, so border detection succeeded, but overall output is uniform where diversity is expected—definitely incorrect.

[2025-10-01 20:26:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid framed with a consistent border color (e.g., 4), divided into vertical sections or panels separated by border columns, where the goal is to detect these sections, select a specific panel from each based on its index or position, extract and pad the content to a fixed 7-column width (framed with the border color), and output a new grid that skips or simplifies border rows while preserving the chosen panel's internal structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows (entirely filled with frame color) that should be output as full 7-column frame rows, but content sections between them need panel extraction.
 * Panels within a section are delimited by vertical border positions (columns matching frame color in non-border rows); the number of panels is typically the count of border positions minus one.
 * Panel selection is rule-based on section index (e.g., first section picks the third panel, second picks the first, third picks the second or last if three panels exist), which handles varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) but may fail if sections have unexpected panel counts.
 * Extraction must slice content between left and right borders, include the borders in the output row, limit inner content to 5 cells (to fit 7 total: left + 5 + right), and pad with frame color if shorter; this assumes fixed-width output per row.
 * Sections end when a border row is encountered, and processing advances row-by-row, incrementing section index only after full sections.
 * Subtle edge cases: empty grid returns empty; single-row sections or no borders fallback to slicing first 7 columns; assumes grid width >=7, but padding handles shorter rows; vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows in a section, but extraction uses per-row border positions (though current code uses fixed left/right from first row, which could miss misalignments).
 * Frame color is always from top-left cell; non-border rows may have partial frame elements (e.g., 8 as a sub-frame color inside panels).
 * Puzzle likely involves symbolic panels (e.g., numbers like 1 and 8 representing shapes or objects), so extraction must preserve internal patterns without alteration.
 * Across attempts, considerations include handling multiple identical sections (test has repeats), ensuring panel choice cycles correctly (e.g., not always picking the same panel), and avoiding over-extraction (e.g., content[:5] limits width).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Extracts the border color from top-left; reliable and simple.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Detects full horizontal borders; essential for section delimiting.)

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```
(Finds vertical border columns in a row; key for panel detection, but note: should ideally be consistent across section rows.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects panel based on section and panel count; works for 2-3 panels but may need generalization for more or varying counts; min() clamp added in code prevents index errors.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int, frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    W = len(row)
    lval = row[left] if left < W else frame_c
    rval = row[right] if right < W else frame_c
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    out_row = [lval] + content + [rval]
    while len(out_row) < 7:
        out_row.append(frame_c)
    return out_row[:7]
```
(Extracts and pads a single row's panel content; helpful but assumes fixed left/right from section start—could be improved to detect per-row borders for jagged sections.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully detecting frames, sections, panel counts, and extracting/padding chosen panels to 7 columns while simplifying borders.
 * Worked well for basic sectioning: border rows output as full frames, content sections process row-by-row until next border, section index increments properly.
 * choose_panel_index logic passed trains, suggesting it matches the rule for selecting specific panels (e.g., third for first section, first for second) in those cases.
 * Fallback for no panels (slice first 7 and pad) wasn't triggered in trains but provides robustness.
 * However, did not work for the test input: output is four identical 7-row patterns (each a framed panel with internal 1s and 8s), repeating the same structure, indicating likely incorrect panel selection across multiple sections—probably always picking the same panel (e.g., index 2 or middle) due to section_idx logic failing on more sections or consistent 3-panel layouts.
 * extract_panel_row is mostly helpful but may over-pad or truncate if content >5 inner cells, though it didn't break trains; subtle issue: uses fixed left/right from first row of section, ignoring potential shifts in later rows (could cause misalignment in test).
 * get_border_positions is useful but computed only on first row of section—recomputing per row might help jagged borders, but wasn't needed for trains.
 * No object extraction functions were used (e.g., no blob detection for 1s/8s as shapes); this attempt treated panels as raw slices, which worked for trains but may miss if puzzle requires interpreting internals (e.g., counting connected 1s).
 * Earlier implicit attempts (inferred from code evolution) likely missed panel cycling, as this version added choose_panel_index to fix selection.
 * is_border_row is solid and not broken.
 * Overall, core sectioning and padding worked, but panel choice and multi-section handling failed test for unknown reasons (possibly test has >3 sections or varying panel counts not covered by choose_panel_index).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks, each 8 rows high (7 content +1 bottom border? but actually 7 per block plus shared borders), with each block showing a consistent pattern: top/bottom full 4s, then rows with 4-8-frames around a panel containing 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], etc.), repeating exactly.
 * This does not look correct because the test input (inferred from output) likely has multiple distinct sections with different panels, but the output extracts the same panel pattern four times, suggesting the program is selecting the same panel index (e.g., always 2 for 3-panel sections) across all sections instead of varying by section_idx.
 * Repetition implies failure to differentiate sections: if test has four sections with 3 panels each, it should output four different panels (e.g., panel2, panel0, panel1, then cycle), but instead it's identical, so probably section_idx isn't advancing correctly or num_panels detection is stuck.
 * The internal panel looks like a specific shape (8s as borders, 1s as content, possibly a symbol like a face or letter), preserved correctly per extraction, but wrong choice makes whole output invalid.
 * Padding to 7 columns works (no overflows), and frame color 4 is consistent, but lack of variation confirms it's not matching expected diverse output.
 * No empty or fallback rows appear, so border detection succeeded, but overall output is uniform where diversity is expected—definitely incorrect.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row is filled with the frame color, indicating a border."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds all column indices in a row where the frame color appears (potential panel starts)."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_panel_starts(border_pos: List[int], W: int) -> List[int]:
    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured like framed sections (e.g., comic panels or divided regions) separated by solid border rows of a uniform frame color, where each section contains multiple sub-panels divided by vertical frame lines, and the goal is to extract and output a specific sub-panel from each section based on rules tied to the section's position, resizing it to a standard 7-column width while preserving the frame borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts and ends with (and is separated by) full border rows consisting entirely of the frame color (e.g., all 4s), which act as dividers between sections; these must be copied verbatim to the output as 7-wide rows of frame color.
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell (or 0 if empty), assuming it's consistent across the grid; borders in sections are vertical lines of this color separating sub-panels.
 * Each non-border section has a variable number of sub-panels (num_panels = number of border positions - 1), identified by positions where the row hits the frame color; extraction targets a specific sub-panel index per section (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second, etc.), falling back to valid ranges if needed.
 * Sub-panel extraction slices content between left and right border positions, taking exactly the left border value, the first 5 content cells (to standardize width), and the right border value, resulting in 7-column rows; this is applied row-by-row for the entire section height until the next border row.
 * Sections without panels (no borders found) are skipped entirely, advancing past them without output.
 * Section index increments only after processing a valid section with panels, ensuring selection logic applies sequentially to content-bearing sections.
 * Subtle: Vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows (but code assumes they do for extraction); content may include colors like 8 (possibly inner frames or fillers) or 1 (patterns), which are preserved as-is without interpretation.
 * Easy to miss: Overly wide sections may have content beyond the 5-slice, leading to truncation; fallback logic (e.g., panel_idx = num_panels - 1 if out of range) prevents crashes but may select wrong panels; repetitive sections in input could lead to near-identical outputs if selection always picks similar sub-panels.
 * All attempts must handle empty grids (return empty list) and ensure output rows are exactly 7 elements; no rotation, flipping, or merging of extracted panels—output stacks them sequentially with borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Identifies the uniform frame color from top-left; essential for detecting borders and assuming consistency.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is a full horizontal border; key for section delimiting and copying borders to output.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1:right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```
(Cores extraction logic: grabs left/right borders and exactly 5 inner cells to standardize to 7 columns; handles variable widths by truncation, preserving frame values.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects which sub-panel to extract based on section order and panel count; includes fallbacks for varying num_panels, e.g., picks middle-ish or edge panels; crucial for puzzle's selection rule.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, correctly identifying frame color, detecting border rows, extracting the right sub-panel per section, and standardizing to 7 columns without errors.
 * The section-skipping logic for empty sections worked, as did incrementing section_idx only after valid extractions.
 * choose_panel_index handled specific cases (e.g., index 2 for first section, assuming at least 3 panels) with fallbacks, which aligned with training data.
 * extract_panel_row's 5-content slice correctly truncated wider panels, preserving borders as frame color.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes vertical borders align across section rows (uses first row's positions for all), which could fail if misaligned—though it worked for training.
 * get_frame_color and is_border_row are robust and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but prior attempts (implied) might have lacked fallback in choose_panel_index, causing index errors on low-panel sections.
 * Overall, core loop (while r < H, check border vs. section start) effectively parsed structure without overcomplicating.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 8 stacked sections (each ~7 rows high), starting/ending with full [4]*7 border rows, and inner sections showing 7-column panels with left/right 4 borders, inner 8s (likely filler or sub-frame), and patterns of 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], [4,8,1,8,8,1,4], etc.); sections are nearly identical, repeating the same 5-row pattern of 1/8 arrangements flanked by 8-filled rows.
 * This looks partially correct in structure (borders copied, extractions standardized to 7 columns, sections delimited), but suspicious due to high repetition—suggests the test input has multiple similar multi-panel sections (e.g., 4+ panels each), and the program consistently selected a sub-panel with 8-heavy content and simple 1 patterns, possibly the second or third panel if sections have 3+ panels.
 * It does not look fully correct because the patterns (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s or blobs) across the 5 content columns seem truncated or simplistic; expected output might combine or select varying sub-panels (e.g., alternating left/middle/right) to form a progressive puzzle image, but here all sections output near-identical panels, missing variety—possibly wrong panel selection for later sections (e.g., choose_panel_index's else clause picking edges too predictably).
 * The 8s as inner elements are preserved correctly (not treated as frames), but if the puzzle intends 8s as secondary borders, extraction might need nested slicing (not handled); output height matches multi-section input, but without the actual test grid, the repetition implies over-extraction or input similarity, differing from expected by lacking diversity in selected content.
 * Note: The output is different from a "correct" expectation of a single cohesive image or varied panel sequence; it's a stack of similar extracts, which may not solve the visual puzzle (e.g., if goal is to reveal a hidden picture by picking specific panels).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) structured as framed sections, likely resembling comic panels or divided images, where the task is to extract and output a specific 7-cell-wide panel from each section based on section index and number of panels, preserving frames and inner content while handling borders and varying panel counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows that are entirely one color (frame color, often 4), separating vertical sections; these must be copied as full 7-cell frame rows in output.
 * Within sections, panels are vertically aligned and separated by vertical frame-color columns (also 4); the number of panels is one less than the number of frame positions in a row.
 * Panel extraction takes the left and right frame cells, plus up to 5 inner content cells (sliced from left+1 to right, taking first 5), always outputting exactly 7 cells per row (pad with frame color if short, truncate if long, though grids seem designed to fit).
 * Panel selection depends on section index (0-based, incrementing per section) and number of panels: e.g., section 0 picks the 3rd panel (index 2), section 1 picks first (0), section 2 picks middle (1) or last if not 3 panels, later sections alternate first/last based on parity.
 * Frame color is determined from top-left cell; assume consistent across grid.
 * Sections must be detected by transitioning from border to non-border rows; invalid sections (no panels) are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Ensure bounds checking to avoid index errors; content rows may have varying widths but extraction assumes W is consistent; repeated identical sections in test suggest symmetric or patterned input, but selection logic must handle varying num_panels (e.g., 2 vs 3 panels changes section 2 choice).
 * Easy to miss: Padding only with frame color if under 7; not all sections have the same num_panels, so min() clamp in panel_idx prevents overflow; vertical alignment assumes all rows in section have same border positions.
 * Overall output maintains section structure with extracted panels "zoomed" to 7-wide, including top/bottom borders as full frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)

(Essential for identifying and copying full border rows; simple and accurate.)

    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    return [row[left]] + content + [row[right]]
```
(Core extraction logic; correctly grabs frames + limited inner content to fit 7-wide; add padding/truncation in main function as needed.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Panel selection rule; handles special cases for early sections and alternates for later ones; clamping with min(panel_idx, num_panels-1) prevents errors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic section detection, border copying, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely simpler grids with 2-3 panels and fewer sections).
 * Worked well for frame color detection and border row identification, as training passed without errors.
 * Panel extraction via extract_panel_row produced correct 7-wide outputs with frames intact for training.
 * choose_panel_index correctly selected panels for early sections (0,1,2) in training, suggesting the rules match those examples.
 * Did not fail on bounds or empty grids in training, showing robust in_section tracking and skipping.
 * However, for more complex cases like the test (multiple identical sections), it may over-rely on assuming consistent num_panels; if test has varying panels per section, selection could pick wrong (e.g., index 2 invalid if only 2 panels).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, etc.) are relevant and worked for training—none are broken, but main loop could improve section ending detection if borders are missed.
 * Overall, core structure (while loop scanning rows, starting sections on non-borders) is solid but untested on repetition or asymmetry.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 4 repeated sections (each: top border [4]*7, 6 content rows like [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] down to patterns with 1s, bottom border [4]*7), followed by an extra border, totaling ~29 rows with identical content across sections.
 * This suggests the program detected 4 sections, extracted the same panel (likely index 0 or leftmost, given consistent starting 4,8,... patterns) from each, assuming num_panels >=2 and sections have identical inner content (8 as background, 1 as details like shapes or letters).
 * The output makes sense structurally (preserves frames, 7-wide, section separation) and matches extraction rules: e.g., first content [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] implies 5 inner 8s from a wider panel; later rows show sliced content like [8,1,1,8,1] which could be partial shapes.
 * However, repetition of identical sections implies the input grid has symmetric or tiled content, but if choose_panel_index intended variety (e.g., section 0 picks index 2/middle, section 1 picks 0/left), the identical output suggests either all sections have 3+ panels with middle identical to left, or logic fell back to left (e.g., due to num_panels=2 clamping index 2 to 1, but still same if symmetric).
 * It does not look fully correct if the puzzle expects different panels per section (e.g., varying images); the uniformity might miss subtle differences in input panels, or fail to alternate properly for later sections (idx 3 should pick last if even). Unknown why identical—possibly input is repetitive, but expected output should show progression/variation if selecting different panels.
 * Positive: No crashes or invalid rows; patterns like [8,1,1,8,1] resemble sliced comic elements (e.g., letters 'B' or shapes in 1s), so extraction works, but verify if it matches expected by mentally simulating: if test input has 3 panels per section with distinct content, output should differ across sections, not repeat identically.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where a large grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows (all one color), and each section contains multiple vertical panels defined by frame-colored borders; the goal is to extract a specific 7-column-wide panel from each section based on the section's index, including borders and up to 5 content cells, then output these panels in sequence with horizontal borders preserved, padding short rows to exactly 7 columns with the frame color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 4 in the test output); all borders (horizontal full rows and vertical panel dividers) use this color, but content uses other values (e.g., 8 as filler/background, 1 as distinct elements).
 * Horizontal borders are full rows of frame color only; content sections are contiguous rows between them without full frame rows.
 * In content rows, vertical borders are positions where frame color appears; panels are defined between consecutive border positions (left border + content + right border).
 * Panel selection is deterministic per section index: e.g., 3rd panel (index 2) for section 0, 1st (index 0) for section 1, middle or last for section 2 depending on count, and alternating first/last for later sections—ensuring index doesn't exceed available panels.
 * Extraction per row: Slice from chosen left border to right border, include left/right values, take up to 5 content cells between them; if the slice yields fewer than 7 total columns, pad right with frame color (subtle: never truncate if more than 5 content, but cap content at 5 to fit 7-wide).
 * Sections must have at least 2 border positions to be valid; skip invalid ones.
 * Output preserves structure: full 7-wide frame rows for horizontal borders, and 7-wide panel rows for content sections.
 * Easy to miss: Padding only happens if <7 after extraction (e.g., narrow panels); assume consistent grid width, but panels may vary; section indexing starts at 0 and increments after each content block.
 * Content may include non-frame colors like 8 (possibly background) and 1 (patterns/objects); extraction should preserve these exactly without alteration.
 * Global considerations: Empty grid returns empty; handle variable panel counts per section; no vertical borders in output beyond the chosen panel's left/right.

    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; the program correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, accurately detecting frame color, borders, sections, and panel selection to produce valid outputs.
 * Worked: Proper sectioning with horizontal border detection and skipping invalid sections; consistent 7-wide extraction with padding; panel index choice handled variable num_panels and clamped to valid range.
 * Did not work (or potentially): In the test, the program produced identical panel patterns across all four sections (each a 6-row block of 4/8/1 patterns), which suggests it may be selecting panels with identical content or failing to vary selection correctly if the input panels differ—unknown without input grid, but repetition implies possible bug in section_idx increment or border detection if sections aren't truly identical.
 * choose_panel_index is essential and seems correct for varying selections (e.g., index 2 for section 0, 0 for 1, etc.), but if test has >3 panels or non-3, the logic for section 2+ might not align if panels differ.
 * extract_panel_row is helpful for precise slicing but caps content at 5, which worked for training; however, if test panels have >5 content cells, it truncates them (subtle omission: may lose data if panels are wide).
 * get_border_positions assumes all frame occurrences are borders, which worked for training but could misfire if frame color appears in content (not seen in outputs).
 * Overall, core logic demonstrates understanding of bordering and extraction, but test repetition hints at over-simplification or input-specific issue (e.g., all sections having symmetric panels).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks: each starts with a 7-wide horizontal border of [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], followed by 6 content rows of a consistent 7-wide panel pattern (borders 4, background 8s, and 1s in positions forming a shape like a figure-8 or connected blobs: e.g., row2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]), ending with another border; the entire output is 29 rows, symmetric and repetitive.
 * This does not look fully correct because the identical patterns across sections suggest the program is extracting the same panel type (e.g., always a middle or similar panel with the 8/1 shape) from potentially different input sections—if the test input has varying panels per section (as implied by puzzle needing specific index selection), the output should show different 1-patterns or contents per block, not repetition; the sameness indicates possible failure to detect unique vertical borders or apply varying panel_idx correctly.
 * The patterns themselves make sense internally (preserved colors, exact 7-width, padding not needed as slices fit), but the lack of variation across sections is suspicious and differs from expected diversity in a multi-section puzzle; unknown if input is symmetric, but it feels like over-extraction of one panel archetype.
 * No empty or skipped sections apparent, and borders are correctly output as full 4s, but if test has 3+ panels per section, the choice logic (e.g., index 2 for first section) might be pulling the same shaped panel each time coincidentally.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a consistent frame color (borders) around sections of content, where sections are separated by full horizontal border rows, and each section contains multiple vertical panels delimited by frame-colored vertical lines. The goal is to process the input grid by identifying sections, selecting a specific panel from each based on a patterned index rule (e.g., middle for first section, left for second), extracting each as a standardized 7-column wide panel (preserving borders and padding content to fit), and stacking them vertically into an output grid of the same height but fixed 7-width, with border rows preserved as full frame lines.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always taken from the top-left cell (g[0][0]) and assumed consistent across all borders; empty grids default to 0.
 * Horizontal border rows are entire rows of only the frame color and must be output as full 7-wide frame rows; they also signal section boundaries, incrementing the section index after processing a section.
 * Within a non-border row, vertical borders are positions with frame color; panels are the regions between consecutive vertical borders (num_panels = len(border_pos) - 1).
 * If no vertical borders (num_panels == 0), treat the whole row as a single panel spanning 0 to min(7, W).
 * Panel selection follows a specific pattern by section_idx: for section 0, pick the 3rd panel (index 2, assuming at least 3); for section 1, pick the 1st (index 0); for section 2, pick index 1 if exactly 3 panels else the last; for later sections, alternate starting with index 0 for odd section_idx and last for even.
 * Panel extraction: For each content row in a section, take left border value + up to 5 content cells immediately after left up to but not including right border + right border value; truncate to 7 columns, pad right with frame color if under 7 (never left-pad or expand beyond 5 content).
 * Sections start on the first non-border row after a border, and the same left/right positions are used for all rows in the section until the next border row.
 * Output maintains original height H, but all rows are forced to exactly 7 columns; border rows are always [frame_c] * 7.
 * Subtlety: If a section has fewer panels than the selection index, clamp to num_panels - 1 (e.g., choose_panel_index mins to valid range).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; single-panel sections use full width; content shorter than 5 cells gets padded; vertical borders might not align perfectly across rows, but positions are detected per row—however, the code assumes consistent positions per section by setting once at section start.
 * Potential miss: The pattern for choose_panel_index is heuristic-based on "observed pattern" from training, which may not generalize if test has different panel counts or section behaviors; alternating for later sections assumes a zigzag selection.
 * Another subtlety: Content extraction slices row[content_start:content_end][:5], which caps at 5 even if more available, ensuring fixed inner width.

 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of frame detection, sectioning, panel selection, and 7-wide extraction.
 * The choose_panel_index heuristic worked for training but may be overfitted; for sections beyond 2, the alternating 0/last logic assumes a pattern that might not hold if test sections have varying panel counts or different selection rules (e.g., always middle, or cyclic).
 * Border position detection via get_border_positions is helpful and correctly identifies vertical delimiters per row, but setting left/right only at section start (on first content row) assumes consistent borders across the section—could fail if borders shift row-to-row.
 * extract_panel_row correctly caps content at 5 and pads, preserving borders, which aligned with training expectations.
 * is_border_row and get_frame_color are solid and essential for identifying structure without errors in training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index may need refinement for generalization.
 * Training 1 and 2 passed fully, including proper panel selection and output formatting, but no specific mismatches detailed (assumed exact match to expected).
 * Potential issue: If training had fewer sections, the alternating logic for section_idx > 2 wasn't tested, leading to possible overconfidence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row by 7-column grid with frame color 4, inner color 8 for borders/sub-borders, and 1s for content; it consists of 4 identical 7-row panels (each a bordered shape with 1s forming a partial figure or letter-like pattern) separated by single full-4 border rows, repeating the exact same panel 4 times.
 * This does not look correct, as it suggests the program is selecting and extracting the same panel (likely index 2 or similar, with consistent left/right positions like columns for 8-1-8 patterns) for every section, resulting in repetitive output instead of varied panels from different sections.
 * Expected output should likely vary per section (e.g., different panel indices yielding unique 1-patterns or shapes per 7-row block), stacking distinct extracted panels while preserving borders; the repetition indicates a failure in choose_panel_index to alternate or select differently for sections 0-3, or possibly misdetecting num_panels per section (e.g., always seeing 3+ panels and picking the same one).
 * The patterns within each block (e.g., row 1: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4]; row 2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]; etc.) show proper 7-wide formatting and padding, but the lack of variation across blocks means it's not capturing the puzzle's intent of composing a composite image from specific panels—probably the test input has 4 sections with multiple panels each (e.g., 3-4 panels), and correct selection should yield a progressive or combined figure (unknown exact expected, but repetition is a clear red flag).
 * Subtle difference: If test sections have varying num_panels (e.g., some with 2 panels, triggering last index), the clamp in choose_panel_index might still pick similarly; output height matches (28 rows implies original H=28 with borders), but content sameness differs from expected diversity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row consists only of the frame color."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Finds vertical border column positions in the first non-border row of the current section."""
    frame_c = get_frame_color(g)
    r = 0
    H = len(g)
    while r < H and is_border_row(g[r], frame_c):
        r += 1
    if r == H:
        return []
    row = g[r]
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_starts_and_rights(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left-start and right-end positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:30:49] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (g) with a consistent frame color (e.g., 4) bordering sections of content, where each section contains one or more panels (sub-grids) separated by vertical borders of the frame color. The goal is to detect sections, select a specific panel from each based on section index and number of panels, extract and pad/trim those panels to 7-column rows, and output a sequence of 7-element rows representing the chosen panels across all sections, preserving non-border content while framing with the frame color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows fully filled with the frame color; these must be output as full 7-element frame rows but do not delimit sections internally.
 * Sections are delimited by non-border rows starting with frame color positions indicating panel boundaries; valid panels require at least 7 columns between borders (border_pos[i] + 7 <= width).
 * Panel selection is rule-based on section index (e.g., third panel for first section, first for second, middle or last for others), which may vary by number of panels (e.g., 1 if exactly 3, else last).
 * Extraction must handle variable panel widths: take content between left+1 and right (up to 5 inner cells), frame with left/right values (or frame_c if out of bounds), and pad right with frame_c to reach exactly 7 columns, trimming if longer.
 * Empty sections (no valid panels) are skipped entirely, advancing past non-border rows.
 * Subtle: Border detection relies on exact matches to frame_c; partial borders or non-frame separators might break this. Section indexing increments only after processing a full section. Width is assumed consistent across rows (len(g[0])). Padding assumes 7-column output; content slicing [:5] limits inner width to prevent overflow.
 * Edge cases: Zero-height grid returns empty; single-row sections; sections with 0,1,2+ panels; borders at edges (left=0 or right=width); non-square panels vertically (process row-by-row until next border).
 * Global: Frame color is top-left cell (g[0][0]); assumes uniform. Output height matches processed content rows + border rows encountered.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This reliably detects the frame color from top-left, assuming consistent framing; useful as a starting point.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Essential for detecting and handling full horizontal borders; outputs them as padded frame rows.)

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```
(Key for finding vertical border starts in section rows; filters to positions where panels can fit (border_pos[i] + 7 <= width).)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if num_panels == 0:
        return 0
    cand = 0
    if section_idx == 0:
        cand = 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        cand = 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        cand = 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        cand = 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
    return min(cand, num_panels - 1)
```
(Critical selection logic; handles section-specific choices like third panel first, first second, middle/last third, alternating first/last thereafter; caps at valid range.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int, frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    W = len(row)
    lval = row[left] if left < W else frame_c
    rval = row[right] if right < W else frame_c
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    out_row = [lval] + content + [rval]
    while len(out_row) < 7:
        out_row.append(frame_c)
    return out_row[:7]
```
(Very helpful for per-row extraction; correctly frames content, limits to 5 inner cells, pads right with frame_c to 7, trims if needed; handles edge bounds.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both by accurately detecting frames, sections, panels, and extracting with proper selection and padding.
 * Worked well for section detection and skipping empties; border row handling preserved structure.
 * choose_panel_index logic succeeded for training cases, suggesting it matches the panel selection rule (e.g., prioritizing later panels in early sections).
 * extract_panel_row functioned as intended, producing 7-column outputs with framed content.
 * Potential issue: For sections with >3 panels or unusual widths, the alternating logic (for section_idx >=3) might select incorrectly if the rule is stricter.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes fixed 7-column output and 5-max inner content, which worked for training but could clip wide panels.
 * get_border_positions is helpful and correct; filters valid panels properly.
 * Overall, core logic (frame detection, section looping, panel choice, row extraction) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here—all contributed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 28 rows, structured as four repeated blocks: each block starts with a full frame row of [4]*7, followed by 6 rows of a patterned panel (8/1 content framed by 4's), then another full frame row.
 * Each panel pattern is identical across blocks: row1: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4]; row2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]; row3: [4,8,1,8,8,1,4]; row4: [4,8,1,1,1,1,4]; row5: [4,8,1,8,8,1,4]; row6: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4].
 * This suggests the test input has four similar sections, each with the same chosen panel extracted (likely the second or third panel if multiple per section, given the 1's and 8's pattern fitting a ~6-7 column panel).
 * The output makes sense structurally: it preserves borders as full frames, extracts consistent 7-column rows with padding (visible in uniform length and right-side 4's), and repeats for multiple sections, indicating the program detected and processed four sections correctly without skipping.
 * However, the perfect repetition across all four sections implies either the test input has identical panels/sections or the selection logic (e.g., always picking index 1 or 2) is too uniform— if the puzzle requires varying selections per section (e.g., different indices for later sections), this might be over-simplifying and not varying enough, though without the input grid, it's hard to confirm if the patterns should differ.
 * No obvious errors like mismatched lengths or ignored content; the 1's and 8's are preserved as non-frame, suggesting extraction sliced correctly between borders.
 * Subtle: If the test input has varying panel counts (e.g., some with 3 panels triggering middle selection), the output should show variation, but uniformity here might indicate all sections had the same num_panels and selected the same relative panel—plausible but worth verifying if the rule expects more diversity.

[2025-10-01 20:30:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid representing a multi-panel comic strip or visual layout, where the input is a wide grid (H rows by W columns, with W > 7) bordered by a consistent frame color, and the goal is to output a narrower 7-column grid (same H rows) by detecting horizontal border rows (full frame color) and, for content sections between borders, extracting and stacking specific 7-wide vertical panels while preserving borders as solid frame rows. The selection of which panel to extract alternates per section (likely left vs. right or similar), with each panel being 7 units wide (including left/right frame borders and 5 content cells), and sections are typically 5 content rows high separated by 1-row borders, totaling structures like border + 5 content + border + ... for ~19 rows total.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is consistently the value at g[0][0], used for all border rows in output; entire input rows that are all frame color must be output as solid [frame_c] * 7 rows.
 * Content sections are delimited by border rows and are usually 5 rows high (not 6), so block indexing must account for skipping or ignoring borders in section counting to avoid misalignment—e.g., after a border, the next 5 rows form a section, then border again.
 * Panels are positioned starting at columns s=0, then every 6 columns (overlapping by 1 due to shared right/left borders?), allowing multiple panels (e.g., 3 for W=19: starts at 0,6,12); each extracted as input_row[s:s+7], including the 1-left-border + 5-content + 1-right-border structure.
 * Alternating selection per section: likely starts with a specific panel (e.g., rightmost for first section, leftmost for second) based on section index (0-based after borders), but the exact parity (even/odd) and starting choice must match patterns—mismatches occur when even sections select right but expected is left, or vice versa.
 * Input H is typically 19 (e.g., border + 5 content + border + 5 + border + 5 + border), and output must exactly match H rows without adding extras; sections may vary slightly in height (e.g., last section 5 rows), so fixed //6 per row can skip or misindex across borders.
 * Subtle pattern variations across sections: even if selecting the same panel position (e.g., leftmost), content differs per section (e.g., first section has symmetric 4 placements like 6-4-6-4-6, second has asymmetric like 4-6-6-6, third mixes like 4-4-4 in middle); this suggests the input has distinct panel contents horizontally, and selection must pick the "correct" one per section to match expected outputs.
 * Overlapping panel starts (s +=6 for 7-wide) implies shared border columns between adjacent panels, which must be handled correctly without duplicating or losing frame consistency.
 * No vertical padding or extension: if H < some value, don't add rows; output rows always 7 wide, even for borders.
 * Potential for varying W across examples (e.g., train2 may have different num_panels, affecting starts and selection indices).
 * Easy to miss: block indexing must reset or count sections properly after each border, not continuously from row 0—(r-1)//6 works partially for fixed 6-high but fails for 5-high + border =6 total per section, causing off-by-one in later sections.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]
```
(This correctly identifies the consistent frame color from top-left; useful and accurate across examples.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(This reliably detects full-frame rows for outputting solid borders; works well, no issues observed.)

```python
def get_panel_starts(W: int) -> List[int]:
    starts = []
    s = 0
    while s + 7 <= W:
        starts.append(s)
        s += 6
    return starts
```
(This generates correct overlapping panel start positions, e.g., [0,6,12] for W=19 assuming 3 panels; helpful for extraction, but assumes fixed overlap—may need adjustment if W varies or panels don't overlap.)

```python
def get_block_index(r: int) -> int:
    return (r - 1) // 6
```
(This attempts to group rows into blocks for alternating selection but is flawed: it doesn't skip borders, leading to incorrect parity for later sections in 5-high content +1 border structures; partially helpful for early blocks but causes mismatches in third section—consider replacing with section-based counting starting after each border.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Overall structure is useful (loop over rows, handle borders, extract slices), but buggy in range(W) instead of range(H), causing extra rows, and alternating logic (even: rightmost p=num_panels-1, odd: leftmost p=0) only partially matches (works for first two sections in train1, fails elsewhere).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt correctly identifies frame color and detects border rows, outputting them as solid 7-wide frame rows, which works perfectly for all border positions in both training examples.
 * Panel start calculation (every 6 columns for 7-wide slices) works to generate valid positions (e.g., 3 panels for presumed W=19), and extraction via input_row[s:s+7] preserves the 1-border +5-content +1-border structure accurately when the correct s is chosen.
 * Alternating selection logic (even block: rightmost panel, odd: leftmost) works for the first section/block in train1 (matches expected pattern with 4-6-4 symmetry) and partially for the second (matches 4-6-6-6 asymmetry up to row12), but fails in the third section of train1 by selecting the wrong panel (generated row16 [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] but expected same; however, row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches, but overall pattern shift suggests wrong parity or index for even blocks in later sections—unknown exact cause, but likely due to (r-1)//6 not resetting after borders).
 * In train2, even the first section mismatches early (generated row5 [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,1,4,3], difference in content positions 4-5: 4,4 vs. 1,4; possibly wrong panel selected or different num_panels/W for train2), and second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches expected, but row5 and later don't—indicates logic works sporadically but not consistently across examples or sections.
 * Major bug: loop uses for r in range(W) instead of range(H), causing output to have W rows (e.g., 29 if W=29?) with extra [frame_c]*7 rows appended after H, leading to INCORRECT for both trainings (extra lines beyond 19) and inflating the generated output length.
 * Block indexing (r-1)//6 assumes 6-high blocks including content+borders but actual sections are 5 content +1 border=6 total; this causes parity flips at wrong rows (e.g., third section treated as even but should be odd or vice versa), leading to wrong panel selection in later parts.
 * No handling for potential varying section heights (e.g., train2 last section fits 5 content rows before final border); fixed //6 doesn't adapt.
 * get_panel_starts is essential and correct for multi-panel layout; is_border_row is essential and correct for delimiting sections.
 * The program doesn't count sections explicitly (e.g., increment section_idx only on non-border rows), leading to misalternation—essential fix for future.
 * Train1 mismatches: third section row16 generated [1,6,4,4,4,6,1] actually matches expected row16, but row17 generated [1,6,6,4,6,6,1] matches expected row17, wait no—upon close check, generated third block shifts patterns (e.g., inserts extra all-6 row at generated row16 where expected has content, due to index error), but exact difference is in positioning of 4's (e.g., expected row16 has 4,4,4 centered, generated may pull from adjacent panel with 4,4,6); unknown why but tied to wrong s selection.
 * Train2 mismatches: first section row3 generated [3,4,1,1,1,4,3] matches expected, row4 matches, but row5 shifts 1's rightward (1,1,4,4 vs. 1,1,1,4—difference in cells 3-5); second section row11 generated [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] but expected [3,4,4,1,4,4,3] matches, yet overall INCORRECT due to extras and other shifts like row17 generated [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] vs. expected [3,4,1,1,4,4,3] wait, some match but cumulative errors from indexing.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant, though get_block_index is broken for section delimiting (don't use as-is; modify to section counter).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: it generates 29 rows instead of the expected ~19 (likely H=19), with extra [4,4,4,4,4,4,4] border rows appended after the input height due to the range(W) bug (assuming W> H, e.g., W=29), which pads unnecessary frame rows and makes the structure invalid.
 * Patterns are inconsistent and likely wrong: frame color is 4 (correct from g[0][0]), but content mixes 8,1,4 in ways that don't align with expected logic—e.g., row2 [8,8,8,4,8,8,8] has internal 4's where content should be uniform or patterned without frame intrusion; row3 [8,1,8,4,8,1,1] has scattered 1's and a central 4 that looks like a misplaced border, not matching any training pattern (e.g., no symmetric 1 placements like train2's 1,1,1); row5 [1,1,8,4,8,1,1] starts with 1's outside expected border positions.
 * Later sections repeat flawed patterns (e.g., row16+ reuses early motifs but with shifts like row20 [4,8,1,8,8,1,8] having 4 as left border but then 8,1 mix), and the entire output lacks clear alternation (e.g., no clean left/right panel distinction; appears to pull random slices), resulting in garbage like row26 [1,1,8,4,8,1,8] which inverts expected content-frame separation.
 * Overall, it doesn't make sense as a valid transformed comic panel stack—looks like buggy slicing from wrong starts/panels, with extra rows making it impossible to verify against puzzle rules; must fix loop and alternation to handle test's unique numbers (4 frame, 8/1 content) without internal frame leaks.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid framed with a consistent border color (e.g., 4), divided into vertical sections or panels separated by border columns, where the goal is to detect these sections, select a specific panel from each based on its index or position, extract and pad the content to a fixed 7-column width (framed with the border color), and output a new grid that skips or simplifies border rows while preserving the chosen panel's internal structure.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows (entirely filled with frame color) that should be output as full 7-column frame rows, but content sections between them need panel extraction.
 * Panels within a section are delimited by vertical border positions (columns matching frame color in non-border rows); the number of panels is typically the count of border positions minus one.
 * Panel selection is rule-based on section index (e.g., first section picks the third panel, second picks the first, third picks the second or last if three panels exist), which handles varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) but may fail if sections have unexpected panel counts.
 * Extraction must slice content between left and right borders, include the borders in the output row, limit inner content to 5 cells (to fit 7 total: left + 5 + right), and pad with frame color if shorter; this assumes fixed-width output per row.
 * Sections end when a border row is encountered, and processing advances row-by-row, incrementing section index only after full sections.
 * Subtle edge cases: empty grid returns empty; single-row sections or no borders fallback to slicing first 7 columns; assumes grid width >=7, but padding handles shorter rows; vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows in a section, but extraction uses per-row border positions (though current code uses fixed left/right from first row, which could miss misalignments).
 * Frame color is always from top-left cell; non-border rows may have partial frame elements (e.g., 8 as a sub-frame color inside panels).
 * Puzzle likely involves symbolic panels (e.g., numbers like 1 and 8 representing shapes or objects), so extraction must preserve internal patterns without alteration.
 * Across attempts, considerations include handling multiple identical sections (test has repeats), ensuring panel choice cycles correctly (e.g., not always picking the same panel), and avoiding over-extraction (e.g., content[:5] limits width).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Extracts the border color from top-left; reliable and simple.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Detects full horizontal borders; essential for section delimiting.)

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```
(Finds vertical border columns in a row; key for panel detection, but note: should ideally be consistent across section rows.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects panel based on section and panel count; works for 2-3 panels but may need generalization for more or varying counts; min() clamp added in code prevents index errors.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int, frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    W = len(row)
    lval = row[left] if left < W else frame_c
    rval = row[right] if right < W else frame_c
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    out_row = [lval] + content + [rval]
    while len(out_row) < 7:
        out_row.append(frame_c)
    return out_row[:7]
```
(Extracts and pads a single row's panel content; helpful but assumes fixed left/right from section start—could be improved to detect per-row borders for jagged sections.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, successfully detecting frames, sections, panel counts, and extracting/padding chosen panels to 7 columns while simplifying borders.
 * Worked well for basic sectioning: border rows output as full frames, content sections process row-by-row until next border, section index increments properly.
 * choose_panel_index logic passed trains, suggesting it matches the rule for selecting specific panels (e.g., third for first section, first for second) in those cases.
 * Fallback for no panels (slice first 7 and pad) wasn't triggered in trains but provides robustness.
 * However, did not work for the test input: output is four identical 7-row patterns (each a framed panel with internal 1s and 8s), repeating the same structure, indicating likely incorrect panel selection across multiple sections—probably always picking the same panel (e.g., index 2 or middle) due to section_idx logic failing on more sections or consistent 3-panel layouts.
 * extract_panel_row is mostly helpful but may over-pad or truncate if content >5 inner cells, though it didn't break trains; subtle issue: uses fixed left/right from first row of section, ignoring potential shifts in later rows (could cause misalignment in test).
 * get_border_positions is useful but computed only on first row of section—recomputing per row might help jagged borders, but wasn't needed for trains.
 * No object extraction functions were used (e.g., no blob detection for 1s/8s as shapes); this attempt treated panels as raw slices, which worked for trains but may miss if puzzle requires interpreting internals (e.g., counting connected 1s).
 * Earlier implicit attempts (inferred from code evolution) likely missed panel cycling, as this version added choose_panel_index to fix selection.
 * is_border_row is solid and not broken.
 * Overall, core sectioning and padding worked, but panel choice and multi-section handling failed test for unknown reasons (possibly test has >3 sections or varying panel counts not covered by choose_panel_index).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks, each 8 rows high (7 content +1 bottom border? but actually 7 per block plus shared borders), with each block showing a consistent pattern: top/bottom full 4s, then rows with 4-8-frames around a panel containing 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], etc.), repeating exactly.
 * This does not look correct because the test input (inferred from output) likely has multiple distinct sections with different panels, but the output extracts the same panel pattern four times, suggesting the program is selecting the same panel index (e.g., always 2 for 3-panel sections) across all sections instead of varying by section_idx.
 * Repetition implies failure to differentiate sections: if test has four sections with 3 panels each, it should output four different panels (e.g., panel2, panel0, panel1, then cycle), but instead it's identical, so probably section_idx isn't advancing correctly or num_panels detection is stuck.
 * The internal panel looks like a specific shape (8s as borders, 1s as content, possibly a symbol like a face or letter), preserved correctly per extraction, but wrong choice makes whole output invalid.
 * Padding to 7 columns works (no overflows), and frame color 4 is consistent, but lack of variation confirms it's not matching expected diverse output.
 * No empty or fallback rows appear, so border detection succeeded, but overall output is uniform where diversity is expected—definitely incorrect.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where a grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows filled entirely with a frame color (e.g., 4), and within each section, vertical frame positions mark the starts of 7-wide panels containing patterns (e.g., with colors like 8 and 1). The goal is to extract and output specific 7-wide panels from each section, choosing one per section based on its index, while preserving or adding border rows as 7-wide frame lines, ultimately forming a composite output image.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell and applies uniformly; all borders must match this exactly for a row to be considered a border.
 * Sections are non-border row groups between border rows; empty sections (no panels) should be skipped without output.
 * Panel starts are identified by frame color positions in non-border rows, but only valid if they allow a full 7-wide extraction (i.e., position +7 <= grid width).
 * Panel selection is deterministic based on section index (0-based count of sections encountered) and number of valid panels in that section; this choice logic must handle varying numbers of panels (e.g., 2 or 3) and cycles through sections correctly.
 * Extraction includes the starting frame column, so output rows begin with the frame color even for content.
 * Output should interleave extracted panel rows with 7-wide frame borders where original borders occurred, but only process until the end of the grid.
 * Subtlety: Section index increments only for sections with panels; border rows trigger frame output but don't increment index.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels == 0 in a section, skip without incrementing index or outputting anything; also, ensure extraction stops at section end (next border or grid end).
 * Handle edge cases like zero-height grid (empty output) or sections with panels that don't span the full height uniformly.
 * The puzzle likely involves selecting panels in a specific order (e.g., middle for first section, left for second) to reveal a hidden image or pattern when combined.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame color from the top-left cell of the grid."""
    return g[0][0]
```

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    """Checks if an entire row is filled with the frame color, indicating a border."""
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    """Finds all column indices in a row where the frame color appears (potential panel starts)."""
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_panel_starts(border_pos: List[int], W: int) -> List[int]:
    """Filters border positions to only those that can start a full 7-wide panel."""
    return [p for p in border_pos[:-1] if p + 7 <= W]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of frame detection, section division, panel start identification, and basic extraction for simpler cases with fewer sections or standard panel counts.
 * The choose_panel_index function worked well for the training cases, likely selecting the correct panel (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second) without over-indexing issues.
 * Border row handling was accurate, outputting [frame_c]*7 correctly and skipping index increment.
 * Section skipping for num_panels==0 was implemented but not tested in training (assumed correct since passes).
 * However, the panel index choice logic may not generalize perfectly; for sections beyond index 2, it defaults to 0 or last based on parity, which might select incorrectly if test has more sections or different num_panels.
 * No unhandled errors like index out-of-bounds, but the fallback if panel_idx >= num_panels sets to last, which could mask selection bugs.
 * Functions like get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, and get_panel_starts are helpful and correct for core extraction; retain them.
 * The main program loop correctly iterates row-by-row, extracting full section heights, but assumes all rows in a section have consistent panel starts (potential subtlety if not).
 * No unhelpful or broken functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be refined for more sections.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 8-row blocks (each: one [4]*7 border, six content rows starting with 4 followed by 8's and 1's patterns, then another [4]*7 border), repeating a specific 6x6 inner pattern (e.g., rows with [8,8,8,8,8,8], [8,1,1,8,1,8], etc.) framed on the left.
 * This looks repetitive and symmetric, suggesting the test input is a tall grid with multiple (at least 4) similar sections separated by border rows, each containing panels with the same content, and the program selected the same relative panel (likely index 0 or 1) from each, resulting in identical extractions.
 * It makes sense if the test input has repeated sections for a "tiled" puzzle effect, and the selection logic chose consistently (e.g., via section_idx parity), but it does not look correct if the puzzle requires selecting different panels per section to form a unique composite image— the repetition implies no variation, which could mean wrong index choices (e.g., always picking the leftmost panel instead of varying like 2,0,1).
 * Observed difference: Expected output might combine different panels (e.g., middle from first section, right from later) to reveal a non-repetitive pattern, but generated is uniform copies; this differs from training (which passed, likely non-repetitive), possibly because test has 3+ panels per section but logic falls back incorrectly for higher section_idx.
 * Without the raw test input grid, can't confirm panel positions, but the output's inclusion of left-frame 4 in content rows is correct per extraction rules; however, the lack of variation suggests the choose_panel_index isn't cycling panels as intended for multi-section tests.
 * The borders are correctly shortened to 7-wide, and extraction stops at section ends, but if test sections have varying heights or panel counts, the uniform blocks indicate either correct (identical input sections) or a bug in index selection.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured with horizontal border rows and vertical borders dividing content into multiple panels per section; the goal is to identify the frame color, detect sections, select a specific panel from each section based on its index, and extract a standardized 7-column representation (left border + 5 content cells + right border) for the chosen panels, while preserving full border rows in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid uses a consistent frame/border color (e.g., 4 in the test output) for all horizontal and vertical borders; this color must be extracted reliably from the top-left cell or similar.
 * Sections are delimited by full horizontal border rows (entire row matching frame color); content rows within a section share the same vertical border positions, allowing consistent panel extraction across the section's height.
 * Panels are defined by consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels varies (e.g., 3-4), and selection logic must choose one per section (e.g., middle or specific index based on section order), but this can be tricky if the pattern isn't uniform across examples.
 * Extraction must take exactly 5 content cells between left and right borders to fit the 7-column output; if the content span is wider, truncate to first 5; borders are included verbatim.
 * Subtlety: Sections may repeat identical content (as in test), leading to repetitive output; ensure the program doesn't skip sections or misalign borders if vertical borders aren't perfectly aligned.
 * Border rows in output should be full 7-cells of frame color; non-border rows must not accidentally include extra borders or truncate incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: If num_panels < expected (e.g., 0 or 1), the program should skip or default gracefully without crashing; section indexing starts from 0 and increments only after processing a full section.
 * Vertical borders may not span the entire row (only at panel edges), so detection must scan each content row independently but assume consistency within a section.
 * Output height matches input but filtered to chosen panels; no rotation, flipping, or color changes—just spatial extraction.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identified frame color, border rows, and vertical borders, successfully extracting panels for training example 1 and 2 (both marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of section detection and 7-column output formatting.
 * The panel selection logic (choose_panel_index) worked for training but may be overly heuristic (e.g., assuming 3-4 panels and fixed indices like panel 2 for section 0), potentially failing if test sections have different panel counts or selection patterns.
 * Extraction of content rows preserved section structure well, including full border rows as [frame_c]*7, but the fallback (panel_idx = num_panels -1 if out of range) prevented crashes.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one highlights that assuming consistent vertical borders within sections is key; unhelpful if borders vary per row (though not observed).
 * Function get_panel_borders is essential and correct for deriving panel edges; choose_panel_index is helpful but brittle—consider making it more data-driven (e.g., based on panel width or content patterns) in future.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index could be broken for variable panel counts (e.g., if test has 2 panels, it might select incorrectly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 29 rows in a repetitive pattern: full border rows of [4]*7 separating identical 6-row panel extractions (borders of 4, content mixing 8 and 1 forming a shape like a letter 'A' or similar symbol), repeated 4 times.
 * This looks partially correct if the input grid has 4 identical sections with multiple panels each, and the program consistently selected the same panel (e.g., one with the 8/1 pattern); it preserves borders and limits to 7 columns properly, with no truncation errors visible.
 * However, the extreme repetition suggests it might be extracting the wrong panel or all similar panels without variation—expected output should likely differ across sections if the puzzle requires selecting distinct panels (e.g., different indices per section); the shape repeats exactly, which may not match a "correct" solution if sections are meant to form a combined image or sequence.
 * It does not look fully correct because the choose_panel_index likely defaulted to the same panel repeatedly (e.g., index 2 or last), ignoring potential differences in section_idx; if the test input has varying panel contents, this would homogenize them incorrectly.
 * No crashes or malformed rows (all 7 elements, consistent frame 4), but the output's uniformity across sections indicates a subtlety missed: panel selection may need to cycle or alternate differently (e.g., left/middle/right sequentially) rather than fixed indices.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid structured like framed sections (e.g., comic panels or divided regions) separated by solid border rows of a uniform frame color, where each section contains multiple sub-panels divided by vertical frame lines, and the goal is to extract and output a specific sub-panel from each section based on rules tied to the section's position, resizing it to a standard 7-column width while preserving the frame borders.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts and ends with (and is separated by) full border rows consisting entirely of the frame color (e.g., all 4s), which act as dividers between sections; these must be copied verbatim to the output as 7-wide rows of frame color.
 * Frame color is determined from the top-left cell (or 0 if empty), assuming it's consistent across the grid; borders in sections are vertical lines of this color separating sub-panels.
 * Each non-border section has a variable number of sub-panels (num_panels = number of border positions - 1), identified by positions where the row hits the frame color; extraction targets a specific sub-panel index per section (e.g., index 2 for first section, 0 for second, etc.), falling back to valid ranges if needed.
 * Sub-panel extraction slices content between left and right border positions, taking exactly the left border value, the first 5 content cells (to standardize width), and the right border value, resulting in 7-column rows; this is applied row-by-row for the entire section height until the next border row.
 * Sections without panels (no borders found) are skipped entirely, advancing past them without output.
 * Section index increments only after processing a valid section with panels, ensuring selection logic applies sequentially to content-bearing sections.
 * Subtle: Vertical borders may not align perfectly across rows (but code assumes they do for extraction); content may include colors like 8 (possibly inner frames or fillers) or 1 (patterns), which are preserved as-is without interpretation.
 * Easy to miss: Overly wide sections may have content beyond the 5-slice, leading to truncation; fallback logic (e.g., panel_idx = num_panels - 1 if out of range) prevents crashes but may select wrong panels; repetitive sections in input could lead to near-identical outputs if selection always picks similar sub-panels.
 * All attempts must handle empty grids (return empty list) and ensure output rows are exactly 7 elements; no rotation, flipping, or merging of extracted panels—output stacks them sequentially with borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(Identifies the uniform frame color from top-left; essential for detecting borders and assuming consistency.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Checks if a row is a full horizontal border; key for section delimiting and copying borders to output.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    left_val = row[left]
    content = row[left + 1:right][:5]
    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```
(Cores extraction logic: grabs left/right borders and exactly 5 inner cells to standardize to 7 columns; handles variable widths by truncation, preserving frame values.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Selects which sub-panel to extract based on section order and panel count; includes fallbacks for varying num_panels, e.g., picks middle-ish or edge panels; crucial for puzzle's selection rule.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed both training examples, correctly identifying frame color, detecting border rows, extracting the right sub-panel per section, and standardizing to 7 columns without errors.
 * The section-skipping logic for empty sections worked, as did incrementing section_idx only after valid extractions.
 * choose_panel_index handled specific cases (e.g., index 2 for first section, assuming at least 3 panels) with fallbacks, which aligned with training data.
 * extract_panel_row's 5-content slice correctly truncated wider panels, preserving borders as frame color.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes vertical borders align across section rows (uses first row's positions for all), which could fail if misaligned—though it worked for training.
 * get_frame_color and is_border_row are robust and essential; no unhelpful functions here, but prior attempts (implied) might have lacked fallback in choose_panel_index, causing index errors on low-panel sections.
 * Overall, core loop (while r < H, check border vs. section start) effectively parsed structure without overcomplicating.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 8 stacked sections (each ~7 rows high), starting/ending with full [4]*7 border rows, and inner sections showing 7-column panels with left/right 4 borders, inner 8s (likely filler or sub-frame), and patterns of 1s and 8s (e.g., [4,8,1,1,8,1,4], [4,8,1,8,8,1,4], etc.); sections are nearly identical, repeating the same 5-row pattern of 1/8 arrangements flanked by 8-filled rows.
 * This looks partially correct in structure (borders copied, extractions standardized to 7 columns, sections delimited), but suspicious due to high repetition—suggests the test input has multiple similar multi-panel sections (e.g., 4+ panels each), and the program consistently selected a sub-panel with 8-heavy content and simple 1 patterns, possibly the second or third panel if sections have 3+ panels.
 * It does not look fully correct because the patterns (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s or blobs) across the 5 content columns seem truncated or simplistic; expected output might combine or select varying sub-panels (e.g., alternating left/middle/right) to form a progressive puzzle image, but here all sections output near-identical panels, missing variety—possibly wrong panel selection for later sections (e.g., choose_panel_index's else clause picking edges too predictably).
 * The 8s as inner elements are preserved correctly (not treated as frames), but if the puzzle intends 8s as secondary borders, extraction might need nested slicing (not handled); output height matches multi-section input, but without the actual test grid, the repetition implies over-extraction or input similarity, differing from expected by lacking diversity in selected content.
 * Note: The output is different from a "correct" expectation of a single cohesive image or varied panel sequence; it's a stack of similar extracts, which may not solve the visual puzzle (e.g., if goal is to reveal a hidden picture by picking specific panels).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors) structured as framed sections, likely resembling comic panels or divided images, where the task is to extract and output a specific 7-cell-wide panel from each section based on section index and number of panels, preserving frames and inner content while handling borders and varying panel counts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows that are entirely one color (frame color, often 4), separating vertical sections; these must be copied as full 7-cell frame rows in output.
 * Within sections, panels are vertically aligned and separated by vertical frame-color columns (also 4); the number of panels is one less than the number of frame positions in a row.
 * Panel extraction takes the left and right frame cells, plus up to 5 inner content cells (sliced from left+1 to right, taking first 5), always outputting exactly 7 cells per row (pad with frame color if short, truncate if long, though grids seem designed to fit).
 * Panel selection depends on section index (0-based, incrementing per section) and number of panels: e.g., section 0 picks the 3rd panel (index 2), section 1 picks first (0), section 2 picks middle (1) or last if not 3 panels, later sections alternate first/last based on parity.
 * Frame color is determined from top-left cell; assume consistent across grid.
 * Sections must be detected by transitioning from border to non-border rows; invalid sections (no panels) are skipped.
 * Subtleties: Ensure bounds checking to avoid index errors; content rows may have varying widths but extraction assumes W is consistent; repeated identical sections in test suggest symmetric or patterned input, but selection logic must handle varying num_panels (e.g., 2 vs 3 panels changes section 2 choice).
 * Easy to miss: Padding only with frame color if under 7; not all sections have the same num_panels, so min() clamp in panel_idx prevents overflow; vertical alignment assumes all rows in section have same border positions.
 * Overall output maintains section structure with extracted panels "zoomed" to 7-wide, including top/bottom borders as full frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This reliably detects the frame color from top-left, assuming consistent framing.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Essential for identifying and copying full border rows; simple and accurate.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    return [row[left]] + content + [row[right]]
```
(Core extraction logic; correctly grabs frames + limited inner content to fit 7-wide; add padding/truncation in main function as needed.)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
(Panel selection rule; handles special cases for early sections and alternates for later ones; clamping with min(panel_idx, num_panels-1) prevents errors.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully passed Training example 1 and 2, indicating correct handling of basic section detection, border copying, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely simpler grids with 2-3 panels and fewer sections).
 * Worked well for frame color detection and border row identification, as training passed without errors.
 * Panel extraction via extract_panel_row produced correct 7-wide outputs with frames intact for training.
 * choose_panel_index correctly selected panels for early sections (0,1,2) in training, suggesting the rules match those examples.
 * Did not fail on bounds or empty grids in training, showing robust in_section tracking and skipping.
 * However, for more complex cases like the test (multiple identical sections), it may over-rely on assuming consistent num_panels; if test has varying panels per section, selection could pick wrong (e.g., index 2 invalid if only 2 panels).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, etc.) are relevant and worked for training—none are broken, but main loop could improve section ending detection if borders are missed.
 * Overall, core structure (while loop scanning rows, starting sections on non-borders) is solid but untested on repetition or asymmetry.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 4 repeated sections (each: top border [4]*7, 6 content rows like [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] down to patterns with 1s, bottom border [4]*7), followed by an extra border, totaling ~29 rows with identical content across sections.
 * This suggests the program detected 4 sections, extracted the same panel (likely index 0 or leftmost, given consistent starting 4,8,... patterns) from each, assuming num_panels >=2 and sections have identical inner content (8 as background, 1 as details like shapes or letters).
 * The output makes sense structurally (preserves frames, 7-wide, section separation) and matches extraction rules: e.g., first content [4,8,8,8,8,8,4] implies 5 inner 8s from a wider panel; later rows show sliced content like [8,1,1,8,1] which could be partial shapes.
 * However, repetition of identical sections implies the input grid has symmetric or tiled content, but if choose_panel_index intended variety (e.g., section 0 picks index 2/middle, section 1 picks 0/left), the identical output suggests either all sections have 3+ panels with middle identical to left, or logic fell back to left (e.g., due to num_panels=2 clamping index 2 to 1, but still same if symmetric).
 * It does not look fully correct if the puzzle expects different panels per section (e.g., varying images); the uniformity might miss subtle differences in input panels, or fail to alternate properly for later sections (idx 3 should pick last if even). Unknown why identical—possibly input is repetitive, but expected output should show progression/variation if selecting different panels.
 * Positive: No crashes or invalid rows; patterns like [8,1,1,8,1] resemble sliced comic elements (e.g., letters 'B' or shapes in 1s), so extraction works, but verify if it matches expected by mentally simulating: if test input has 3 panels per section with distinct content, output should differ across sections, not repeat identically.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-processing puzzle where a large grid is divided into sections by horizontal border rows (all one color), and each section contains multiple vertical panels defined by frame-colored borders; the goal is to extract a specific 7-column-wide panel from each section based on the section's index, including borders and up to 5 content cells, then output these panels in sequence with horizontal borders preserved, padding short rows to exactly 7 columns with the frame color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always the top-left cell's value (e.g., 4 in the test output); all borders (horizontal full rows and vertical panel dividers) use this color, but content uses other values (e.g., 8 as filler/background, 1 as distinct elements).
 * Horizontal borders are full rows of frame color only; content sections are contiguous rows between them without full frame rows.
 * In content rows, vertical borders are positions where frame color appears; panels are defined between consecutive border positions (left border + content + right border).
 * Panel selection is deterministic per section index: e.g., 3rd panel (index 2) for section 0, 1st (index 0) for section 1, middle or last for section 2 depending on count, and alternating first/last for later sections—ensuring index doesn't exceed available panels.
 * Extraction per row: Slice from chosen left border to right border, include left/right values, take up to 5 content cells between them; if the slice yields fewer than 7 total columns, pad right with frame color (subtle: never truncate if more than 5 content, but cap content at 5 to fit 7-wide).
 * Sections must have at least 2 border positions to be valid; skip invalid ones.
 * Output preserves structure: full 7-wide frame rows for horizontal borders, and 7-wide panel rows for content sections.
 * Easy to miss: Padding only happens if <7 after extraction (e.g., narrow panels); assume consistent grid width, but panels may vary; section indexing starts at 0 and increments after each content block.
 * Content may include non-frame colors like 8 (possibly background) and 1 (patterns/objects); extraction should preserve these exactly without alteration.
 * Global considerations: Empty grid returns empty; handle variable panel counts per section; no vertical borders in output beyond the chosen panel's left/right.

    right_val = row[right]
    return [left_val] + content + [right_val]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; the program correctly processed training examples 1 and 2, accurately detecting frame color, borders, sections, and panel selection to produce valid outputs.
 * Worked: Proper sectioning with horizontal border detection and skipping invalid sections; consistent 7-wide extraction with padding; panel index choice handled variable num_panels and clamped to valid range.
 * Did not work (or potentially): In the test, the program produced identical panel patterns across all four sections (each a 6-row block of 4/8/1 patterns), which suggests it may be selecting panels with identical content or failing to vary selection correctly if the input panels differ—unknown without input grid, but repetition implies possible bug in section_idx increment or border detection if sections aren't truly identical.
 * choose_panel_index is essential and seems correct for varying selections (e.g., index 2 for section 0, 0 for 1, etc.), but if test has >3 panels or non-3, the logic for section 2+ might not align if panels differ.
 * extract_panel_row is helpful for precise slicing but caps content at 5, which worked for training; however, if test panels have >5 content cells, it truncates them (subtle omission: may lose data if panels are wide).
 * get_border_positions assumes all frame occurrences are borders, which worked for training but could misfire if frame color appears in content (not seen in outputs).
 * Overall, core logic demonstrates understanding of bordering and extraction, but test repetition hints at over-simplification or input-specific issue (e.g., all sections having symmetric panels).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical blocks: each starts with a 7-wide horizontal border of [4,4,4,4,4,4,4], followed by 6 content rows of a consistent 7-wide panel pattern (borders 4, background 8s, and 1s in positions forming a shape like a figure-8 or connected blobs: e.g., row2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]), ending with another border; the entire output is 29 rows, symmetric and repetitive.
 * This does not look fully correct because the identical patterns across sections suggest the program is extracting the same panel type (e.g., always a middle or similar panel with the 8/1 shape) from potentially different input sections—if the test input has varying panels per section (as implied by puzzle needing specific index selection), the output should show different 1-patterns or contents per block, not repetition; the sameness indicates possible failure to detect unique vertical borders or apply varying panel_idx correctly.
 * The patterns themselves make sense internally (preserved colors, exact 7-width, padding not needed as slices fit), but the lack of variation across sections is suspicious and differs from expected diversity in a multi-section puzzle; unknown if input is symmetric, but it feels like over-extraction of one panel archetype.
 * No empty or skipped sections apparent, and borders are correctly output as full 4s, but if test has 3+ panels per section, the choice logic (e.g., index 2 for first section) might be pulling the same shaped panel each time coincidentally.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with a consistent frame color (borders) around sections of content, where sections are separated by full horizontal border rows, and each section contains multiple vertical panels delimited by frame-colored vertical lines. The goal is to process the input grid by identifying sections, selecting a specific panel from each based on a patterned index rule (e.g., middle for first section, left for second), extracting each as a standardized 7-column wide panel (preserving borders and padding content to fit), and stacking them vertically into an output grid of the same height but fixed 7-width, with border rows preserved as full frame lines.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Frame color is always taken from the top-left cell (g[0][0]) and assumed consistent across all borders; empty grids default to 0.
 * Horizontal border rows are entire rows of only the frame color and must be output as full 7-wide frame rows; they also signal section boundaries, incrementing the section index after processing a section.
 * Within a non-border row, vertical borders are positions with frame color; panels are the regions between consecutive vertical borders (num_panels = len(border_pos) - 1).
 * If no vertical borders (num_panels == 0), treat the whole row as a single panel spanning 0 to min(7, W).
 * Panel selection follows a specific pattern by section_idx: for section 0, pick the 3rd panel (index 2, assuming at least 3); for section 1, pick the 1st (index 0); for section 2, pick index 1 if exactly 3 panels else the last; for later sections, alternate starting with index 0 for odd section_idx and last for even.
 * Panel extraction: For each content row in a section, take left border value + up to 5 content cells immediately after left up to but not including right border + right border value; truncate to 7 columns, pad right with frame color if under 7 (never left-pad or expand beyond 5 content).
 * Sections start on the first non-border row after a border, and the same left/right positions are used for all rows in the section until the next border row.
 * Output maintains original height H, but all rows are forced to exactly 7 columns; border rows are always [frame_c] * 7.
 * Subtlety: If a section has fewer panels than the selection index, clamp to num_panels - 1 (e.g., choose_panel_index mins to valid range).
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; single-panel sections use full width; content shorter than 5 cells gets padded; vertical borders might not align perfectly across rows, but positions are detected per row—however, the code assumes consistent positions per section by setting once at section start.
 * Potential miss: The pattern for choose_panel_index is heuristic-based on "observed pattern" from training, which may not generalize if test has different panel counts or section behaviors; alternating for later sections assumes a zigzag selection.
 * Another subtlety: Content extraction slices row[content_start:content_end][:5], which caps at 5 even if more available, ensuring fixed inner width.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of frame detection, sectioning, panel selection, and 7-wide extraction.
 * The choose_panel_index heuristic worked for training but may be overfitted; for sections beyond 2, the alternating 0/last logic assumes a pattern that might not hold if test sections have varying panel counts or different selection rules (e.g., always middle, or cyclic).
 * Border position detection via get_border_positions is helpful and correctly identifies vertical delimiters per row, but setting left/right only at section start (on first content row) assumes consistent borders across the section—could fail if borders shift row-to-row.
 * extract_panel_row correctly caps content at 5 and pads, preserving borders, which aligned with training expectations.
 * is_border_row and get_frame_color are solid and essential for identifying structure without errors in training.
 * No unhelpful functions noted in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though choose_panel_index may need refinement for generalization.
 * Training 1 and 2 passed fully, including proper panel selection and output formatting, but no specific mismatches detailed (assumed exact match to expected).
 * Potential issue: If training had fewer sections, the alternating logic for section_idx > 2 wasn't tested, leading to possible overconfidence.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row by 7-column grid with frame color 4, inner color 8 for borders/sub-borders, and 1s for content; it consists of 4 identical 7-row panels (each a bordered shape with 1s forming a partial figure or letter-like pattern) separated by single full-4 border rows, repeating the exact same panel 4 times.
 * This does not look correct, as it suggests the program is selecting and extracting the same panel (likely index 2 or similar, with consistent left/right positions like columns for 8-1-8 patterns) for every section, resulting in repetitive output instead of varied panels from different sections.
 * Expected output should likely vary per section (e.g., different panel indices yielding unique 1-patterns or shapes per 7-row block), stacking distinct extracted panels while preserving borders; the repetition indicates a failure in choose_panel_index to alternate or select differently for sections 0-3, or possibly misdetecting num_panels per section (e.g., always seeing 3+ panels and picking the same one).
 * The patterns within each block (e.g., row 1: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4]; row 2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]; etc.) show proper 7-wide formatting and padding, but the lack of variation across blocks means it's not capturing the puzzle's intent of composing a composite image from specific panels—probably the test input has 4 sections with multiple panels each (e.g., 3-4 panels), and correct selection should yield a progressive or combined figure (unknown exact expected, but repetition is a clear red flag).
 * Subtle difference: If test sections have varying num_panels (e.g., some with 2 panels, triggering last index), the clamp in choose_panel_index might still pick similarly; output height matches (28 rows implies original H=28 with borders), but content sameness differs from expected diversity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid (g) with a consistent frame color (e.g., 4) bordering sections of content, where each section contains one or more panels (sub-grids) separated by vertical borders of the frame color. The goal is to detect sections, select a specific panel from each based on section index and number of panels, extract and pad/trim those panels to 7-column rows, and output a sequence of 7-element rows representing the chosen panels across all sections, preserving non-border content while framing with the frame color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has horizontal border rows fully filled with the frame color; these must be output as full 7-element frame rows but do not delimit sections internally.
 * Sections are delimited by non-border rows starting with frame color positions indicating panel boundaries; valid panels require at least 7 columns between borders (border_pos[i] + 7 <= width).
 * Panel selection is rule-based on section index (e.g., third panel for first section, first for second, middle or last for others), which may vary by number of panels (e.g., 1 if exactly 3, else last).
 * Extraction must handle variable panel widths: take content between left+1 and right (up to 5 inner cells), frame with left/right values (or frame_c if out of bounds), and pad right with frame_c to reach exactly 7 columns, trimming if longer.
 * Empty sections (no valid panels) are skipped entirely, advancing past non-border rows.
 * Subtle: Border detection relies on exact matches to frame_c; partial borders or non-frame separators might break this. Section indexing increments only after processing a full section. Width is assumed consistent across rows (len(g[0])). Padding assumes 7-column output; content slicing [:5] limits inner width to prevent overflow.
 * Edge cases: Zero-height grid returns empty; single-row sections; sections with 0,1,2+ panels; borders at edges (left=0 or right=width); non-square panels vertically (process row-by-row until next border).
 * Global: Frame color is top-left cell (g[0][0]); assumes uniform. Output height matches processed content rows + border rows encountered.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This reliably detects the frame color from top-left, assuming consistent framing; useful as a starting point.)

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
(Essential for detecting and handling full horizontal borders; outputs them as padded frame rows.)

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```
(Key for finding vertical border starts in section rows; filters to positions where panels can fit (border_pos[i] + 7 <= width).)

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if num_panels == 0:
        return 0
    cand = 0
    if section_idx == 0:
        cand = 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        cand = 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        cand = 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        cand = 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
    return min(cand, num_panels - 1)
```
(Critical selection logic; handles section-specific choices like third panel first, first second, middle/last third, alternating first/last thereafter; caps at valid range.)

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int, frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    W = len(row)
    lval = row[left] if left < W else frame_c
    rval = row[right] if right < W else frame_c
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    out_row = [lval] + content + [rval]
    while len(out_row) < 7:
        out_row.append(frame_c)
    return out_row[:7]
```
(Very helpful for per-row extraction; correctly frames content, limits to 5 inner cells, pads right with frame_c to 7, trims if needed; handles edge bounds.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly handled training examples 1 and 2, passing both by accurately detecting frames, sections, panels, and extracting with proper selection and padding.
 * Worked well for section detection and skipping empties; border row handling preserved structure.
 * choose_panel_index logic succeeded for training cases, suggesting it matches the panel selection rule (e.g., prioritizing later panels in early sections).
 * extract_panel_row functioned as intended, producing 7-column outputs with framed content.
 * Potential issue: For sections with >3 panels or unusual widths, the alternating logic (for section_idx >=3) might select incorrectly if the rule is stricter.
 * No major misses in training, but the program assumes fixed 7-column output and 5-max inner content, which worked for training but could clip wide panels.
 * get_border_positions is helpful and correct; filters valid panels properly.
 * Overall, core logic (frame detection, section looping, panel choice, row extraction) is solid and essential; no unhelpful functions here—all contributed.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 28 rows, structured as four repeated blocks: each block starts with a full frame row of [4]*7, followed by 6 rows of a patterned panel (8/1 content framed by 4's), then another full frame row.
 * Each panel pattern is identical across blocks: row1: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4]; row2: [4,8,1,1,8,1,4]; row3: [4,8,1,8,8,1,4]; row4: [4,8,1,1,1,1,4]; row5: [4,8,1,8,8,1,4]; row6: [4,8,8,8,8,8,4].
 * This suggests the test input has four similar sections, each with the same chosen panel extracted (likely the second or third panel if multiple per section, given the 1's and 8's pattern fitting a ~6-7 column panel).
 * The output makes sense structurally: it preserves borders as full frames, extracts consistent 7-column rows with padding (visible in uniform length and right-side 4's), and repeats for multiple sections, indicating the program detected and processed four sections correctly without skipping.
 * However, the perfect repetition across all four sections implies either the test input has identical panels/sections or the selection logic (e.g., always picking index 1 or 2) is too uniform— if the puzzle requires varying selections per section (e.g., different indices for later sections), this might be over-simplifying and not varying enough, though without the input grid, it's hard to confirm if the patterns should differ.
 * No obvious errors like mismatched lengths or ignored content; the 1's and 8's are preserved as non-frame, suggesting extraction sliced correctly between borders.
 * Subtle: If the test input has varying panel counts (e.g., some with 3 panels triggering middle selection), the output should show variation, but uniformity here might indicate all sections had the same num_panels and selected the same relative panel—plausible but worth verifying if the rule expects more diversity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured as multiple vertical sections separated by full horizontal border rows of a uniform frame color. The goal is to process the input grid and output a new grid where each section is reduced to a single selected panel (from multiple side-by-side panels within that section), rendered in a standardized 7-column format with left/right borders and 5 content columns, while preserving the separating border rows.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always the value at g[0][0] and defines all borders; entire rows of this color are treated as horizontal section dividers.
 * Sections are the blocks of non-border rows between these horizontal borders; the first non-border row of a section determines vertical border positions (columns equal to frame color, assumed to be consistent across the section's rows).
 * Panels within a section are the regions between consecutive vertical border positions; the number of panels is one less than the number of border positions.
 * Panel selection depends on the section's index (0 for the first content section, incrementing after each border): section 0 selects the third panel (index 2), section 1 selects the first (index 0), section 2 selects the second (index 1) if exactly 3 panels or the last otherwise; later sections may cycle or default based on code logic, but the provided code has a fallback to last panel if index exceeds.
 * Each selected panel's content is exactly 5 columns wide (starting immediately after the left border column), with the left border value taken from the panel's left border position and right from the right border position; the output row is always [left_border] + 5_content + [right_border].
 * If no panels (all-border grid), output a full-border grid of the same height and 7 columns.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all rows in a section have the same length and consistent border positions; content extraction skips the border columns entirely for the inner 5.
 * Easy to miss: Section indexing starts at 0 only after the initial top border(s); multiple consecutive border rows are treated as single dividers, but the code increments section_idx only when exiting content.
 * The input grid may have variable column width (wider for multiple panels), but output is fixed to 7 columns per row.
 * If num_panels < selected index, the code clamps to the last panel, which could be a bug if sections have varying panel counts.
 * Vertical borders are only detected from the first content row of a section, assuming uniformity; if not uniform, this could fail.
 * The puzzle likely involves 3 panels per section in training/test, given the selection logic favoring indices 0,1,2.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """Extracts the frame/border color from the top-left cell."""
    return g[0][0]
```

    frame_c = get_frame_color(g)
    r = 0
    H = len(g)
    while r < H and is_border_row(g[r], frame_c):
        r += 1
    if r == H:
        return []
    row = g[r]
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```

```python
def get_starts_and_rights(border_pos: List[int]) -> Tuple[List[int], List[int]]:
    """Derives left-start and right-end positions for each panel from border positions."""
    if len(border_pos) < 2:
        return [], []
    return border_pos[:-1], border_pos[1:]
```

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    """Selects panel index based on section position and total panels (assumes ~3 panels)."""
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating correct handling of frame detection, panel extraction, and selection logic for those cases (likely 3-panel sections with specific patterns).
 * The attempt correctly preserves horizontal borders as full 7-column frame-color rows in output.
 * Panel content extraction works as intended: left border + exactly 5 inner cells + right border, producing consistent 7-column rows.
 * Section indexing and incrementing after content blocks is handled properly, as evidenced by training success.
 * The choose_panel_index function captures a key subtlety of panel selection by position (e.g., third for first section, first for second), which is essential and not overgeneralized.
 * No unhelpful or broken functions noted; all provided (get_frame_color, is_border_row, get_border_positions, get_starts_and_rights, choose_panel_index) are relevant and functional for the core logic, though get_border_positions assumes section-local detection (recomputed per section in the main loop).
 * Potential minor issue: The fallback in main loop ("if panel_index >= num_panels: panel_index = num_panels - 1") and in choose_panel_index for later sections may not match puzzle rules if sections have varying panel counts or if selection should error/fail instead of clamping.
 * No omissions or mismatches noted in training, but unknown if training had varying section counts or identical panels.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 28-row grid (4 repeated 7-row blocks, with some shown as 8 rows including extra borders), each block consisting of top/bottom full rows of 4's (frame color), and 5 content rows forming a consistent pattern: borders of 4's/8's around 1's that outline a shape (possibly a letter 'A' or arrow-like in the 5x5 inner area, with 8's as secondary fill/border).
 * All 4 blocks are identical, suggesting the test input has 4 sections, each with at least 3 identical panels (or panels that render the same after selection: panel 2 for section 0, panel 0 for 1, etc., but yielding the same visual due to symmetry/duplication in input).
 * This makes sense and looks correct based on the logic: if the test input repeats the same multi-panel section 4 times (with frame color 4, secondary borders 8, content 1's in matching positions), the selection would produce identical outputs per section, stacked with borders intact; the fixed 7-column width and exact 5-cell content slice align with rules.
 * No obvious errors: patterns are symmetric and consistent (e.g., no mismatched lengths or colors leaking from unselected panels), and it demonstrates core principles like border preservation and panel isolation; however, without the raw test input or expected output, it's possible the repetition indicates over-selection of similar panels, but it doesn't appear broken (e.g., no all-4's fallback or truncated rows).

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 20:33:56] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors) structured like framed sections or comic panels, where the task is to detect frames, identify multi-panel sections, select a specific panel per section based on its index, and extract/resize those panels into a standardized 7-column output grid while preserving frames and padding appropriately.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The frame color is always taken from the top-left cell (g[0][0]), assuming it's consistent across the entire input grid; this works if frames are uniform but could fail if frames vary.
 * Border rows are full rows of the frame color, used to delineate sections; non-border rows within a section must be processed together to extract panels.
 * Panels within a section are delimited by columns containing the frame color (border positions); the number of panels is the count of gaps between these positions (len(border_pos) - 1).
 * Panel selection is rule-based on section index (starting from 0): section 0 selects the 3rd panel (index 2), section 1 selects the 1st (index 0), section 2 selects the 2nd (index 1) if 3 panels or the last otherwise, and later sections alternate or default to edges—this seems arbitrary and may encode a puzzle-specific pattern (e.g., cycling through panels to form a sequence).
 * Extraction per row: For the chosen panel, take the left/right frame values, extract up to 5 content cells between borders, pad the row to exactly 7 cells with frame color on the right if needed, and always bookend with frames; this resizes variable-width panels to a fixed 7-wide output.
 * Sections are processed sequentially, skipping empty or border-only areas; after a section, increment the section index.
 * Subtlety: If num_panels == 0 or <2 border positions, skip the section entirely without outputting anything.
 * Input grids can have variable width/height, multiple stacked sections separated by full border rows, and panels of varying widths; output is always 7-wide rows, with full frame rows (7 frame cells) inserted for section borders.
 * Easy to miss: Content extraction slices exactly [:5] after left+1 to right, ignoring any excess width beyond 5 cells, which assumes panels are not too wide or that overflow is discarded—could truncate important details.
 * Another subtlety: The while loop for processing rows in a section continues until a border row is hit, ensuring whole sections are captured, but the bottom border is handled by appending a frame row only if encountered.
 * Padding only happens on the right, and output is truncated to 7 if somehow longer (though the logic prevents it).
 * No handling for non-rectangular inputs or irregular borders; assumes clean, horizontal borders and vertical panel dividers.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_frame_color(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
This reliably identifies the uniform frame color from the top-left, essential for all border/panel detection.

```python
def is_border_row(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> bool:
    return all(x == frame_c for x in row)
```
Accurately detects full-frame rows that separate sections; critical for delineating content blocks.

```python
def get_border_positions(row: List[int], frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(len(row)) if row[j] == frame_c]
```
Finds vertical frame positions in a row to identify panel boundaries; used consistently across section rows (assumes alignment).

```python
def choose_panel_index(section_idx: int, num_panels: int) -> int:
    if section_idx == 0:
        return 2
    elif section_idx == 1:
        return 0
    elif section_idx == 2:
        return 1 if num_panels == 3 else num_panels - 1
    else:
        return 0 if section_idx % 2 == 1 else num_panels - 1
```
Encodes the panel selection logic, which is puzzle-specific and cycles selections (e.g., right/middle/left); bounds to valid range with min(..., num_panels-1). This is key but may need tuning if the pattern doesn't match all cases.

```python
def extract_panel_row(row: List[int], left: int, right: int, frame_c: int) -> List[int]:
    W = len(row)
    lval = row[left] if left < W else frame_c
    rval = row[right] if right < W else frame_c
    content = row[left + 1 : right][:5]
    out_row = [lval] + content + [rval]
    while len(out_row) < 7:
        out_row.append(frame_c)
    return out_row[:7]
```
Core extraction function: Grabs frame edges, limits content to 5 cells, pads right with frames to 7-wide. Handles edge cases like out-of-bounds positions gracefully.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed both training examples (1 and 2 marked CORRECT), indicating solid handling of basic section detection, panel extraction, and output formatting for those cases.
 * The program correctly skips non-panel rows/sections and inserts full frame rows for borders, which worked for training.
 * Panel selection logic via choose_panel_index allowed correct extraction in training, suggesting it captures a core rule for choosing which panel to output per section.
 * No prior failed attempts detailed, but the inclusion of num_panels calculation and border position finding prevented errors in empty sections.
 * The extraction logic with fixed 5-content cells and right-padding worked without truncation issues in training.
 * Overall, the modular functions (e.g., is_border_row, extract_panel_row) are helpful and should be retained; no unhelpful or broken functions identified in this attempt.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of four identical 9-row blocks (top frame row, 6 content rows, bottom frame row), each showing a consistent pattern: full frame rows are [4]*7, content starts/ends with 4,8,...8,4, and inner rows have 8's as fillers with 1's forming a shape (e.g., row2: 8,1,1,8,1; row3: 8,1,8,8,1; etc.), resembling a repeated symbol or figure like an "E" or abstract shape in a 5-wide content area.
 * This repetition suggests the test input likely contains four stacked sections with identical multi-panel layouts (probably 3 panels, given the choose logic selecting index 2,0,1, then alternating for section 3), and the program extracted the same panel from each due to identical content— the output makes sense structurally as it maintains frames, consistent 7-wide rows, and section separation.
 * However, the exact repetition (same 1's pattern in every section) might indicate the test input has uniform sections, so the output appears correct and consistent with the program's logic; no obvious mismatches like missing frames or wrong widths.
 * If the expected output should vary (e.g., different panels selected to form a sequence across sections), this uniform extraction could be incorrect, but without the expected output, it looks logically sound and matches the puzzle's extraction rules—no truncation visible, padding correct (e.g., content + rval + frames to 7).
 * The pattern of 1's is preserved identically, which is expected if extracting the same relative panel each time; no evidence of errors like skipping sections or misaligned borders.
