=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:04:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-09-30 19:12:09] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def is_block_row(row: List[int]) -> bool:
    if len(row) != 24 or row[0] != row[23]:
        return False
    return row[0] != row[1]

def fill_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    if len(g) == 0 or len(g[0]) == 0:
        return g
    bg = g[0][0]
    for row in g:
        non_bg_count = 0
        for c in row:
            if c != bg:
                non_bg_count += 1
        if non_bg_count < 10:
            for j in range(len(row)):
                row[j] = bg
    return g

def apply_h_pattern(g: List[List[int]], start: int, end: int, border_c: int, interior_c: int) -> None:
    height = end - start + 1
    k = min(3, height)
    for j in range(k):
        r = end - j
        row = g[r]
        for c in range(1, 23):
            row[c] = interior_c
        pattern_r = 2 - j
        if pattern_r == 0 or pattern_r == 2:
            for c in range(7, 13):
                row[c] = border_c
        elif pattern_r == 1:
            row[7] = border_c
            row[12] = border_c

def modify_blocks(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    i = 0
    n_rows = len(g)
    while i < n_rows:
        if not is_block_row(g[i]):
            i += 1
            continue
        border_c = g[i][0]
        interior_c = g[i][1]
        start = i
        i += 1
        while i < n_rows and g[i][0] == border_c and g[i][23] == border_c and g[i][1] == interior_c:
            i += 1
        end = i - 1
        apply_h_pattern(g, start, end, border_c, interior_c)
    return g

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = fill_background(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 19:14:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 24xN grid (columns 0 and 23 often serve as borders) where the goal is to detect and modify rectangular "block" regions—defined by consistent left/right border colors and uniform interior colors—while preserving or filling background areas. Modifications involve leaving the top portion of each block unchanged (plain border/interior) and applying a specific patterned overlay (often to the bottom 3 rows) that resembles letter-like or symbolic shapes using the border color, but the exact pattern varies by block (e.g., based on colors, height, or position), and small/sparse regions may need to be treated as background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks are vertical stacks of rows where each row has matching left (col 0) and right (col 23) border colors, differing from the uniform interior color (cols 1-22); detection must scan consecutively without gaps, and blocks are separated by background rows (often all one color like 1 or 8).
 * Background filling applies to rows with few (<10 in this attempt) non-background cells, using the grid's top-left color as bg, but this is row-wise only and misses vertical context—subtle issue: small-height blocks (e.g., height 3) with border matching bg color should likely be fully filled as background to blend in, rather than patterned, as seen in train2 where a small 8/2 block was patterned but expected to be uniform 8.
 * Pattern application targets the bottom min(3, height) rows of each block, filling cols 1-22 with interior color and overlaying border color in specific positions to form shapes; however, the shape is not always an "H"—it's context-dependent (e.g., symmetric H-like for some like 4/3 in train1, asymmetric vertical/horizontal bars for 5/2 in train1, more fragmented for 1/3 in train3, or extended 4-row patterns for taller blocks in train2).
 * Subtleties: Patterns must preserve borders (cols 0/23 always border color); interiors are uniform except for pattern overlays; height affects pattern (taller blocks have more plain top rows, e.g., 7-height block has 4 plain + 3 pattern); background rows (e.g., all 1's) remain untouched; potential asymmetry in patterns (e.g., left-heavy in train1's 5/2 block with vertical bars cols 2-4/8-11); easy to miss that patterns may not span full width symmetrically and could mimic letters (e.g., "E"-like with left vertical and right/bottom horizontals); small blocks (<4 height?) may not get patterns at all; no modification to non-block areas; grid height varies but always 24 cols.
 * Across attempts (this is the only provided): Fill background before modifying to clean sparse areas, but threshold <10 non-bg may be too low (blocks have ~22 non-bg); block detection works for large uniform interiors but fails if input has pre-patterned or irregular interiors; patterns must be customizable (current fixed H misses variations); consider block position (e.g., middle blocks in train2/3 have unique patterns); no horizontal patterns or full-grid effects observed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `is_block_row` function is helpful for initial row detection (checks len=24, col0==col23 != col1), but could be extended to validate full interior uniformity (currently assumes after detection).

The `fill_background` function is partially helpful for cleaning sparse rows (deepcopy preserves original; bg from [0][0]; counts non-bg per row), but broken for block contexts—should consider block height/vertical sparsity instead of per-row <10 threshold, as it doesn't catch small blocks blending with bg (e.g., border=bg in train2).

The `apply_h_pattern` function is helpful as a template for bottom-row overlays (takes start/end, border_c, interior_c; k=min(3,height); fills cols 1-22 interior; overlays border in positions like 7-12 for horizontals and 7/12 for verticals), but not general—it's fixed to one "H" shape (bottom/top horizontals cols7-12 border, middle verticals col7/12 border), which works for symmetric cases (e.g., train1 4/3 block) but fails for asymmetric/fragmented ones; modify to parameterize positions per block type.

The `modify_blocks` function is helpful for scanning and grouping consecutive block rows (while loop finds start/end; applies pattern), but assumes all blocks use same pattern and doesn't handle small blocks (e.g., height<4 should skip pattern/fill bg).

No types defined (e.g., no Block class with border/interior/height/start_row), but could add for clarity.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_background` is not fully relevant without vertical block awareness (don't rely on <10 threshold alone; it ignores height-matched border=bg cases like train2's small 8/2 block, which gets patterned instead of filled).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly detects large blocks (e.g., height 7 for 4/3 in train1, applies pattern to exact bottom 3 rows, matching expected plain top + H bottom; similar for top blocks in train3).
 * Missed variable patterns: Fixed H works for train1's first block (generated matches expected rows14-16: horizontals cols7-12 border=4, verticals col7/12) but fails for train1's second block (generated H on rows21-23 with border=5: cols1-22=2 except 7-12=5 bottom/top, col7/12=5 middle; expected instead has left vertical bars cols2-4/8-11=5 in rows21/23, gaps in row22 cols2/4=5, right horizontal only bottom row23 cols8-11=5—more "E"-like/asymmetric; difference: generated symmetric center, expected left-heavy with right extension only bottom).
 * Missed for train1's third block (generated H on rows26-28? with border=3: similar center overlay; expected rows27-28 fragmented right-side: row27 cols1-16=8,17-18=3,19-22=8; row28 cols1-2=8,3=3,4-16=8,17-18=3,19-22=8—difference: generated center H, expected right-side breaks at cols17-18/3 with border=3 intrusions, like a backward "C" or notch; row26 plain in both, but height detection may have off-by-one, leading to extra pattern row).
 * For train2, block detection over-applies to small early block (generated detects height-3 8/2 at rows2-4, applies H: row2 bottom cols1-22=2 except7-12=8, etc.; expected all plain 8's for top13 rows—difference: generated introduces interior 2's and pattern where expected uniform bg=8; likely input has small block but should be filled as bg since border=bg=8 and small height; fill_background fails as non_bg=22>10).
 * For train2 middle block (4/2, height~7 rows14-20), generated applies standard H to bottom3 (rows18-20: center overlays), but expected applies extended 4-row pattern rows17-20 (row17 right-heavy horizontals cols8-14=4; rows18-20 mixed left/right verticals/gaps cols1-5/15-22 with horizontals—difference: generated 3-row center H, expected 4-row asymmetric with more left fills in row18 and repeated verticals in 19-20; unknown why 4 rows vs 3, perhaps height>6 triggers extra).
 * For train2 bottom block (6/4? wait 6 border 4 interior, height5 rows22-26), generated applies H to bottom3 (rows24-26 center), expected 3-row pattern but fragmented (row24 plain? lists show row24 H-like but expected row24 cols8-11=6? wait, expected row24:6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,6,6,4,4... difference: generated standard H, expected gaps at cols9-12/14 with verticals cols9/14=6 in middle rows—more dotted verticals).
 * For train3 middle block (1/3, height~8? rows16-23), generated applies H to bottom3 (rows21-23 center cols7-12=1 overlays on 3), expected 3-row but fragmented left (row21 cols7-9=1 gap then 10-22=3? wait list: row21 cols7-9=1,10-22=3? actually cols8-10=1? precise: row21 has gaps cols3-5? wait list shows cols3-5=3? difference: generated symmetric center H, expected left-focused with gaps cols3-4=1 in row22/23, vertical at col6=3? in row21, more like "F" or broken vertical—specific mismatch at cols1-6/20-22).
 * For train3 bottom block (6/8, height5 rows22-26? but lists overlap), generated H bottom3, expected 3-row with right extensions (row24 cols13-18=6 gaps, row25 cols2=6,4-5=6? etc.—difference: generated center, expected right-shifted with multiple gaps).
 * extract_objects not present, but block grouping in modify_blocks is essential for handling start/end correctly (worked for plain tops).
 * Train1 first block perfect match (plain top4 + H bottom3), but others mismatch pattern/shape.
 * Train2 mismatches blob (block) start/end (early small block patterned instead of filled; middle pattern row count/shape wrong for unknown reason—perhaps patterns scale with height or color pair).
 * Train3 top uniform correct (no change), but patterns wrong (asymmetric vs symmetric H).
 * Function `apply_h_pattern` is partially helpful but broken for non-H cases (don't use fixed version; generalize to pattern dict by color or height).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it uniformly applies the same center-symmetric H pattern to bottom 3 rows of all detected blocks (e.g., rows15-17 for 3/1 block: standard H overlays; rows20-22 for 1/2 block: H; rows25-27 for 4/3 block: H), but based on training examples, patterns should vary (e.g., asymmetric left/right bars, gaps, or extended rows depending on colors like 3/1 or 1/2 needing fragmented verticals, not center H; 4/3 might be H but others not).
 * Specifically, the 3/1 block (rows13-16? plain top2 + H bottom3) likely needs left-heavy pattern like train3's 1/3 (gaps cols3-4, vertical col6), but generated has center cols7-12/7&12—mismatch in positions (center vs left).
 * The 1/2 block (row19 plain + rows20-22 H, height4?) likely needs asymmetric like train1's 5/2 (left verticals cols2-4=1 on 2, right bottom horizontal cols8-11=1), but generated center H—mismatch, plus height4 may need only bottom2 or different scale.
 * The 4/3 block (row24 plain +25-27 H) might match a simple H like train1, but if test follows variations, could need adjustment; overall, ignores potential small-block filling (e.g., if 1/2 is small, should be bg=8 filled, not patterned).
 * Top/middle/bottom 8's uniform correct (bg untouched), but block modifications introduce wrong shapes, making output inconsistent with training's diverse patterns; to handle test, need pattern selector (e.g., by interior color: 3->H, 2->asymmetric E, 1->fragmented F?) and small-block fill logic (height<4 and border==bg -> fill all rows bg).

 * Background filling applies to rows with few (<10 in this attempt) non-background cells, using the grid's top-left color as bg, but this is row-wise only and misses vertical context—subtle issue: small-height blocks (e.g., height 3) with border matching bg color should likely be fully filled as background to blend in, rather than patterned, as seen in train2 where a small 8/2 block was patterned but expected to be uniform 8.
 * Pattern application targets the bottom min(3, height) rows of each block, filling cols 1-22 with interior color and overlaying border color in specific positions to form shapes; however, the shape is not always an "H"—it's context-dependent (e.g., symmetric H-like for some like 4/3 in train1, asymmetric vertical/horizontal bars for 5/2 in train1, more fragmented for 1/3 in train3, or extended 4-row patterns for taller blocks in train2).
 * Subtleties: Patterns must preserve borders (cols 0/23 always border color); interiors are uniform except for pattern overlays; height affects pattern (taller blocks have more plain top rows, e.g., 7-height block has 4 plain + 3 pattern); background rows (e.g., all 1's) remain untouched; potential asymmetry in patterns (e.g., left-heavy in train1's 5/2 block with vertical bars cols 2-4/8-11); easy to miss that patterns may not span full width symmetrically and could mimic letters (e.g., "E"-like with left vertical and right/bottom horizontals); small blocks (<4 height?) may not get patterns at all; no modification to non-block areas; grid height varies but always 24 cols.
 * Across attempts (this is the only provided): Fill background before modifying to clean sparse areas, but threshold <10 non-bg may be too low (blocks have ~22 non-bg); block detection works for large uniform interiors but fails if input has pre-patterned or irregular interiors; patterns must be customizable (current fixed H misses variations); consider block position (e.g., middle blocks in train2/3 have unique patterns); no horizontal patterns or full-grid effects observed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `is_block_row` function is helpful for initial row detection (checks len=24, col0==col23 != col1), but could be extended to validate full interior uniformity (currently assumes after detection).

The `fill_background` function is partially helpful for cleaning sparse rows (deepcopy preserves original; bg from [0][0]; counts non-bg per row), but broken for block contexts—should consider block height/vertical sparsity instead of per-row <10 threshold, as it doesn't catch small blocks blending with bg (e.g., border=bg in train2).

The `apply_h_pattern` function is helpful as a template for bottom-row overlays (takes start/end, border_c, interior_c; k=min(3,height); fills cols 1-22 interior; overlays border in positions like 7-12 for horizontals and 7/12 for verticals), but not general—it's fixed to one "H" shape (bottom/top horizontals cols7-12 border, middle verticals col7/12 border), which works for symmetric cases (e.g., train1 4/3 block) but fails for asymmetric/fragmented ones; modify to parameterize positions per block type.

The `modify_blocks` function is helpful for scanning and grouping consecutive block rows (while loop finds start/end; applies pattern), but assumes all blocks use same pattern and doesn't handle small blocks (e.g., height<4 should skip pattern/fill bg).

No types defined (e.g., no Block class with border/interior/height/start_row), but could add for clarity.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_background` is not fully relevant without vertical block awareness (don't rely on <10 threshold alone; it ignores height-matched border=bg cases like train2's small 8/2 block, which gets patterned instead of filled).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly detects large blocks (e.g., height 7 for 4/3 in train1, applies pattern to exact bottom 3 rows, matching expected plain top + H bottom; similar for top blocks in train3).
 * Missed variable patterns: Fixed H works for train1's first block (generated matches expected rows14-16: horizontals cols7-12 border=4, verticals col7/12) but fails for train1's second block (generated H on rows21-23 with border=5: cols1-22=2 except 7-12=5 bottom/top, col7/12=5 middle; expected instead has left vertical bars cols2-4/8-11=5 in rows21/23, gaps in row22 cols2/4=5, right horizontal only bottom row23 cols8-11=5—more "E"-like/asymmetric; difference: generated symmetric center, expected left-heavy with right extension only bottom).
 * Missed for train1's third block (generated H on rows26-28? with border=3: similar center overlay; expected rows27-28 fragmented right-side: row27 cols1-16=8,17-18=3,19-22=8; row28 cols1-2=8,3=3,4-16=8,17-18=3,19-22=8—difference: generated center H, expected right-side breaks at cols17-18/3 with border=3 intrusions, like a backward "C" or notch; row26 plain in both, but height detection may have off-by-one, leading to extra pattern row).
 * For train2, block detection over-applies to small early block (generated detects height-3 8/2 at rows2-4, applies H: row2 bottom cols1-22=2 except7-12=8, etc.; expected all plain 8's for top13 rows—difference: generated introduces interior 2's and pattern where expected uniform bg=8; likely input has small block but should be filled as bg since border=bg=8 and small height; fill_background fails as non_bg=22>10).
 * For train2 middle block (4/2, height~7 rows14-20), generated applies standard H to bottom3 (rows18-20: center overlays), but expected applies extended 4-row pattern rows17-20 (row17 right-heavy horizontals cols8-14=4; rows18-20 mixed left/right verticals/gaps cols1-5/15-22 with horizontals—difference: generated 3-row center H, expected 4-row asymmetric with more left fills in row18 and repeated verticals in 19-20; unknown why 4 rows vs 3, perhaps height>6 triggers extra).
 * For train2 bottom block (6/4? wait 6 border 4 interior, height5 rows22-26), generated applies H to bottom3 (rows24-26 center), expected 3-row pattern but fragmented (row24 plain? lists show row24 H-like but expected row24 cols8-11=6? wait, expected row24:6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,6,6,4,4... difference: generated standard H, expected gaps at cols9-12/14 with verticals cols9/14=6 in middle rows—more dotted verticals).
 * For train3 middle block (1/3, height~8? rows16-23), generated applies H to bottom3 (rows21-23 center cols7-12=1 overlays on 3), expected 3-row but fragmented left (row21 cols7-9=1 gap then 10-22=3? wait list: row21 cols7-9=1,10-22=3? actually cols8-10=1? precise: row21 has gaps cols3-5? wait list shows cols3-5=3? difference: generated symmetric center H, expected left-focused with gaps cols3-4=1 in row22/23, vertical at col6=3? in row21, more like "F" or broken vertical—specific mismatch at cols1-6/20-22).
 * For train3 bottom block (6/8, height5 rows22-26? but lists overlap), generated H bottom3, expected 3-row with right extensions (row24 cols13-18=6 gaps, row25 cols2=6,4-5=6? etc.—difference: generated center, expected right-shifted with multiple gaps).
 * extract_objects not present, but block grouping in modify_blocks is essential for handling start/end correctly (worked for plain tops).
 * Train1 first block perfect match (plain top4 + H bottom3), but others mismatch pattern/shape.
 * Train2 mismatches blob (block) start/end (early small block patterned instead of filled; middle pattern row count/shape wrong for unknown reason—perhaps patterns scale with height or color pair).
 * Train3 top uniform correct (no change), but patterns wrong (asymmetric vs symmetric H).
 * Function `apply_h_pattern` is partially helpful but broken for non-H cases (don't use fixed version; generalize to pattern dict by color or height).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it uniformly applies the same center-symmetric H pattern to bottom 3 rows of all detected blocks (e.g., rows15-17 for 3/1 block: standard H overlays; rows20-22 for 1/2 block: H; rows25-27 for 4/3 block: H), but based on training examples, patterns should vary (e.g., asymmetric left/right bars, gaps, or extended rows depending on colors like 3/1 or 1/2 needing fragmented verticals, not center H; 4/3 might be H but others not).
 * Specifically, the 3/1 block (rows13-16? plain top2 + H bottom3) likely needs left-heavy pattern like train3's 1/3 (gaps cols3-4, vertical col6), but generated has center cols7-12/7&12—mismatch in positions (center vs left).
 * The 1/2 block (row19 plain + rows20-22 H, height4?) likely needs asymmetric like train1's 5/2 (left verticals cols2-4=1 on 2, right bottom horizontal cols8-11=1), but generated center H—mismatch, plus height4 may need only bottom2 or different scale.
 * The 4/3 block (row24 plain +25-27 H) might match a simple H like train1, but if test follows variations, could need adjustment; overall, ignores potential small-block filling (e.g., if 1/2 is small, should be bg=8 filled, not patterned).
 * Top/middle/bottom 8's uniform correct (bg untouched), but block modifications introduce wrong shapes, making output inconsistent with training's diverse patterns; to handle test, need pattern selector (e.g., by interior color: 3->H, 2->asymmetric E, 1->fragmented F?) and small-block fill logic (height<4 and border==bg -> fill all rows bg).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 19:21:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers 1-8) where the task is to detect large uniform "blocks" (rectangular regions with consistent border and interior colors) and replace their interior patterns with specific stylized templates (often H-shaped or similar motifs) while preserving the background and non-block areas; the output grid maintains the same dimensions (typically 24 columns wide, variable height) and only modifies qualifying blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be at least 4 rows high to qualify for patterning; shorter uniform areas remain unchanged or filled with background.
 * A valid block starts with matching left/right border colors (non-background), uniform interior (22 cells, single color different from border), and the same structure persists vertically until broken.
 * Background color is detected from the top-left cell and used to initialize/fill non-block areas; it can vary per example (e.g., 1 in training 1, 8 in training 2, 4 in training 3).
 * Patterns are keyed by (border_color, interior_color) tuples, with known templates for specific pairs like (4,3), (5,2), (3,8), (4,2), (6,4), (1,3), (6,8); for unknown pairs (e.g., (3,1) in test), the code attempts to swap/adapt from known similar pairs like (1,3) or defaults to a generic H-pattern, but this often fails to match expected outputs.
 * Patterns apply only to the bottom 3 rows of a block (num_p=3), with plain uniform rows above; borders are always preserved/reapplied as [border] + pattern + [border].
 * Subtle: Patterns must exactly match expected motifs (e.g., for (4,3), expected has a central horizontal bar of 4's split by interiors in rows 14-16, but generated often shifts or simplifies them); vertical alignment and exact positions matter, and blocks don't overlap or span the full width if interiors vary.
 * Grids may have multiple blocks separated by background or thin lines; small/mixed areas (e.g., 1-3 row uniforms) stay as background.
 * Easy to miss: Interior must be strictly uniform and != border; scanning is top-down and skips non-potential starts; for swapped colors (e.g., (3,1) vs (1,3)), adaptation inverts colors in the template but may not preserve the exact motif shape.
 * Non-block rows (e.g., pure background like rows of 1's or 8's) remain unchanged.
 * Grid width is fixed at 24, with patterns designed for 22 interior cells; partial blocks or irregular shapes aren't handled—only full-width uniforms qualify.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/train test, 4 in train3) and initializes output properly, leaving pure background rows unchanged (e.g., top/bottom rows of 1's/8's/4's match expected).
 * Successfully identifies and measures block heights (e.g., (4,3) block rows 10-16 in train1, height=7; (5,2) rows 18-23, height=6; similar for others), and applies borders correctly in outputs.
 * For known patterns like (5,2) in train1 and (6,4) in train2, the motif positions are partially correct (e.g., central bars and legs appear), showing adaptation logic has potential.
 * However, all training examples failed: In train1, (4,3) block has incorrect pattern in rows 14-16—generated has uniform 3's with misplaced 4's (e.g., row15: 3's then single 4 then more 3's, but expected has clustered 4's at cols 7-12 and 17-? wait, actually expected row15 has 4 at col8 only? No—expected row14/16: 3's with 4's at 7-12; row15: 3's with 4 at 8 and 14; generated mismatches by having row14/16 identical but row15 with 4's at wrong spots (e.g., 4's at 7-13? Listing shows generated row15: [4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4] vs expected [4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4]—positions of 4's shifted right by 1 in middle).
 * Train1 (3,8) block rows 27-30: generated has uniform 8's in row27 (wrong, expected has 8's with 3's at start/end), and rows28-30 mismatch—generated row28: [3,8*21,3,3,8*4] but expected row28: [3,8,8,8*13,3,3,8*4] wait no, from listing: generated row27 all 8's (fail), row28/29 have early 3's misplaced; expected has varying 3 positions (e.g., row30: 3,8,8,3 +8's +3,3+8's).
 * Train2: (4,2) block rows13-19 height=7, generated patterns close but row16/17 identical and wrong—expected row16/17 have 4's at start then 2's with specific 4 insertions (e.g., expected row16: [4,4,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] vs generated same but starts with [4,2*6,4*? no—generated row16: [4,4,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] wait, actually matches expected for row16/17 in listing? Wait, train2 generated row16: [4,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] no, listing shows generated row15 all 2's interior (plain), row18 has 4's misplaced; overall mismatches in vertical legs (e.g., expected row17/18 identical with more 4's at end).
 * Train3: (1,3) block rows16-23 height=8, but generated uses plain 3's for most (only bottom 3 patterned wrong—e.g., row20: [1,3*21,1] plain vs expected patterned; row21: generated [1,3,3,3* ,1,1,3*] but expected [1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1] with 1's at 7-8; adaptation from (1,3) to itself? But positions off. (6,8) block rows24-28: generated row26 all 8's (plain wrong), row27/28 have 6's misplaced (e.g., generated [6,8*12,6*6,8*3] vs expected clustered 6's at end).
 * get_pattern_for_block adaptation is broken for unknowns (e.g., inverts colors but doesn't adjust motif for new border/interior roles, leading to swapped but shape-mismatched outputs).
 * scan_and_apply_blocks skips small blocks correctly but overwrites only if h>=4, yet in train3 top 16 rows are all 4's (background?) but generated correctly as 4's; however, (1,3) detection starts at row16 but patterns apply wrong.
 * No extraction of arbitrary objects—code assumes full-width blocks only; unhelpful for partial or non-uniform shapes.
 * initialize_output_to_background is helpful and correct; is_potential_block_start is mostly accurate but too rigid (assumes exact 22 uniform).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it mostly fills with background 8's (correct for top/bottom), but mishandles blocks: (3,1) block (rows14-18?) has patterns that appear swapped from (1,3)—e.g., row16: [3,1*6,3*3,1* ,3* ] with 3's as "interior" motifs but positions don't form expected H (expected likely inverts (1,3) properly with 1's as borders and 3's patterned, but generated has irregular 3's in row17/18 like [3,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1*10,3] which seems over-patterned/misplaced). (1,2) block rows25-28: generated has [1,2,1,1,1,2*16,1] etc., attempting adaptation from (5,2) but colors swapped wrong (2's as border? No—key=(1,2), adapts to have 1's as interior motifs but shapes don't match expected zigzag or H for (1,2); looks like partial plain with misplaced 1's/2's, e.g., row27 has extra 1's interrupting 2's). (4,3) block rows29-32: applies known (4,3) but only bottom 3 rows patterned, top plain—generated row29 all 3's interior (correct plain), but row30/31/32 have 4's shifted (similar to train1 error, e.g., row31: 4's at wrong cols like 7-? vs expected clustered). Overall, test output preserves structure but pattern positions/colors are off by 1-2 cols or inverted incorrectly, leaving non-block rows (e.g., row19 all 8's, row24 all 8's) correct but blocks visually distorted—not matching a coherent puzzle solution.

[2025-09-30 19:21:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 24xN grid (columns 0 and 23 often serve as borders) where the goal is to detect and modify rectangular "block" regions—defined by consistent left/right border colors and uniform interior colors—while preserving or filling background areas. Modifications involve leaving the top portion of each block unchanged (plain border/interior) and applying a specific patterned overlay (often to the bottom 3 rows) that resembles letter-like or symbolic shapes using the border color, but the exact pattern varies by block (e.g., based on colors, height, or position), and small/sparse regions may need to be treated as background.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks are vertical stacks of rows where each row has matching left (col 0) and right (col 23) border colors, differing from the uniform interior color (cols 1-22); detection must scan consecutively without gaps, and blocks are separated by background rows (often all one color like 1 or 8).
 * Background filling applies to rows with few (<10 in this attempt) non-background cells, using the grid's top-left color as bg, but this is row-wise only and misses vertical context—subtle issue: small-height blocks (e.g., height 3) with border matching bg color should likely be fully filled as background to blend in, rather than patterned, as seen in train2 where a small 8/2 block was patterned but expected to be uniform 8.
 * Pattern application targets the bottom min(3, height) rows of each block, filling cols 1-22 with interior color and overlaying border color in specific positions to form shapes; however, the shape is not always an "H"—it's context-dependent (e.g., symmetric H-like for some like 4/3 in train1, asymmetric vertical/horizontal bars for 5/2 in train1, more fragmented for 1/3 in train3, or extended 4-row patterns for taller blocks in train2).
 * Subtleties: Patterns must preserve borders (cols 0/23 always border color); interiors are uniform except for pattern overlays; height affects pattern (taller blocks have more plain top rows, e.g., 7-height block has 4 plain + 3 pattern); background rows (e.g., all 1's) remain untouched; potential asymmetry in patterns (e.g., left-heavy in train1's 5/2 block with vertical bars cols 2-4/8-11); easy to miss that patterns may not span full width symmetrically and could mimic letters (e.g., "E"-like with left vertical and right/bottom horizontals); small blocks (<4 height?) may not get patterns at all; no modification to non-block areas; grid height varies but always 24 cols.
 * Across attempts (this is the only provided): Fill background before modifying to clean sparse areas, but threshold <10 non-bg may be too low (blocks have ~22 non-bg); block detection works for large uniform interiors but fails if input has pre-patterned or irregular interiors; patterns must be customizable (current fixed H misses variations); consider block position (e.g., middle blocks in train2/3 have unique patterns); no horizontal patterns or full-grid effects observed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The `is_block_row` function is helpful for initial row detection (checks len=24, col0==col23 != col1), but could be extended to validate full interior uniformity (currently assumes after detection).

The `fill_background` function is partially helpful for cleaning sparse rows (deepcopy preserves original; bg from [0][0]; counts non-bg per row), but broken for block contexts—should consider block height/vertical sparsity instead of per-row <10 threshold, as it doesn't catch small blocks blending with bg (e.g., border=bg in train2).

The `apply_h_pattern` function is helpful as a template for bottom-row overlays (takes start/end, border_c, interior_c; k=min(3,height); fills cols 1-22 interior; overlays border in positions like 7-12 for horizontals and 7/12 for verticals), but not general—it's fixed to one "H" shape (bottom/top horizontals cols7-12 border, middle verticals col7/12 border), which works for symmetric cases (e.g., train1 4/3 block) but fails for asymmetric/fragmented ones; modify to parameterize positions per block type.

The `modify_blocks` function is helpful for scanning and grouping consecutive block rows (while loop finds start/end; applies pattern), but assumes all blocks use same pattern and doesn't handle small blocks (e.g., height<4 should skip pattern/fill bg).

No types defined (e.g., no Block class with border/interior/height/start_row), but could add for clarity.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_background` is not fully relevant without vertical block awareness (don't rely on <10 threshold alone; it ignores height-matched border=bg cases like train2's small 8/2 block, which gets patterned instead of filled).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one provided) correctly detects large blocks (e.g., height 7 for 4/3 in train1, applies pattern to exact bottom 3 rows, matching expected plain top + H bottom; similar for top blocks in train3).
 * Missed variable patterns: Fixed H works for train1's first block (generated matches expected rows14-16: horizontals cols7-12 border=4, verticals col7/12) but fails for train1's second block (generated H on rows21-23 with border=5: cols1-22=2 except 7-12=5 bottom/top, col7/12=5 middle; expected instead has left vertical bars cols2-4/8-11=5 in rows21/23, gaps in row22 cols2/4=5, right horizontal only bottom row23 cols8-11=5—more "E"-like/asymmetric; difference: generated symmetric center, expected left-heavy with right extension only bottom).
 * Missed for train1's third block (generated H on rows26-28? with border=3: similar center overlay; expected rows27-28 fragmented right-side: row27 cols1-16=8,17-18=3,19-22=8; row28 cols1-2=8,3=3,4-16=8,17-18=3,19-22=8—difference: generated center H, expected right-side breaks at cols17-18/3 with border=3 intrusions, like a backward "C" or notch; row26 plain in both, but height detection may have off-by-one, leading to extra pattern row).
 * For train2, block detection over-applies to small early block (generated detects height-3 8/2 at rows2-4, applies H: row2 bottom cols1-22=2 except7-12=8, etc.; expected all plain 8's for top13 rows—difference: generated introduces interior 2's and pattern where expected uniform bg=8; likely input has small block but should be filled as bg since border=bg=8 and small height; fill_background fails as non_bg=22>10).
 * For train2 middle block (4/2, height~7 rows14-20), generated applies standard H to bottom3 (rows18-20: center overlays), but expected applies extended 4-row pattern rows17-20 (row17 right-heavy horizontals cols8-14=4; rows18-20 mixed left/right verticals/gaps cols1-5/15-22 with horizontals—difference: generated 3-row center H, expected 4-row asymmetric with more left fills in row18 and repeated verticals in 19-20; unknown why 4 rows vs 3, perhaps height>6 triggers extra).
 * For train2 bottom block (6/4? wait 6 border 4 interior, height5 rows22-26), generated applies H to bottom3 (rows24-26 center), expected 3-row pattern but fragmented (row24 plain? lists show row24 H-like but expected row24 cols8-11=6? wait, expected row24:6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,6,6,4,4... difference: generated standard H, expected gaps at cols9-12/14 with verticals cols9/14=6 in middle rows—more dotted verticals).
 * For train3 middle block (1/3, height~8? rows16-23), generated applies H to bottom3 (rows21-23 center cols7-12=1 overlays on 3), expected 3-row but fragmented left (row21 cols7-9=1 gap then 10-22=3? wait list: row21 cols7-9=1,10-22=3? actually cols8-10=1? precise: row21 has gaps cols3-5? wait list shows cols3-5=3? difference: generated symmetric center H, expected left-focused with gaps cols3-4=1 in row22/23, vertical at col6=3? in row21, more like "F" or broken vertical—specific mismatch at cols1-6/20-22).
 * For train3 bottom block (6/8, height5 rows22-26? but lists overlap), generated H bottom3, expected 3-row with right extensions (row24 cols13-18=6 gaps, row25 cols2=6,4-5=6? etc.—difference: generated center, expected right-shifted with multiple gaps).
 * extract_objects not present, but block grouping in modify_blocks is essential for handling start/end correctly (worked for plain tops).
 * Train1 first block perfect match (plain top4 + H bottom3), but others mismatch pattern/shape.
 * Train2 mismatches blob (block) start/end (early small block patterned instead of filled; middle pattern row count/shape wrong for unknown reason—perhaps patterns scale with height or color pair).
 * Train3 top uniform correct (no change), but patterns wrong (asymmetric vs symmetric H).
 * Function `apply_h_pattern` is partially helpful but broken for non-H cases (don't use fixed version; generalize to pattern dict by color or height).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it uniformly applies the same center-symmetric H pattern to bottom 3 rows of all detected blocks (e.g., rows15-17 for 3/1 block: standard H overlays; rows20-22 for 1/2 block: H; rows25-27 for 4/3 block: H), but based on training examples, patterns should vary (e.g., asymmetric left/right bars, gaps, or extended rows depending on colors like 3/1 or 1/2 needing fragmented verticals, not center H; 4/3 might be H but others not).
 * Specifically, the 3/1 block (rows13-16? plain top2 + H bottom3) likely needs left-heavy pattern like train3's 1/3 (gaps cols3-4, vertical col6), but generated has center cols7-12/7&12—mismatch in positions (center vs left).
 * The 1/2 block (row19 plain + rows20-22 H, height4?) likely needs asymmetric like train1's 5/2 (left verticals cols2-4=1 on 2, right bottom horizontal cols8-11=1), but generated center H—mismatch, plus height4 may need only bottom2 or different scale.
 * The 4/3 block (row24 plain +25-27 H) might match a simple H like train1, but if test follows variations, could need adjustment; overall, ignores potential small-block filling (e.g., if 1/2 is small, should be bg=8 filled, not patterned).
 * Top/middle/bottom 8's uniform correct (bg untouched), but block modifications introduce wrong shapes, making output inconsistent with training's diverse patterns; to handle test, need pattern selector (e.g., by interior color: 3->H, 2->asymmetric E, 1->fragmented F?) and small-block fill logic (height<4 and border==bg -> fill all rows bg).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers 1-8) where the task is to detect large uniform "blocks" (rectangular regions with consistent border and interior colors) and replace their interior patterns with specific stylized templates (often H-shaped or similar motifs) while preserving the background and non-block areas; the output grid maintains the same dimensions (typically 24 columns wide, variable height) and only modifies qualifying blocks.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blocks must be at least 4 rows high to qualify for patterning; shorter uniform areas remain unchanged or filled with background.
 * A valid block starts with matching left/right border colors (non-background), uniform interior (22 cells, single color different from border), and the same structure persists vertically until broken.
 * Background color is detected from the top-left cell and used to initialize/fill non-block areas; it can vary per example (e.g., 1 in training 1, 8 in training 2, 4 in training 3).
 * Patterns are keyed by (border_color, interior_color) tuples, with known templates for specific pairs like (4,3), (5,2), (3,8), (4,2), (6,4), (1,3), (6,8); for unknown pairs (e.g., (3,1) in test), the code attempts to swap/adapt from known similar pairs like (1,3) or defaults to a generic H-pattern, but this often fails to match expected outputs.
 * Patterns apply only to the bottom 3 rows of a block (num_p=3), with plain uniform rows above; borders are always preserved/reapplied as [border] + pattern + [border].
 * Subtle: Patterns must exactly match expected motifs (e.g., for (4,3), expected has a central horizontal bar of 4's split by interiors in rows 14-16, but generated often shifts or simplifies them); vertical alignment and exact positions matter, and blocks don't overlap or span the full width if interiors vary.
 * Grids may have multiple blocks separated by background or thin lines; small/mixed areas (e.g., 1-3 row uniforms) stay as background.
 * Easy to miss: Interior must be strictly uniform and != border; scanning is top-down and skips non-potential starts; for swapped colors (e.g., (3,1) vs (1,3)), adaptation inverts colors in the template but may not preserve the exact motif shape.
 * Non-block rows (e.g., pure background like rows of 1's or 8's) remain unchanged.
 * Grid width is fixed at 24, with patterns designed for 22 interior cells; partial blocks or irregular shapes aren't handled—only full-width uniforms qualify.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly detects background (e.g., 1 in train1, 8 in train2/train test, 4 in train3) and initializes output properly, leaving pure background rows unchanged (e.g., top/bottom rows of 1's/8's/4's match expected).
 * Successfully identifies and measures block heights (e.g., (4,3) block rows 10-16 in train1, height=7; (5,2) rows 18-23, height=6; similar for others), and applies borders correctly in outputs.
 * For known patterns like (5,2) in train1 and (6,4) in train2, the motif positions are partially correct (e.g., central bars and legs appear), showing adaptation logic has potential.
 * However, all training examples failed: In train1, (4,3) block has incorrect pattern in rows 14-16—generated has uniform 3's with misplaced 4's (e.g., row15: 3's then single 4 then more 3's, but expected has clustered 4's at cols 7-12 and 17-? wait, actually expected row15 has 4 at col8 only? No—expected row14/16: 3's with 4's at 7-12; row15: 3's with 4 at 8 and 14; generated mismatches by having row14/16 identical but row15 with 4's at wrong spots (e.g., 4's at 7-13? Listing shows generated row15: [4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4] vs expected [4,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4]—positions of 4's shifted right by 1 in middle).
 * Train1 (3,8) block rows 27-30: generated has uniform 8's in row27 (wrong, expected has 8's with 3's at start/end), and rows28-30 mismatch—generated row28: [3,8*21,3,3,8*4] but expected row28: [3,8,8,8*13,3,3,8*4] wait no, from listing: generated row27 all 8's (fail), row28/29 have early 3's misplaced; expected has varying 3 positions (e.g., row30: 3,8,8,3 +8's +3,3+8's).
 * Train2: (4,2) block rows13-19 height=7, generated patterns close but row16/17 identical and wrong—expected row16/17 have 4's at start then 2's with specific 4 insertions (e.g., expected row16: [4,4,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] vs generated same but starts with [4,2*6,4*? no—generated row16: [4,4,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] wait, actually matches expected for row16/17 in listing? Wait, train2 generated row16: [4,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] no, listing shows generated row15 all 2's interior (plain), row18 has 4's misplaced; overall mismatches in vertical legs (e.g., expected row17/18 identical with more 4's at end).
 * Train3: (1,3) block rows16-23 height=8, but generated uses plain 3's for most (only bottom 3 patterned wrong—e.g., row20: [1,3*21,1] plain vs expected patterned; row21: generated [1,3,3,3* ,1,1,3*] but expected [1,3,3,3,3,3,3,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,1] with 1's at 7-8; adaptation from (1,3) to itself? But positions off. (6,8) block rows24-28: generated row26 all 8's (plain wrong), row27/28 have 6's misplaced (e.g., generated [6,8*12,6*6,8*3] vs expected clustered 6's at end).
 * get_pattern_for_block adaptation is broken for unknowns (e.g., inverts colors but doesn't adjust motif for new border/interior roles, leading to swapped but shape-mismatched outputs).
 * scan_and_apply_blocks skips small blocks correctly but overwrites only if h>=4, yet in train3 top 16 rows are all 4's (background?) but generated correctly as 4's; however, (1,3) detection starts at row16 but patterns apply wrong.
 * No extraction of arbitrary objects—code assumes full-width blocks only; unhelpful for partial or non-uniform shapes.
 * initialize_output_to_background is helpful and correct; is_potential_block_start is mostly accurate but too rigid (assumes exact 22 uniform).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it mostly fills with background 8's (correct for top/bottom), but mishandles blocks: (3,1) block (rows14-18?) has patterns that appear swapped from (1,3)—e.g., row16: [3,1*6,3*3,1* ,3* ] with 3's as "interior" motifs but positions don't form expected H (expected likely inverts (1,3) properly with 1's as borders and 3's patterned, but generated has irregular 3's in row17/18 like [3,1,1,3,3,1,3,3,3,3,1*10,3] which seems over-patterned/misplaced). (1,2) block rows25-28: generated has [1,2,1,1,1,2*16,1] etc., attempting adaptation from (5,2) but colors swapped wrong (2's as border? No—key=(1,2), adapts to have 1's as interior motifs but shapes don't match expected zigzag or H for (1,2); looks like partial plain with misplaced 1's/2's, e.g., row27 has extra 1's interrupting 2's). (4,3) block rows29-32: applies known (4,3) but only bottom 3 rows patterned, top plain—generated row29 all 3's interior (correct plain), but row30/31/32 have 4's shifted (similar to train1 error, e.g., row31: 4's at wrong cols like 7-? vs expected clustered). Overall, test output preserves structure but pattern positions/colors are off by 1-2 cols or inverted incorrectly, leaving non-block rows (e.g., row19 all 8's, row24 all 8's) correct but blocks visually distorted—not matching a coherent puzzle solution.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
