=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 21:45:33] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:14:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top portion contains small, irregular "shapes" (non-background patterns) made of a few colors, and the bottom portion contains "large blocks" that are rectangular frames with a consistent border color on the edges and a single fill color in the interior. The goal is to detect these small shapes early in the grid and "replicate" or "stamp" them into the bottom rows of subsequent large blocks by mapping the small shape's colors to the block's border (for outline-like parts) and fill (for interior parts), while setting all non-large-block rows to the background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is always the color at g[0][0], and all non-large-block rows should be entirely set to bg in the output, including any small shapes—small shapes are only used as templates for replication, not preserved in place.
 * Large blocks are strictly defined: sequences of 2+ rows where each row has exactly two colors (border on columns 0 and n_cols-1, fill everywhere else from 1 to n_cols-2), with border != fill; they must be contiguous vertically and the entire row must match this pattern (no interruptions).
 * Small shapes are contiguous vertical groups of non-bg rows, horizontally grouped into minimal bounding intervals (connected columns); they can span multiple rows/columns but are "small" if not qualifying as large blocks; ignore empty or all-bg groups.
 * Replication logic: For each small shape appearing before a large block (s_end < b_start), if the shape's height <= block's height, extract the unique non-bg colors in the shape (1 or 2 colors expected); map them to the block's border/fill such that the shape's "outline" color maps to border and "interior" to fill (if 1 color, it maps to border if it matches fill? Wait, code has inconsistencies here); place the mapped pattern in the bottom sh rows of the block (overwriting the fill), keeping the block's border intact where the shape doesn't overlap.
 * Subtleties: Color mapping is not always straightforward— if shape has 1 color, it should map to border only if it matches the block's fill? But code tries to match fill first; if 2 colors, assign the one matching block's fill to border and the other to fill, but this fails if neither matches or mapping is swapped. Placement is always at the bottom of the block, aligned to the shape's left/right columns, but only overwrite interior (not borders). Shapes must be "applied" only to blocks they precede, and only if height fits; multiple shapes may apply to one block? But code applies sequentially, which may overwrite. Non-large rows (including small shapes) are blanked to bg early, so output only shows large blocks with applied patterns. Easy to miss: shapes can have holes or irregular forms, but bounding box is used; horizontal intervals must be connected (no gaps in cols). Bg rows separate sections, and large blocks can't have side variations. In test, bg=8, small shapes use 3/1 and 1/2, large at bottom uses 4/3—mapping must preserve pattern fidelity without assuming which color is "border" in small shape.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def find_small_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Extracts vertical groups of non-bg rows, then finds minimal horizontal bounding intervals (connected columns) for each group.
    # Returns list of (start_row, height, left_col, right_col) for each small shape.
    # Useful for identifying template patterns, but may over-group if shapes span multiple intervals—handles connected cols well.
    # Subtle: Filters to rows with any non-bg in the interval; ignores all-bg.
```
```python
def find_large_blocks(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Scans for contiguous row sequences matching large block criteria: exactly 2 colors per row, border on edges, fill in middle, border != fill.
    # Returns list of (start_row, height, border_color, fill_color).
    # Essential for detecting replication targets; strict criteria prevent false positives, but misses if rows have edge variations (e.g., row[1] != row[n-2]).
    # Note: Code checks row[1] == row[n-2] explicitly, which is good for consistency.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Generated output blanks top rows to bg correctly and detects large blocks (e.g., rows 10-16 with border 4/fill 3, rows 18-23 with 5/2, rows 25-28 with 3/8? Wait, bottom is 3/8 but expected similar), but replication fails in the 5/2 block: row 21 has extra 5's in columns 8-11 (generated: 5,5,5,5 vs expected: 2,2,2,2), and row 22 has 5's in 8-11 (generated: 5,5,5,5 vs expected: 2,2,2,2? Wait, expected row 22 has 5,5,5,5 in 8-11 actually—no, per text, expected row 22: [5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2,...] wait, they match for row 22 but differ in row 21 (generated has 5's where expected has 2's in middle-right); likely wrong color mapping (shape's colors not correctly assigned to fill/border, causing over-bordering). Bottom 3/8 block also mismatched in row 28 (generated: 3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,3 vs expected: 3,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,3)—generated has 8's where expected has 3's in col 3 and 17-18. Overall, detects structures but mapping/placement buggy.
 * Training example 2: Similar issues—blanks non-large to bg (all 8's in top/bottom), detects blocks (e.g., 4/2 in rows 13-21, 6/4 in 23-28), but replication in 4/2 block has incorrect patterns (e.g., row 17 generated: [4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] vs expected same? Wait, matches some, but row 18: generated [4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] vs expected same; actually, mismatches in bottom 6/4 block row 25: generated [6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6] vs expected same, but row 26 generated [6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6] vs expected [6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6]—generated inserts extra 6's prematurely; row 28 generated [3,8,8,3,8,... wait no, this is train2, ends with all 8's? Per text, mismatches in row 24-26 where generated has irregular 6's/4's but expected has solid 4's in row 24. Mapping assumes wrong color assignments, causing patterns to use border color in interior spots.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—whatever the input was, the program handled detection, mapping, and placement perfectly, suggesting core structure detection works when colors/shapes align simply (e.g., 1-2 colors, clear outline/interior).
 * find_small_shapes is helpful but buggy: it groups entire vertical non-bg spans into one, then splits horizontal intervals, but may create too-wide bounds if shapes have gaps; misses per-row active cols properly in some cases. find_large_blocks is solid for detection but assumes perfect row uniformity (e.g., checks row[1]==row[n-2], which is good but rigid). The main program blanks non-large rows early (good), but replication loop skips if s_end >= b_start (correct for sequencing), checks height (good), but color mapping is flawed: for 2 colors, it picks the one matching fill to map to border (but should infer which is "border-like" in shape?); for 1 color, maps to border only if !=fill, but often fails. Placement overwrites only if colr in mapped and !=bg, but aligns to large_r = b_start + b_h - sh + k (bottom-aligned, good), yet doesn't preserve block borders (overwrites edges if shape touches them). No handling for multiple shapes per block or overlapping applications. Unhelpful: The initial row blanking uses a similar but not identical check to find_large_blocks, causing inconsistency (e.g., blanks rows that might be partial blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output blanks non-large rows to bg=8 correctly (top 13 rows all 8's, bottom spacer rows 19 and 24 all 8's? Wait, row 19 is the bottom of first small? No, output shows patterns in 15-18 and 20-23, but per logic should blank small shapes—wait, generated keeps small shapes visible, which is wrong: rows 15-18 show [3,1,1,...3] pattern (not blanked), rows 20-23 show [1,2,2,...1], and bottom rows 25-28 have partial [4,3,3,...4] with some 4's inserted in row 27-28, but only 2 rows shown with patterns while block seems taller. This does not look correct: small shapes should be blanked to 8's (not preserved), and the bottom 4/3 block should have the preceding small shapes (3/1 and 1/2 patterns) stamped into its bottom with proper mapping (e.g., 1->3 fill, 3->4 border for first shape; 2->3, 1->4 for second?), creating replicated irregular patterns in bottom rows of the 4/3 block, but generated has irregular 4's in middle of row 27-28 without full replication or blanking tops. Differences: Expected should have all small shape rows (14-18,20-23) as all 8's, and only the bottom block (25-28?) with stamped patterns (e.g., row 27 mirroring a small shape with 4/3, row 28 another); generated fails to blank smalls and misapplies/misaligns stamps (e.g., row 27 has 4's in cols 9-12,15-18 but not matching any small shape exactly—unknown why, perhaps wrong interval detection or mapping swap).

[2025-10-02 22:14:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:43:25] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers (likely representing colors or tiles) to reconstruct or complete "objects" such as bordered rectangular shapes with interior fills, where the input may have irregular or partial representations of these shapes scattered across rows, and the goal is to identify background, extract shape templates from irregularities, and overlay them correctly onto uniform blocks of rows to form coherent, bordered patterns. The output should preserve and complete these shapes while filling the rest with the dominant background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is the most frequent value in fully uniform rows; if none, default to the top-left cell—subtlety: this works for uniform backgrounds but fails if backgrounds vary or if shapes bleed into what looks like background.
 * Shapes are bordered rectangles: detect via rows where edges match a border color (b) and interior is uniform fill color (i ≠ bkg, i ≠ b); requires at least 3 columns and consecutive identical rows (l > 1) to qualify as a block.
 * Irregular rows in input contain "templates" for shapes: extract non-bkg positions per value (val), grouping columns (sorted unique) per row (r); subtlety: templates are per value (potential fill or border), but clustering assumes consecutive rows form shape parts—misses non-consecutive or overlapping shapes.
 * After extraction, fill all irregular rows with bkg to create uniform blocks, then process each block of consecutive uniform rows: if bordered and i ≠ bkg, overlay the longest cluster of templates (main_clus) starting from block_start + l - m (aligning to end), using border color b on those columns; for smaller clusters, overlay on the last h_small rows of the block using b.
 * Subtlety: Clustering templates by consecutive rows (prev_r +1), but assumes all templates for i are for the same shape—fails if multiple shapes share i or if columns don't align perfectly; also, overlays only use b (border), not i (fill), leading to incomplete interiors.
 * Overlays check bounds but don't handle column overlaps or merging; assumes width is consistent, but inputs may have varying row lengths (though code assumes fixed width).
 * Easy to miss: Shapes can have internal irregularities (e.g., holes or sub-patterns like in expected outputs with mixed 4/3 or 5/2), but code only overlays borders, ignoring fill restoration; multiple shapes per block (e.g., train1 has separate 3/4 block, 2/5 block, 8/3 block) require separate template handling without cross-contamination.
 * Background rows (all bkg) should remain untouched; non-bordered uniform rows stay as-is.
 * Outputs must match exact expected patterns, including asymmetries or specific irregularities in shapes (e.g., train1 row 15 has partial 4s in middle, row 16 has scattered 3/4/5 mix)—code over-simplifies to uniform borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_bkg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            c = row[0]
            count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if count:
        return max(count, key=count.get)
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This function correctly identifies the background as the most common uniform row value, useful for initialization and filling.)

```python
def is_bordered(row: List[int]) -> tuple:
    if len(row) < 3 or row[0] != row[-1]:
        return False, None, None
    b = row[0]
    i = row[1]
    if all(x == i for x in row[1:-1]) and b != i:
        return True, b, i
    return False, None, None
```
(This detects simple bordered rows with uniform interior; helpful as a base but misses complex interiors like partial fills or holes—extend for non-uniform i.)

```python
# Template extraction snippet (from program)
templates = defaultdict(list)
for r in range(height):
    orig_row = g[r]
    if all(x == bkg for x in orig_row):
        continue
    col_dict = defaultdict(list)
    for c in range(width):
        val = orig_row[c]
        if val != bkg:
            col_dict[val].append(c)
    for val, cols in col_dict.items():
        templates[val].append((r, sorted(set(cols))))
```
(This extracts positions of non-background elements per value, grouping columns; useful for identifying shape fragments but needs better clustering for non-consecutive rows.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, producing uniform grids filled only with background (1 for train1, 8 for train2, 4 for train3), ignoring all shapes.
 * Train1 generated all 1s, but expected has three distinct bordered shapes: a 4-bordered 3-fill block (rows 10-16, with irregularities like partial 4s and mixed 3/4/5 in rows 15-16), a 5-bordered 2-fill block (rows 18-23, similar irregularities), and a 3-bordered 8-fill block (rows 27-29, with 3/8 mixes); code filled everything with bkg=1 and failed to overlay any templates correctly, missing cluster alignment and fill restoration.
 * Train2 generated all 8s (bkg), but expected has a 4-bordered 2-fill block (rows 13-20, with complex internal 4/2 mixes forming patterns like diagonals or sub-shapes) and a 6-bordered 4-fill block (rows 24-28, with 6/4 mixes); code detected bkg=8 correctly but didn't process overlays, treating the entire grid as background blocks without shapes.
 * Train3 generated all 4s (bkg), but expected has a 1-bordered 3-fill block (rows 16-22, with 1/3 mixes creating irregular borders/interiors) and a 6-bordered 8-fill block (rows 25-29, with 6/8 mixes in columns 13-20); code filled with bkg=4 and skipped overlays, possibly due to no bordered uniform rows after filling.
 * Template extraction works partially (collects non-bkg positions), but clustering into main_clus and small clusters assumes vertical consecutiveness and overlays only borders (b) on end-aligned rows, which misaligns shapes (e.g., doesn't match expected positions) and leaves interiors as bkg instead of i or mixed.
 * is_bordered is too strict (requires uniform i), failing on expected irregular interiors; doesn't handle non-bordered shapes or vertical borders.
 * find_bkg is helpful and correct for these cases, but overall program over-fills with bkg early, losing irregularity data needed for complex shapes.
 * No handling for multiple values per shape (e.g., borders and fills mixed in templates); overlays don't merge or prioritize (e.g., if columns overlap, last write wins, but code doesn't conflict-check).
 * Function for processing groups (while r < height loop) identifies consecutive uniforms correctly post-fill, but skips non-bordered blocks and assumes i in templates—fails if templates lack matching i.
 * Unhelpful: The overlay logic for small clusters (overlay on last h_small rows) is broken for train1/2, as it places borders incorrectly (e.g., doesn't recreate expected scattered patterns like 5/2 in row 22 of train1).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is all 8s across the entire 30x24 grid, which does not look correct—it appears to have treated the whole input as background without detecting or reconstructing any shapes, similar to failures in train2/3.
 * No shapes or irregularities are present in the output, but based on patterns in training examples, the test likely expects multiple bordered blocks (e.g., similar to train1's 3-4 shape blocks) with mixed border/fill values (possibly 4/2, 6/4, 1/3 like trains) overlaid in specific row ranges (e.g., rows 13-20, 24-28); all-8s misses this entirely, suggesting the program failed template extraction or block processing for the test input's irregularities.
 * This uniform output ignores subtle elements like internal patterns or non-consecutive templates, making it invalid—test probably has scattered non-8 values in certain rows that should form bordered objects, but code filled them away without proper restoration.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 22:43:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers (likely representing colors or tiles) to reconstruct or complete "objects" such as bordered rectangular shapes with interior fills, where the input may have irregular or partial representations of these shapes scattered across rows, and the goal is to identify background, extract shape templates from irregularities, and overlay them correctly onto uniform blocks of rows to form coherent, bordered patterns. The output should preserve and complete these shapes while filling the rest with the dominant background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bkg) is the most frequent value in fully uniform rows; if none, default to the top-left cell—subtlety: this works for uniform backgrounds but fails if backgrounds vary or if shapes bleed into what looks like background.
 * Shapes are bordered rectangles: detect via rows where edges match a border color (b) and interior is uniform fill color (i ≠ bkg, i ≠ b); requires at least 3 columns and consecutive identical rows (l > 1) to qualify as a block.
 * Irregular rows in input contain "templates" for shapes: extract non-bkg positions per value (val), grouping columns (sorted unique) per row (r); subtlety: templates are per value (potential fill or border), but clustering assumes consecutive rows form shape parts—misses non-consecutive or overlapping shapes.
 * After extraction, fill all irregular rows with bkg to create uniform blocks, then process each block of consecutive uniform rows: if bordered and i ≠ bkg, overlay the longest cluster of templates (main_clus) starting from block_start + l - m (aligning to end), using border color b on those columns; for smaller clusters, overlay on the last h_small rows of the block using b.
 * Subtlety: Clustering templates by consecutive rows (prev_r +1), but assumes all templates for i are for the same shape—fails if multiple shapes share i or if columns don't align perfectly; also, overlays only use b (border), not i (fill), leading to incomplete interiors.
 * Overlays check bounds but don't handle column overlaps or merging; assumes width is consistent, but inputs may have varying row lengths (though code assumes fixed width).
 * Easy to miss: Shapes can have internal irregularities (e.g., holes or sub-patterns like in expected outputs with mixed 4/3 or 5/2), but code only overlays borders, ignoring fill restoration; multiple shapes per block (e.g., train1 has separate 3/4 block, 2/5 block, 8/3 block) require separate template handling without cross-contamination.
 * Background rows (all bkg) should remain untouched; non-bordered uniform rows stay as-is.
 * Outputs must match exact expected patterns, including asymmetries or specific irregularities in shapes (e.g., train1 row 15 has partial 4s in middle, row 16 has scattered 3/4/5 mix)—code over-simplifies to uniform borders.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_bkg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            c = row[0]
            count[c] = count.get(c, 0) + 1
    if count:
        return max(count, key=count.get)
    return g[0][0] if g and g[0] else 0
```
(This function correctly identifies the background as the most common uniform row value, useful for initialization and filling.)

```python
def is_bordered(row: List[int]) -> tuple:
    if len(row) < 3 or row[0] != row[-1]:
        return False, None, None
    b = row[0]
    i = row[1]
    if all(x == i for x in row[1:-1]) and b != i:
        return True, b, i
    return False, None, None
```
(This detects simple bordered rows with uniform interior; helpful as a base but misses complex interiors like partial fills or holes—extend for non-uniform i.)

```python
# Template extraction snippet (from program)
templates = defaultdict(list)
for r in range(height):
    orig_row = g[r]
    if all(x == bkg for x in orig_row):
        continue
    col_dict = defaultdict(list)
    for c in range(width):
        val = orig_row[c]
        if val != bkg:
            col_dict[val].append(c)
    for val, cols in col_dict.items():
        templates[val].append((r, sorted(set(cols))))
```
(This extracts positions of non-background elements per value, grouping columns; useful for identifying shape fragments but needs better clustering for non-consecutive rows.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All three training examples failed completely, producing uniform grids filled only with background (1 for train1, 8 for train2, 4 for train3), ignoring all shapes.
 * Train1 generated all 1s, but expected has three distinct bordered shapes: a 4-bordered 3-fill block (rows 10-16, with irregularities like partial 4s and mixed 3/4/5 in rows 15-16), a 5-bordered 2-fill block (rows 18-23, similar irregularities), and a 3-bordered 8-fill block (rows 27-29, with 3/8 mixes); code filled everything with bkg=1 and failed to overlay any templates correctly, missing cluster alignment and fill restoration.
 * Train2 generated all 8s (bkg), but expected has a 4-bordered 2-fill block (rows 13-20, with complex internal 4/2 mixes forming patterns like diagonals or sub-shapes) and a 6-bordered 4-fill block (rows 24-28, with 6/4 mixes); code detected bkg=8 correctly but didn't process overlays, treating the entire grid as background blocks without shapes.
 * Train3 generated all 4s (bkg), but expected has a 1-bordered 3-fill block (rows 16-22, with 1/3 mixes creating irregular borders/interiors) and a 6-bordered 8-fill block (rows 25-29, with 6/8 mixes in columns 13-20); code filled with bkg=4 and skipped overlays, possibly due to no bordered uniform rows after filling.
 * Template extraction works partially (collects non-bkg positions), but clustering into main_clus and small clusters assumes vertical consecutiveness and overlays only borders (b) on end-aligned rows, which misaligns shapes (e.g., doesn't match expected positions) and leaves interiors as bkg instead of i or mixed.
 * is_bordered is too strict (requires uniform i), failing on expected irregular interiors; doesn't handle non-bordered shapes or vertical borders.
 * find_bkg is helpful and correct for these cases, but overall program over-fills with bkg early, losing irregularity data needed for complex shapes.
 * No handling for multiple values per shape (e.g., borders and fills mixed in templates); overlays don't merge or prioritize (e.g., if columns overlap, last write wins, but code doesn't conflict-check).
 * Function for processing groups (while r < height loop) identifies consecutive uniforms correctly post-fill, but skips non-bordered blocks and assumes i in templates—fails if templates lack matching i.
 * Unhelpful: The overlay logic for small clusters (overlay on last h_small rows) is broken for train1/2, as it places borders incorrectly (e.g., doesn't recreate expected scattered patterns like 5/2 in row 22 of train1).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is all 8s across the entire 30x24 grid, which does not look correct—it appears to have treated the whole input as background without detecting or reconstructing any shapes, similar to failures in train2/3.
 * No shapes or irregularities are present in the output, but based on patterns in training examples, the test likely expects multiple bordered blocks (e.g., similar to train1's 3-4 shape blocks) with mixed border/fill values (possibly 4/2, 6/4, 1/3 like trains) overlaid in specific row ranges (e.g., rows 13-20, 24-28); all-8s misses this entirely, suggesting the program failed template extraction or block processing for the test input's irregularities.
 * This uniform output ignores subtle elements like internal patterns or non-consecutive templates, making it invalid—test probably has scattered non-8 values in certain rows that should form bordered objects, but code filled them away without proper restoration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where the top portion contains small, irregular "shapes" (non-background patterns) made of a few colors, and the bottom portion contains "large blocks" that are rectangular frames with a consistent border color on the edges and a single fill color in the interior. The goal is to detect these small shapes early in the grid and "replicate" or "stamp" them into the bottom rows of subsequent large blocks by mapping the small shape's colors to the block's border (for outline-like parts) and fill (for interior parts), while setting all non-large-block rows to the background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color (bg) is always the color at g[0][0], and all non-large-block rows should be entirely set to bg in the output, including any small shapes—small shapes are only used as templates for replication, not preserved in place.
 * Large blocks are strictly defined: sequences of 2+ rows where each row has exactly two colors (border on columns 0 and n_cols-1, fill everywhere else from 1 to n_cols-2), with border != fill; they must be contiguous vertically and the entire row must match this pattern (no interruptions).
 * Small shapes are contiguous vertical groups of non-bg rows, horizontally grouped into minimal bounding intervals (connected columns); they can span multiple rows/columns but are "small" if not qualifying as large blocks; ignore empty or all-bg groups.
 * Replication logic: For each small shape appearing before a large block (s_end < b_start), if the shape's height <= block's height, extract the unique non-bg colors in the shape (1 or 2 colors expected); map them to the block's border/fill such that the shape's "outline" color maps to border and "interior" to fill (if 1 color, it maps to border if it matches fill? Wait, code has inconsistencies here); place the mapped pattern in the bottom sh rows of the block (overwriting the fill), keeping the block's border intact where the shape doesn't overlap.
 * Subtleties: Color mapping is not always straightforward— if shape has 1 color, it should map to border only if it matches the block's fill? But code tries to match fill first; if 2 colors, assign the one matching block's fill to border and the other to fill, but this fails if neither matches or mapping is swapped. Placement is always at the bottom of the block, aligned to the shape's left/right columns, but only overwrite interior (not borders). Shapes must be "applied" only to blocks they precede, and only if height fits; multiple shapes may apply to one block? But code applies sequentially, which may overwrite. Non-large rows (including small shapes) are blanked to bg early, so output only shows large blocks with applied patterns. Easy to miss: shapes can have holes or irregular forms, but bounding box is used; horizontal intervals must be connected (no gaps in cols). Bg rows separate sections, and large blocks can't have side variations. In test, bg=8, small shapes use 3/1 and 1/2, large at bottom uses 4/3—mapping must preserve pattern fidelity without assuming which color is "border" in small shape.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

def find_small_shapes(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Extracts vertical groups of non-bg rows, then finds minimal horizontal bounding intervals (connected columns) for each group.
    # Returns list of (start_row, height, left_col, right_col) for each small shape.
    # Useful for identifying template patterns, but may over-group if shapes span multiple intervals—handles connected cols well.
    # Subtle: Filters to rows with any non-bg in the interval; ignores all-bg.
```
```python
def find_large_blocks(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    # Scans for contiguous row sequences matching large block criteria: exactly 2 colors per row, border on edges, fill in middle, border != fill.
    # Returns list of (start_row, height, border_color, fill_color).
    # Essential for detecting replication targets; strict criteria prevent false positives, but misses if rows have edge variations (e.g., row[1] != row[n-2]).
    # Note: Code checks row[1] == row[n-2] explicitly, which is good for consistency.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Generated output blanks top rows to bg correctly and detects large blocks (e.g., rows 10-16 with border 4/fill 3, rows 18-23 with 5/2, rows 25-28 with 3/8? Wait, bottom is 3/8 but expected similar), but replication fails in the 5/2 block: row 21 has extra 5's in columns 8-11 (generated: 5,5,5,5 vs expected: 2,2,2,2), and row 22 has 5's in 8-11 (generated: 5,5,5,5 vs expected: 2,2,2,2? Wait, expected row 22 has 5,5,5,5 in 8-11 actually—no, per text, expected row 22: [5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2,...] wait, they match for row 22 but differ in row 21 (generated has 5's where expected has 2's in middle-right); likely wrong color mapping (shape's colors not correctly assigned to fill/border, causing over-bordering). Bottom 3/8 block also mismatched in row 28 (generated: 3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,3 vs expected: 3,8,8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,8,8,8,8,3)—generated has 8's where expected has 3's in col 3 and 17-18. Overall, detects structures but mapping/placement buggy.
 * Training example 2: Similar issues—blanks non-large to bg (all 8's in top/bottom), detects blocks (e.g., 4/2 in rows 13-21, 6/4 in 23-28), but replication in 4/2 block has incorrect patterns (e.g., row 17 generated: [4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] vs expected same? Wait, matches some, but row 18: generated [4,4,4,4,4,2,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,4,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,4] vs expected same; actually, mismatches in bottom 6/4 block row 25: generated [6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6] vs expected same, but row 26 generated [6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,4,6,6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6] vs expected [6,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,6]—generated inserts extra 6's prematurely; row 28 generated [3,8,8,3,8,... wait no, this is train2, ends with all 8's? Per text, mismatches in row 24-26 where generated has irregular 6's/4's but expected has solid 4's in row 24. Mapping assumes wrong color assignments, causing patterns to use border color in interior spots.
 * Training example 3: CORRECT—whatever the input was, the program handled detection, mapping, and placement perfectly, suggesting core structure detection works when colors/shapes align simply (e.g., 1-2 colors, clear outline/interior).
 * find_small_shapes is helpful but buggy: it groups entire vertical non-bg spans into one, then splits horizontal intervals, but may create too-wide bounds if shapes have gaps; misses per-row active cols properly in some cases. find_large_blocks is solid for detection but assumes perfect row uniformity (e.g., checks row[1]==row[n-2], which is good but rigid). The main program blanks non-large rows early (good), but replication loop skips if s_end >= b_start (correct for sequencing), checks height (good), but color mapping is flawed: for 2 colors, it picks the one matching fill to map to border (but should infer which is "border-like" in shape?); for 1 color, maps to border only if !=fill, but often fails. Placement overwrites only if colr in mapped and !=bg, but aligns to large_r = b_start + b_h - sh + k (bottom-aligned, good), yet doesn't preserve block borders (overwrites edges if shape touches them). No handling for multiple shapes per block or overlapping applications. Unhelpful: The initial row blanking uses a similar but not identical check to find_large_blocks, causing inconsistency (e.g., blanks rows that might be partial blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output blanks non-large rows to bg=8 correctly (top 13 rows all 8's, bottom spacer rows 19 and 24 all 8's? Wait, row 19 is the bottom of first small? No, output shows patterns in 15-18 and 20-23, but per logic should blank small shapes—wait, generated keeps small shapes visible, which is wrong: rows 15-18 show [3,1,1,...3] pattern (not blanked), rows 20-23 show [1,2,2,...1], and bottom rows 25-28 have partial [4,3,3,...4] with some 4's inserted in row 27-28, but only 2 rows shown with patterns while block seems taller. This does not look correct: small shapes should be blanked to 8's (not preserved), and the bottom 4/3 block should have the preceding small shapes (3/1 and 1/2 patterns) stamped into its bottom with proper mapping (e.g., 1->3 fill, 3->4 border for first shape; 2->3, 1->4 for second?), creating replicated irregular patterns in bottom rows of the 4/3 block, but generated has irregular 4's in middle of row 27-28 without full replication or blanking tops. Differences: Expected should have all small shape rows (14-18,20-23) as all 8's, and only the bottom block (25-28?) with stamped patterns (e.g., row 27 mirroring a small shape with 4/3, row 28 another); generated fails to blank smalls and misapplies/misaligns stamps (e.g., row 27 has 4's in cols 9-12,15-18 but not matching any small shape exactly—unknown why, perhaps wrong interval detection or mapping swap).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 22:55:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to process a grid representing a scene with background and foreground "objects" (bordered regions with uniform fills), simplifying the output by clearing non-significant areas to the background color while reconstructing or preserving the borders of large, vertically stacked bordered objects based on patterns extracted from similar earlier structures in the grid. The output retains only the most prominent (large) objects, aligned and bordered using templates from prior occurrences, effectively "rendering" a cleaned-up version of the scene.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined by the most frequent color in fully uniform rows; if none, default to the top-left cell—easy to miss if grids have no uniform rows or if ties occur.
 * Bordered rows are detected as having matching first/last elements (border color b), with a uniform interior (fill color i) different from b and at least 3 cells wide; stacks of 2+ consecutive such rows with consistent b and i qualify as "large blocks" to preserve.
 * Non-large-block rows (and entire rows outside large blocks) are cleared to bg, but borders are only drawn in interior positions (not edges) using templates.
 * Templates are per color value: for each row, collect unique non-bg column positions where that value appears, stored as (row_index, sorted_cols_list); only used for the fill color of a large block.
 * Templates are filtered to those before the large block's start row (rel_templ), then clustered into consecutive row groups (by row_index +1 sequences).
 * For rendering large blocks: Use the largest cluster (main_clus) to place its column patterns as borders (value b) in the bottom-aligned portion of the block (br = start + h - main_h + k); smaller clusters are sorted by their ending row descending and bottom-aligned similarly (br = start + h - sh + k), but only if br is in bounds— this can cause overlaps or misalignments if clusters are short or spaced oddly.
 * Subtlety: Only interior columns (0 < c < width-1) get borders placed; edges remain as original b or cleared.
 * Objects must be "large" (h >=2 bordered rows) to trigger template-based bordering; single or non-bordered rows are fully cleared if outside large blocks.
 * Templates ignore bg entirely and collapse multiple same-value cols per row to unique sorted list, assuming sparse or patterned placements.
 * Potential miss: If no prior templates for a fill color, the block gets no bordering (just cleared interior? No, code skips continuing without clusters).
 * Vertical alignment is bottom-heavy for clusters, which may not match top-aligned or centered expectations in asymmetric objects.
 * Grids can have multiple disconnected objects of different colors/sizes; each large block is handled independently, but templates are global per color.
 * All rows in out start as copy of g, then non-large-block rows cleared to bg; bordering overwrites interiors selectively.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def find_bkg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for row in g:
        if len(set(row)) == 1:
            c = row[0]
            count[c] += 1
    if count:
        return max(count, key=count.get)
    return g[0][0] if g else 0
```
(This correctly identifies background from uniform rows; useful and accurate.)

```python
def is_bordered(row: List[int]) -> tuple:
    w = len(row)
    if w < 3 or row[0] != row[-1]:
        return False, None, None
    b = row[0]
    interior = row[1:w-1]
    if len(set(interior)) != 1 or interior[0] == b:
        return False, None, None
    i = interior[0]
    return True, b, i
```
(This detects simple bordered rows reliably; essential for identifying stacks, but assumes uniform interior—may miss non-uniform fills.)

```python
def get_clusters(templs: List[tuple[int, List[int]]]) -> List[List[tuple[int, List[int]]]]:
    if not templs:
        return []
    templs = sorted(templs, key=lambda x: x[0])
    clusters: List[List[tuple[int, List[int]]]] = []
    current = [templs[0]]
    for t in templs[1:]:
        if t[0] == current[-1][0] + 1:
            current.append(t)
        else:
            clusters.append(current)
            current = [t]
    clusters.append(current)
    return clusters
```
(This groups consecutive row templates; helpful for identifying pattern sequences, but only detects strictly sequential (+1) clusters—misses gaps.)

(The template extraction in program() is also helpful: builds per-value (row, unique_non_bg_cols) from earlier rows, enabling pattern reuse.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1: Correct, indicating solid handling of simple single large block with prior templates.
 * Training example 2: Incorrect; generated output differs from expected in the upper object (rows ~15-21): e.g., row 15 generated [4,4,4,4,4,2,...] but expected [4,2,2,2,2,2,...] (extra 4's in left interior, missing full 2-fill); row 16 generated [4,4,2,2,4,2,...] but expected [4,2,2,2,2,2,...] (misplaced 4's and partial fills); row 19 generated [4,2,2,2,2,2,...] but expected [4,4,2,2,4,2,...] (missing structured 4 borders); lower object (rows ~23-27) has similar issues like row 24 generated [6,4,6,6,4,4,...] but expected [6,4,4,4,4,4,...] (extra 6's in interior). This suggests misalignment in bottom-aligning clusters, causing borders to overwrite fills incorrectly or skip placements.
 * Training example 3: Correct, showing it works for another case, likely with better-aligned clusters or simpler structures.
 * Overall: Clearing non-large rows to bg works (top/bottom areas match expected all-8's); large block detection succeeds (preserves rough shapes); but template cluster placement fails for multi-cluster or asymmetric objects, leading to border/fill mismatches—bottom-alignment and sorting by end-row may not capture top-heavy or spaced patterns.
 * Template filtering to pre-block rows is key but can fail if no prior templates (skips bordering).
 * The col_dict in template extraction is helpful for collapsing positions but assumes all non-bg in a row for a value are part of one pattern—may over-simplify dense objects.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all in the program contribute, but cluster placement logic is broken for non-bottom-aligned cases (e.g., doesn't handle top or center alignment).

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: It correctly clears large top/bottom areas to 8 (bg, assuming 8 is background), preserves bordered structures in rows ~14-19 (3/1 patterns) and ~21-24 (1/2 patterns) and ~26-28 (4/3 patterns), suggesting large block detection works. However, row 14 is fully cleared to 8 while rows 15-16 have full [3,1,1,...,3] (uniform bordered), implying inconsistent clearing—expected should likely preserve a stack starting earlier if it's large. Row 17 [3,1,3,3,3,3,3,1,...,3] has clustered 3's on left but sparse 1's on right, which may be over-bordered (extra 3's not in a simple template). The 1/2 object in rows 21-24 has irregular placements (e.g., row 22 has 1's interrupting 2's mid-row), suggesting misaligned cluster bordering similar to training 2 errors—expected likely smoother fills with borders only on edges/patterns. The bottom 4/3 object is cut off (only 3 rows shown, ends abruptly), possibly missing a full stack or alignment. Overall, it demonstrates core detection but fails on precise bordering/placement, likely due to the same bottom-alignment issues; does not fully match a clean rendered scene.
