=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:08:40] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:28:19] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 27x27 grid through symmetry operations (reflections across center lines and points), pattern spreading (e.g., propagating 8's downward/upward from pairs of 2's or 8's), conditional modifications (e.g., converting 3's to 4's or adding 3's adjacent to 2 blocks), and bifurcated lower-half rules depending on the presence of 9's, where the upper half influences the lower via copying, doubling, or clearing patterns while preserving a central column of 1's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has rotational/point symmetry around the center (row/column 13, 0-indexed), but reflections are conditional (e.g., only copy if the target position is 4, and left-to-right is horizontal flip in upper half, while lower uses point reflection or shifted mirroring).
 * Upper half always applies: Detect "changed_rows" (rows 1-12) where row r-1 has adjacent 8's in even-odd column pairs (0-1, 2-3, etc., up to <13) above adjacent 2's in row r; then horizontally reflect upper-left non-4's to upper-right only if right target is 4; spread 8's downward into those changed_rows' left pairs if conditions met; convert all 3's in changed_rows' left half to 4's; conditionally spread 8's upward in right half (rows 0-12, columns 14+ even-odd pairs) if below has 8's and current has 4's; exception for rows below max changed_row with specific left pattern (2,2,3,3 at cols 5-8) clears right cols 18-21 to 4's.
 * Lower half splits on has_nine: If no 9, use point reflection (r2=26-r, c2=26-c) from upper-left to lower-right (rows 14+, cols 14+) only if target is 4; extend 2-blocks in lower by adding 3's to adjacent 4's (left blocks extend right, right blocks extend left, only within halves); for isolated single 2's in lower-left (no adjacent 2's horizontally), set directly below (row+1, same col) from 4 to 8 if it's 4; reflect/spread upper-left 8-block to lower-right via point reflection, then extend leftward by one col if possible, and spread downward row-by-row for the block's height if entire target row segment is 4's.
 * If has_nine, clear lower (rows 14-26) to 4's everywhere except central col 13=1; identify unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns (rows 0-12, cols 0-12), place them doubled (group consecutive same non-4 values into blocks, double each block's length, shift start by half total non-4 count in original row, place sequentially from left in lower-left) starting from bottom (row 26) upward, with 1 row for first unique, 2 for second, 4 for third, etc. (2^k rows per unique pattern); then for each upper row with non-4's in left, mirror to lower-right (target_row=26-r, target_col=26-c) without shift if target in bounds (cols 14+).
 * Subtleties: Doubling in has_nine preserves block identities but concatenates doubled lengths into a new sequence, starts placement at shifted col (max(0, first_non4_col - shift)); uniqueness ignores all-4 rows and duplicates exact tuple patterns; spreads/stretches stop if not all 4's in target; central row 13 is always all 1's in output; use original grid 'g' for conditions (e.g., changed_rows detection) to avoid mid-process overwrites; column pairs are even-odd starting from 0; lower clears override prior upper influences; isolated 2 rule only for single cells, not blocks; 8-spread in no-9 lower is height-limited and breaks if any non-4 in target segment.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections don't overwrite non-4's (only set if target==4); adding 3's to 2-blocks only where 4's exist and within half-boundaries (no cross-center); in has_nine, right reflection is per upper row to specific lower row, but only non-4 left cells, and cols wrap to 26-c (which may land in left for some); changed_rows exception uses original g and specific cols 5-8 pattern to clear cols 18-21 only in affected rows; upper-right spread is upward (from lower to upper), unlike left downward spread; no modifications to central column except setting to 1's; patterns like 9's trigger full lower rebuild from uniques, ignoring point reflection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helper classes or functions are defined in the program; all logic is inline in `program()`. The block extraction for doubling (in has_nine lower placement) is a helpful inline snippet that groups consecutive same values:
```python
# Inside has_nine lower placement loop
blocks = []
i = 0
while i < CENTER:
    if row_data[i] == 4:
        i += 1
        continue
    col = row_data[i]  # Note: 'col' reused confusingly for value
    j = i
    while j < CENTER and row_data[j] == col:
        j += 1
    l = j - i
    blocks.append((col, l))
    i = j
# Then compute n_non4 = sum(l for _, l in blocks), shift = n_non4 // 2, etc.
```
This is useful for identifying runs of numbers to double, but could be extracted to a function like `def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:` for clarity. No other tools; copy.deepcopy is used correctly for grid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt, so no prior iterations, but it demonstrates partial grasp of upper-half reflection/spread (e.g., horizontal flip and 8-propagation mostly work in train1 upper, as rows 0-3,4 match expected) but fails in details like not adding 3's correctly to right-side 2-blocks in lower no-9 case.
 * In train1 (no-9), upper changed_rows detection/spread works (8's in rows 4-5 left match), but lower point reflection misses some copies (e.g., row5 right has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2; row6 right has 3,3,2,2 matching but row7 right all 4's while expected also 4's? wait, row7 generated matches expected all 4's); add-3's logic applies but skips some right blocks (e.g., row18-20 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 matches expected, but row21 left has 2,3 instead of expected 2,3? minor, but row24 has 8,4 instead of all 4's, indicating over-spread of 8's); isolated 2 rule not triggering visibly; 8-block spread in lower right overextends (row24 has 8,8,8 while expected all 4's in that position, and row23 has 8,4 vs expected 4,4? wait, row23 expected all 4's pre-24).
 * In train1, exception clear not applying (row7 right cols18-21 should clear to 4's if pattern in row below changed, but generated has no 8's there anyway, so neutral); remove-3's in changed rows works (no 3's left in rows4-6 left).
 * In train2 (has-9), upper processing mostly matches (e.g., rows0-7,9-13 match expected, including 8/3 spreads and 9/2/1 placements), central row all 1's correct, but lower clear-then-place fails: unique patterns identified but doubling/shifting wrong (e.g., row20 left all 4's in generated but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1—suggests uniques placed but not doubled correctly or wrong order/shift; row23 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 matches but right has 1,1,2,2,9 instead of 4,4,3,8,4, indicating reflection applying to wrong targets or not skipping 4's); row24 left 4,4,9,9,... overplaces a pattern into what should be cleared 8,8,3,3; row25 left 4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3 matches expected but row26 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 same, but overall uniques seem to place 3 patterns (rows20-26 partially filled wrong).
 * Right reflection in has-9 applies but ignores bounds/shift (e.g., in train2 row23 right generated 1,1,2,2,9 from upper row3's left 3? but expected 3,8 from elsewhere? unknown why mismatch, possibly wrong target_col calc or applying to all non-4 without checking lower target==4).
 * Spread up right in upper works partially (train1 row3 right 8,8 matches), but in test generated, upper row2 right has 8,8 which may be over-spread.
 * No unhelpful functions; the inline block extraction is helpful but buggy in shift/placement (causes over/under-doubling in train2 lower left); the 8-spread down in no-9 lower breaks early correctly but initial reflection coords wrong (min_tc/max_tc from upper 8's point-reflected, but generated row24 8's where expected not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming has_nine=true due to 9's in upper) partially makes sense structurally (central col 1's correct, upper matches likely input transformations like 8/3/9/2/1 spreads in rows3-7,9-10; lower cleared to 4's/1's base, with some doubled-like patterns in rows20-26 left e.g., row25-26 has 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggesting partial unique doubling from upper row6-7's 9,2,2,1,1 but lengths not exactly doubled—9's are 4 in upper but 4 in lower left row25? wait, upper row5-6 has four 9's? input not shown but generated has four 9's left row5-6, so doubling to eight but placed as four? incomplete); right side reflections visible (e.g., row5-6 right 2,2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors left 2's/9's but shifted wrong, cols22-25 vs expected symmetric to left cols1-4? looks off by cols).
 * Does not look fully correct: Lower left placements irregular (row20 left all 4's but should place a unique if any; row21-22 left 4,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggests truncated doubling, missing full blocks; row23-24 left 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 but with extras like row25 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2 overlong, indicating wrong num_rows=1<<k assignment or shift causing overlap/out-of-bounds clipping); right lower has inconsistent mirrors (row20 right all 4's ok, but row25-26 right 3,3,8,8 vs left 2,2 not matching point-reflect of upper, and row23 right 2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors but expected more 8/3 from upper 8's?); upper row2 right 8,8 seems premature spread (if input has no triggering 4's below); overall, doubling logic fails to produce exact expected lengths/shifts, and reflections overwrite or miss, so likely incorrect—needs better unique selection (skip duplicates properly) and reflection bounds check (target_col >=14 and <=26).

[2025-10-01 15:28:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 27x27 grid through symmetry operations (reflections across center lines and points), pattern spreading (e.g., propagating 8's downward/upward from pairs of 2's or 8's), conditional modifications (e.g., converting 3's to 4's or adding 3's adjacent to 2 blocks), and bifurcated lower-half rules depending on the presence of 9's, where the upper half influences the lower via copying, doubling, or clearing patterns while preserving a central column of 1's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has rotational/point symmetry around the center (row/column 13, 0-indexed), but reflections are conditional (e.g., only copy if the target position is 4, and left-to-right is horizontal flip in upper half, while lower uses point reflection or shifted mirroring).
 * Upper half always applies: Detect "changed_rows" (rows 1-12) where row r-1 has adjacent 8's in even-odd column pairs (0-1, 2-3, etc., up to <13) above adjacent 2's in row r; then horizontally reflect upper-left non-4's to upper-right only if right target is 4; spread 8's downward into those changed_rows' left pairs if conditions met; convert all 3's in changed_rows' left half to 4's; conditionally spread 8's upward in right half (rows 0-12, columns 14+ even-odd pairs) if below has 8's and current has 4's; exception for rows below max changed_row with specific left pattern (2,2,3,3 at cols 5-8) clears right cols 18-21 to 4's.
 * Lower half splits on has_nine: If no 9, use point reflection (r2=26-r, c2=26-c) from upper-left to lower-right (rows 14+, cols 14+) only if target is 4; extend 2-blocks in lower by adding 3's to adjacent 4's (left blocks extend right, right blocks extend left, only within halves); for isolated single 2's in lower-left (no adjacent 2's horizontally), set directly below (row+1, same col) from 4 to 8 if it's 4; reflect/spread upper-left 8-block to lower-right via point reflection, then extend leftward by one col if possible, and spread downward row-by-row for the block's height if entire target row segment is 4's.
 * If has_nine, clear lower (rows 14-26) to 4's everywhere except central col 13=1; identify unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns (rows 0-12, cols 0-12), place them doubled (group consecutive same non-4 values into blocks, double each block's length, shift start by half total non-4 count in original row, place sequentially from left in lower-left) starting from bottom (row 26) upward, with 1 row for first unique, 2 for second, 4 for third, etc. (2^k rows per unique pattern); then for each upper row with non-4's in left, mirror to lower-right (target_row=26-r, target_col=26-c) without shift if target in bounds (cols 14+).
 * Subtleties: Doubling in has_nine preserves block identities but concatenates doubled lengths into a new sequence, starts placement at shifted col (max(0, first_non4_col - shift)); uniqueness ignores all-4 rows and duplicates exact tuple patterns; spreads/stretches stop if not all 4's in target; central row 13 is always all 1's in output; use original grid 'g' for conditions (e.g., changed_rows detection) to avoid mid-process overwrites; column pairs are even-odd starting from 0; lower clears override prior upper influences; isolated 2 rule only for single cells, not blocks; 8-spread in no-9 lower is height-limited and breaks if any non-4 in target segment.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections don't overwrite non-4's (only set if target==4); adding 3's to 2-blocks only where 4's exist and within half-boundaries (no cross-center); in has_nine, right reflection is per upper row to specific lower row, but only non-4 left cells, and cols wrap to 26-c (which may land in left for some); changed_rows exception uses original g and specific cols 5-8 pattern to clear cols 18-21 only in affected rows; upper-right spread is upward (from lower to upper), unlike left downward spread; no modifications to central column except setting to 1's; patterns like 9's trigger full lower rebuild from uniques, ignoring point reflection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helper classes or functions are defined in the program; all logic is inline in `program()`. The block extraction for doubling (in has_nine lower placement) is a helpful inline snippet that groups consecutive same values:
```python
# Inside has_nine lower placement loop
blocks = []
i = 0
while i < CENTER:
    if row_data[i] == 4:
        i += 1
        continue
    col = row_data[i]  # Note: 'col' reused confusingly for value
    j = i
    while j < CENTER and row_data[j] == col:
        j += 1
    l = j - i
    blocks.append((col, l))
    i = j
# Then compute n_non4 = sum(l for _, l in blocks), shift = n_non4 // 2, etc.
```
This is useful for identifying runs of numbers to double, but could be extracted to a function like `def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:` for clarity. No other tools; copy.deepcopy is used correctly for grid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt, so no prior iterations, but it demonstrates partial grasp of upper-half reflection/spread (e.g., horizontal flip and 8-propagation mostly work in train1 upper, as rows 0-3,4 match expected) but fails in details like not adding 3's correctly to right-side 2-blocks in lower no-9 case.
 * In train1 (no-9), upper changed_rows detection/spread works (8's in rows 4-5 left match), but lower point reflection misses some copies (e.g., row5 right has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2; row6 right has 3,3,2,2 matching but row7 right all 4's while expected also 4's? wait, row7 generated matches expected all 4's); add-3's logic applies but skips some right blocks (e.g., row18-20 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 matches expected, but row21 left has 2,3 instead of expected 2,3? minor, but row24 has 8,4 instead of all 4's, indicating over-spread of 8's); isolated 2 rule not triggering visibly; 8-block spread in lower right overextends (row24 has 8,8,8 while expected all 4's in that position, and row23 has 8,4 vs expected 4,4? wait, row23 expected all 4's pre-24).
 * In train1, exception clear not applying (row7 right cols18-21 should clear to 4's if pattern in row below changed, but generated has no 8's there anyway, so neutral); remove-3's in changed rows works (no 3's left in rows4-6 left).
 * In train2 (has-9), upper processing mostly matches (e.g., rows0-7,9-13 match expected, including 8/3 spreads and 9/2/1 placements), central row all 1's correct, but lower clear-then-place fails: unique patterns identified but doubling/shifting wrong (e.g., row20 left all 4's in generated but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1—suggests uniques placed but not doubled correctly or wrong order/shift; row23 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 matches but right has 1,1,2,2,9 instead of 4,4,3,8,4, indicating reflection applying to wrong targets or not skipping 4's); row24 left 4,4,9,9,... overplaces a pattern into what should be cleared 8,8,3,3; row25 left 4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3 matches expected but row26 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 same, but overall uniques seem to place 3 patterns (rows20-26 partially filled wrong).
 * Right reflection in has-9 applies but ignores bounds/shift (e.g., in train2 row23 right generated 1,1,2,2,9 from upper row3's left 3? but expected 3,8 from elsewhere? unknown why mismatch, possibly wrong target_col calc or applying to all non-4 without checking lower target==4).
 * Spread up right in upper works partially (train1 row3 right 8,8 matches), but in test generated, upper row2 right has 8,8 which may be over-spread.
 * No unhelpful functions; the inline block extraction is helpful but buggy in shift/placement (causes over/under-doubling in train2 lower left); the 8-spread down in no-9 lower breaks early correctly but initial reflection coords wrong (min_tc/max_tc from upper 8's point-reflected, but generated row24 8's where expected not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming has_nine=true due to 9's in upper) partially makes sense structurally (central col 1's correct, upper matches likely input transformations like 8/3/9/2/1 spreads in rows3-7,9-10; lower cleared to 4's/1's base, with some doubled-like patterns in rows20-26 left e.g., row25-26 has 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggesting partial unique doubling from upper row6-7's 9,2,2,1,1 but lengths not exactly doubled—9's are 4 in upper but 4 in lower left row25? wait, upper row5-6 has four 9's? input not shown but generated has four 9's left row5-6, so doubling to eight but placed as four? incomplete); right side reflections visible (e.g., row5-6 right 2,2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors left 2's/9's but shifted wrong, cols22-25 vs expected symmetric to left cols1-4? looks off by cols).
 * Does not look fully correct: Lower left placements irregular (row20 left all 4's but should place a unique if any; row21-22 left 4,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggests truncated doubling, missing full blocks; row23-24 left 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 but with extras like row25 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2 overlong, indicating wrong num_rows=1<<k assignment or shift causing overlap/out-of-bounds clipping); right lower has inconsistent mirrors (row20 right all 4's ok, but row25-26 right 3,3,8,8 vs left 2,2 not matching point-reflect of upper, and row23 right 2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors but expected more 8/3 from upper 8's?); upper row2 right 8,8 seems premature spread (if input has no triggering 4's below); overall, doubling logic fails to produce exact expected lengths/shifts, and reflections overwrite or miss, so likely incorrect—needs better unique selection (skip duplicates properly) and reflection bounds check (target_col >=14 and <=26).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:42:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a symmetry and propagation puzzle on a 27x27 grid centered at row/column 13, where patterns (using numbers 1-9, with 4 as background/empty) in the upper-left quadrant are detected, extended, reflected across the vertical and horizontal centers, and sometimes doubled or specially handled in the lower half based on the presence of 9's, creating mirrored or transformed structures while filling gaps and respecting sources like 2's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross of 1's (column 13 all 1's, row 13 all 1's), which acts as a divider and symmetry axis; nothing should overwrite this except possibly in reflections.
 * Upper-left (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) patterns start with "sources" like isolated or blocked 2's above gaps of 4's; these propagate downward as 8's into the gaps until hitting another non-4, but only if the gap is valid (all 4's between a 2 and another 2).
 * Reflections: Upper-left non-4 values (except skipped sources) mirror to upper-right (cols 14-26) via tc = 26 - c; point-wise reflections from upper-left to lower-right via tr = 26 - r, tc = 26 - c, but only if target is 4.
 * Extensions: Blocks of 2's in upper-right extend leftward into adjacent 4's as 3's (limited by non-4 or center); in lower half (rows 14+), 2's extend rightward/leftward similarly into 4's as 3's.
 * Gaps and 8's: After propagation, fill upper gaps with 8's; in lower-right, extend 8 blocks left by 1 if possible, and spread 8's downward iteratively based on max upper gap size.
 * 9-handling: If any 9 exists anywhere (often introduced in patterns), clear lower half to mostly 1's in center col and 4's elsewhere; extract unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns, double their non-4 sequences (centered/shifted), and place them in lower half in blocks of size 2^idx (reversed order from bottom), then reflect subsets of these blocks to right side, skipping 8's in some cases, with special prev-block reflections for idx >=2.
 * No-9 case (else branch): Handle lower half without clearing—extend 2's bidirectionally to 3's, propagate isolated lower-left 2's downward as 8's in same col if below is 4, reflect upper-left point-wise to lower-right, extend lower-right 8's left by 1, and spread 8's down by max upper gap iterations.
 * Subtleties: Skip reflecting source 8's from propagations; exception clearing in upper rows after changes (e.g., clear specific right positions if left has [2,2,3,3]); isolated 2's only propagate down if single and below is 4; doubling shifts non-4 content to center-start; patterns are tuples for uniqueness, ignoring all-4 rows; reflections only overwrite 4's; lower placements start from bottom (row 26) upward.
 * Easy misses: Propagation only triggers on 8 above 2 with all-4 gap (not just any 2); max_gap for downward spread is from upper propagations only; in 9-case, reflections are partial (e.g., offsets for inner blocks, only non-8 values); lower extensions stop at center (col 13); 1's in patterns (e.g., near 2's or 9's) must be preserved exactly in doublings/reflections.
 * All attempts assume input g is the initial upper-left pattern with rest 4's, but processing modifies in place; N=27 fixed, CENTER=13.

    # Useful for 9-case lower block creation: preserves block values/lengths but doubles them contiguously, centering the content.
    # Works well for simple patterns but may shift incorrectly if first_non4 is far left (start_col clamps to 0).

        length = j - i
        blocks.append((val, length))
        n_non4 += length
        i = j
    if not blocks:
        return [4] * center
    shift = n_non4 // 2
    start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift)
    new_row = [4] * center
    pos = start_col
    for val, length in blocks:
        for _ in range(2 * length):
            if pos < center:
                new_row[pos] = val
            pos += 1
    return new_row
```

No other functions in the attempt are notably helpful; the main program() is monolithic and error-prone.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Partially captured upper propagations (e.g., 8's in rows 4-5 cols 5-6 match, 2's and 3's in rows 6-7 cols 5-8 match), center cross correct, but failed lower half: introduced extra 8's in row 3 right (expected none), misplaced 3's/2's in rows 18-20 (expected starting later, no extras), added unneeded 8's in row 21 col 3 and row 22 cols 19-21 (expected 8 only in row 21 cols 19-20, row 22 none); no 9's so else branch used, but extensions/reflections over-applied or mistimed.
 * Training 1: Upper-right extensions partial (e.g., missed some 3's from 2's), exception clear didn't trigger correctly (no changed_rows max affecting rows 5:9 pattern check), point reflections added extras in lower-right without proper isolation checks.
 * Training 2: Has 9's, so if-branch triggered but botched lower placement: uniques extraction likely wrong (e.g., row 5-6 patterns with 9,2,2,1,1 doubled incorrectly, leading to row 20 [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] which has extra length/positions vs expected [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] but wait, similar—actually mismatch in row 21-22: generated has 1's in cols 17-18 where expected has none, and 9's shifted; row 23 has 3,8 misplaced).
 * Training 2: Reflections in 9-case incomplete (e.g., missed full offset mirroring for block i=1, or prev-block copy for i>=2, leading to sparse right side in lower rows like 23-24); upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8's and 3's in rows 4-5), but introduced bogus 1's in lower-left row 21.
 * Both: Propagation logic finds some (k,m,c) but skip_sources prevents over-reflection partially; downward spread in no-9 case under-applied (max_gap=0? leading to no 8's in lower); isolated 2's propagation missed in lower (e.g., train1 row 20 col3=2 should propagate? but expected doesn't); get_doubled_sequence used but uniques list or block sizing (1<<idx) off, causing wrong row counts/placements.
 * Function get_doubled_sequence is helpful for 9-doubling but buggy on shift if n_non4 odd or first_non4 misaligned (e.g., train2 row5 doubling puts 9's/2's/1's centered wrong).
 * Main program has no explicit object extraction (e.g., no function to find all 2-blocks or 9-locations), making debugging hard; unhelpful as it hardcodes ranges like 5:9 or 18:22 without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies with inferred rules from trainings (e.g., upper-left row3 has 8,8,3,3 but expected from similar train1/2 might propagate differently—no visible 8-source above it, suggesting invalid propagation; row5-6 have 9's in cols1-4 but doubling/reflection in lower rows 24-25 overextends 9's/2's without matching unique patterns, and row7-8 have 1's in cols5-6 which may be unintended 1-spillover since center is col13; lower-left rows20-26 mostly empty 4's but expected extensions/reflections from upper 2's/3's/8's/9's, e.g., row24 should have reflected 9's/2's from upper but has isolated 1's instead; no-9? but 9's present so if-branch should clear/repopulate lower but results in partial fills like row25 [9's,2's] mismatched length/position vs doubled uniques; overall, symmetry broken (e.g., upper-right row3 3,3,8,8 but lower-right sparse), and extra 8's in row27 left suggest over-extension—likely max_gap miscalc or reflection overwrite error.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 15:42:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 27x27 grid through symmetry operations (reflections across center lines and points), pattern spreading (e.g., propagating 8's downward/upward from pairs of 2's or 8's), conditional modifications (e.g., converting 3's to 4's or adding 3's adjacent to 2 blocks), and bifurcated lower-half rules depending on the presence of 9's, where the upper half influences the lower via copying, doubling, or clearing patterns while preserving a central column of 1's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has rotational/point symmetry around the center (row/column 13, 0-indexed), but reflections are conditional (e.g., only copy if the target position is 4, and left-to-right is horizontal flip in upper half, while lower uses point reflection or shifted mirroring).
 * Upper half always applies: Detect "changed_rows" (rows 1-12) where row r-1 has adjacent 8's in even-odd column pairs (0-1, 2-3, etc., up to <13) above adjacent 2's in row r; then horizontally reflect upper-left non-4's to upper-right only if right target is 4; spread 8's downward into those changed_rows' left pairs if conditions met; convert all 3's in changed_rows' left half to 4's; conditionally spread 8's upward in right half (rows 0-12, columns 14+ even-odd pairs) if below has 8's and current has 4's; exception for rows below max changed_row with specific left pattern (2,2,3,3 at cols 5-8) clears right cols 18-21 to 4's.
 * Lower half splits on has_nine: If no 9, use point reflection (r2=26-r, c2=26-c) from upper-left to lower-right (rows 14+, cols 14+) only if target is 4; extend 2-blocks in lower by adding 3's to adjacent 4's (left blocks extend right, right blocks extend left, only within halves); for isolated single 2's in lower-left (no adjacent 2's horizontally), set directly below (row+1, same col) from 4 to 8 if it's 4; reflect/spread upper-left 8-block to lower-right via point reflection, then extend leftward by one col if possible, and spread downward row-by-row for the block's height if entire target row segment is 4's.
 * If has_nine, clear lower (rows 14-26) to 4's everywhere except central col 13=1; identify unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns (rows 0-12, cols 0-12), place them doubled (group consecutive same non-4 values into blocks, double each block's length, shift start by half total non-4 count in original row, place sequentially from left in lower-left) starting from bottom (row 26) upward, with 1 row for first unique, 2 for second, 4 for third, etc. (2^k rows per unique pattern); then for each upper row with non-4's in left, mirror to lower-right (target_row=26-r, target_col=26-c) without shift if target in bounds (cols 14+).
 * Subtleties: Doubling in has_nine preserves block identities but concatenates doubled lengths into a new sequence, starts placement at shifted col (max(0, first_non4_col - shift)); uniqueness ignores all-4 rows and duplicates exact tuple patterns; spreads/stretches stop if not all 4's in target; central row 13 is always all 1's in output; use original grid 'g' for conditions (e.g., changed_rows detection) to avoid mid-process overwrites; column pairs are even-odd starting from 0; lower clears override prior upper influences; isolated 2 rule only for single cells, not blocks; 8-spread in no-9 lower is height-limited and breaks if any non-4 in target segment.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections don't overwrite non-4's (only set if target==4); adding 3's to 2-blocks only where 4's exist and within half-boundaries (no cross-center); in has_nine, right reflection is per upper row to specific lower row, but only non-4 left cells, and cols wrap to 26-c (which may land in left for some); changed_rows exception uses original g and specific cols 5-8 pattern to clear cols 18-21 only in affected rows; upper-right spread is upward (from lower to upper), unlike left downward spread; no modifications to central column except setting to 1's; patterns like 9's trigger full lower rebuild from uniques, ignoring point reflection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helper classes or functions are defined in the program; all logic is inline in `program()`. The block extraction for doubling (in has_nine lower placement) is a helpful inline snippet that groups consecutive same values:
```python
# Inside has_nine lower placement loop
blocks = []
i = 0
while i < CENTER:
    if row_data[i] == 4:
        i += 1
        continue
    col = row_data[i]  # Note: 'col' reused confusingly for value
    j = i
    while j < CENTER and row_data[j] == col:
        j += 1
    l = j - i
    blocks.append((col, l))
    i = j
# Then compute n_non4 = sum(l for _, l in blocks), shift = n_non4 // 2, etc.
```
This is useful for identifying runs of numbers to double, but could be extracted to a function like `def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:` for clarity. No other tools; copy.deepcopy is used correctly for grid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt, so no prior iterations, but it demonstrates partial grasp of upper-half reflection/spread (e.g., horizontal flip and 8-propagation mostly work in train1 upper, as rows 0-3,4 match expected) but fails in details like not adding 3's correctly to right-side 2-blocks in lower no-9 case.
 * In train1 (no-9), upper changed_rows detection/spread works (8's in rows 4-5 left match), but lower point reflection misses some copies (e.g., row5 right has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2; row6 right has 3,3,2,2 matching but row7 right all 4's while expected also 4's? wait, row7 generated matches expected all 4's); add-3's logic applies but skips some right blocks (e.g., row18-20 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 matches expected, but row21 left has 2,3 instead of expected 2,3? minor, but row24 has 8,4 instead of all 4's, indicating over-spread of 8's); isolated 2 rule not triggering visibly; 8-block spread in lower right overextends (row24 has 8,8,8 while expected all 4's in that position, and row23 has 8,4 vs expected 4,4? wait, row23 expected all 4's pre-24).
 * In train1, exception clear not applying (row7 right cols18-21 should clear to 4's if pattern in row below changed, but generated has no 8's there anyway, so neutral); remove-3's in changed rows works (no 3's left in rows4-6 left).
 * In train2 (has-9), upper processing mostly matches (e.g., rows0-7,9-13 match expected, including 8/3 spreads and 9/2/1 placements), central row all 1's correct, but lower clear-then-place fails: unique patterns identified but doubling/shifting wrong (e.g., row20 left all 4's in generated but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1—suggests uniques placed but not doubled correctly or wrong order/shift; row23 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 matches but right has 1,1,2,2,9 instead of 4,4,3,8,4, indicating reflection applying to wrong targets or not skipping 4's); row24 left 4,4,9,9,... overplaces a pattern into what should be cleared 8,8,3,3; row25 left 4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3 matches expected but row26 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 same, but overall uniques seem to place 3 patterns (rows20-26 partially filled wrong).
 * Right reflection in has-9 applies but ignores bounds/shift (e.g., in train2 row23 right generated 1,1,2,2,9 from upper row3's left 3? but expected 3,8 from elsewhere? unknown why mismatch, possibly wrong target_col calc or applying to all non-4 without checking lower target==4).
 * Spread up right in upper works partially (train1 row3 right 8,8 matches), but in test generated, upper row2 right has 8,8 which may be over-spread.
 * No unhelpful functions; the inline block extraction is helpful but buggy in shift/placement (causes over/under-doubling in train2 lower left); the 8-spread down in no-9 lower breaks early correctly but initial reflection coords wrong (min_tc/max_tc from upper 8's point-reflected, but generated row24 8's where expected not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming has_nine=true due to 9's in upper) partially makes sense structurally (central col 1's correct, upper matches likely input transformations like 8/3/9/2/1 spreads in rows3-7,9-10; lower cleared to 4's/1's base, with some doubled-like patterns in rows20-26 left e.g., row25-26 has 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggesting partial unique doubling from upper row6-7's 9,2,2,1,1 but lengths not exactly doubled—9's are 4 in upper but 4 in lower left row25? wait, upper row5-6 has four 9's? input not shown but generated has four 9's left row5-6, so doubling to eight but placed as four? incomplete); right side reflections visible (e.g., row5-6 right 2,2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors left 2's/9's but shifted wrong, cols22-25 vs expected symmetric to left cols1-4? looks off by cols).
 * Does not look fully correct: Lower left placements irregular (row20 left all 4's but should place a unique if any; row21-22 left 4,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggests truncated doubling, missing full blocks; row23-24 left 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 but with extras like row25 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2 overlong, indicating wrong num_rows=1<<k assignment or shift causing overlap/out-of-bounds clipping); right lower has inconsistent mirrors (row20 right all 4's ok, but row25-26 right 3,3,8,8 vs left 2,2 not matching point-reflect of upper, and row23 right 2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors but expected more 8/3 from upper 8's?); upper row2 right 8,8 seems premature spread (if input has no triggering 4's below); overall, doubling logic fails to produce exact expected lengths/shifts, and reflections overwrite or miss, so likely incorrect—needs better unique selection (skip duplicates properly) and reflection bounds check (target_col >=14 and <=26).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a symmetry and propagation puzzle on a 27x27 grid centered at row/column 13, where patterns (using numbers 1-9, with 4 as background/empty) in the upper-left quadrant are detected, extended, reflected across the vertical and horizontal centers, and sometimes doubled or specially handled in the lower half based on the presence of 9's, creating mirrored or transformed structures while filling gaps and respecting sources like 2's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross of 1's (column 13 all 1's, row 13 all 1's), which acts as a divider and symmetry axis; nothing should overwrite this except possibly in reflections.
 * Upper-left (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) patterns start with "sources" like isolated or blocked 2's above gaps of 4's; these propagate downward as 8's into the gaps until hitting another non-4, but only if the gap is valid (all 4's between a 2 and another 2).
 * Reflections: Upper-left non-4 values (except skipped sources) mirror to upper-right (cols 14-26) via tc = 26 - c; point-wise reflections from upper-left to lower-right via tr = 26 - r, tc = 26 - c, but only if target is 4.
 * Extensions: Blocks of 2's in upper-right extend leftward into adjacent 4's as 3's (limited by non-4 or center); in lower half (rows 14+), 2's extend rightward/leftward similarly into 4's as 3's.
 * Gaps and 8's: After propagation, fill upper gaps with 8's; in lower-right, extend 8 blocks left by 1 if possible, and spread 8's downward iteratively based on max upper gap size.
 * 9-handling: If any 9 exists anywhere (often introduced in patterns), clear lower half to mostly 1's in center col and 4's elsewhere; extract unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns, double their non-4 sequences (centered/shifted), and place them in lower half in blocks of size 2^idx (reversed order from bottom), then reflect subsets of these blocks to right side, skipping 8's in some cases, with special prev-block reflections for idx >=2.
 * No-9 case (else branch): Handle lower half without clearing—extend 2's bidirectionally to 3's, propagate isolated lower-left 2's downward as 8's in same col if below is 4, reflect upper-left point-wise to lower-right, extend lower-right 8's left by 1, and spread 8's down by max upper gap iterations.
 * Subtleties: Skip reflecting source 8's from propagations; exception clearing in upper rows after changes (e.g., clear specific right positions if left has [2,2,3,3]); isolated 2's only propagate down if single and below is 4; doubling shifts non-4 content to center-start; patterns are tuples for uniqueness, ignoring all-4 rows; reflections only overwrite 4's; lower placements start from bottom (row 26) upward.
 * Easy misses: Propagation only triggers on 8 above 2 with all-4 gap (not just any 2); max_gap for downward spread is from upper propagations only; in 9-case, reflections are partial (e.g., offsets for inner blocks, only non-8 values); lower extensions stop at center (col 13); 1's in patterns (e.g., near 2's or 9's) must be preserved exactly in doublings/reflections.
 * All attempts assume input g is the initial upper-left pattern with rest 4's, but processing modifies in place; N=27 fixed, CENTER=13.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-4 blocks from left-center, counts total non-4 length, shifts to center by half that length (floored), doubles each block's length, places in new row of 4's starting from adjusted pos.
    # Useful for 9-case lower block creation: preserves block values/lengths but doubles them contiguously, centering the content.
    # Works well for simple patterns but may shift incorrectly if first_non4 is far left (start_col clamps to 0).
    blocks = []
    first_non4 = -1
    n_non4 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < center:
        if row_data[i] == 4:
            i += 1
            continue
        if first_non4 == -1:
            first_non4 = i
        val = row_data[i]
        j = i
        while j < center and row_data[j] == val:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        blocks.append((val, length))
        n_non4 += length
        i = j
    if not blocks:
        return [4] * center
    shift = n_non4 // 2
    start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift)
    new_row = [4] * center
    pos = start_col
    for val, length in blocks:
        for _ in range(2 * length):
            if pos < center:
                new_row[pos] = val
            pos += 1
    return new_row
```

No other functions in the attempt are notably helpful; the main program() is monolithic and error-prone.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Partially captured upper propagations (e.g., 8's in rows 4-5 cols 5-6 match, 2's and 3's in rows 6-7 cols 5-8 match), center cross correct, but failed lower half: introduced extra 8's in row 3 right (expected none), misplaced 3's/2's in rows 18-20 (expected starting later, no extras), added unneeded 8's in row 21 col 3 and row 22 cols 19-21 (expected 8 only in row 21 cols 19-20, row 22 none); no 9's so else branch used, but extensions/reflections over-applied or mistimed.
 * Training 1: Upper-right extensions partial (e.g., missed some 3's from 2's), exception clear didn't trigger correctly (no changed_rows max affecting rows 5:9 pattern check), point reflections added extras in lower-right without proper isolation checks.
 * Training 2: Has 9's, so if-branch triggered but botched lower placement: uniques extraction likely wrong (e.g., row 5-6 patterns with 9,2,2,1,1 doubled incorrectly, leading to row 20 [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] which has extra length/positions vs expected [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] but wait, similar—actually mismatch in row 21-22: generated has 1's in cols 17-18 where expected has none, and 9's shifted; row 23 has 3,8 misplaced).
 * Training 2: Reflections in 9-case incomplete (e.g., missed full offset mirroring for block i=1, or prev-block copy for i>=2, leading to sparse right side in lower rows like 23-24); upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8's and 3's in rows 4-5), but introduced bogus 1's in lower-left row 21.
 * Both: Propagation logic finds some (k,m,c) but skip_sources prevents over-reflection partially; downward spread in no-9 case under-applied (max_gap=0? leading to no 8's in lower); isolated 2's propagation missed in lower (e.g., train1 row 20 col3=2 should propagate? but expected doesn't); get_doubled_sequence used but uniques list or block sizing (1<<idx) off, causing wrong row counts/placements.
 * Function get_doubled_sequence is helpful for 9-doubling but buggy on shift if n_non4 odd or first_non4 misaligned (e.g., train2 row5 doubling puts 9's/2's/1's centered wrong).
 * Main program has no explicit object extraction (e.g., no function to find all 2-blocks or 9-locations), making debugging hard; unhelpful as it hardcodes ranges like 5:9 or 18:22 without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies with inferred rules from trainings (e.g., upper-left row3 has 8,8,3,3 but expected from similar train1/2 might propagate differently—no visible 8-source above it, suggesting invalid propagation; row5-6 have 9's in cols1-4 but doubling/reflection in lower rows 24-25 overextends 9's/2's without matching unique patterns, and row7-8 have 1's in cols5-6 which may be unintended 1-spillover since center is col13; lower-left rows20-26 mostly empty 4's but expected extensions/reflections from upper 2's/3's/8's/9's, e.g., row24 should have reflected 9's/2's from upper but has isolated 1's instead; no-9? but 9's present so if-branch should clear/repopulate lower but results in partial fills like row25 [9's,2's] mismatched length/position vs doubled uniques; overall, symmetry broken (e.g., upper-right row3 3,3,8,8 but lower-right sparse), and extra 8's in row27 left suggest over-extension—likely max_gap miscalc or reflection overwrite error.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 15:55:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (indexed 0-26) where patterns of numbers (primarily 2,3,8,9, with 1 for the central cross and 4 as empty space) in the upper-left quadrant (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) are processed and propagated/reflected to the other quadrants via specific symmetry and extension rules, ultimately filling the grid while preserving a central cross of 1's at row 13 and column 13. The processing differs based on whether 9's are present, involving reflections, block doublings, spreads, and extensions, but the goal is a symmetric, rule-compliant output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has quadrants: upper-left (input patterns), upper-right (horizontal reflection of left), lower-left (vertical or point reflection), lower-right (combined reflections/extensions); central row/column 13 is always 1's, overriding other values.
 * Upper processing includes horizontal reflection across col 13, spreading 8's upward/rightward only under specific conditions (e.g., paired 8's above paired 2's with empty above), and clearing exceptions like [2,2,3,3] in left cols 5-8 if below is all 4's, setting symmetric right cols 18-21 to 4.
 * Lower processing branches: if no 9's, use point reflection (180-degree symmetry from upper-left to lower-right), isolated 2-to-8 conversions below, upward 2 extensions in right, horizontal 3 extensions from 2 blocks (leftward/rightward), leftward 8 extensions in right by 1, and downward 8 spreads; if 9's present, clear lower grid and rebuild by doubling unique upper row patterns (non-4 sequences), placing them bottom-up in lower-left with mirrored reflections in lower-right based on binary indexing (1<<k for uniqueness), partial/full placements, and extra filler rows.
 * Subtleties: Doubling sequences shifts non-4 blocks to center the doubled length; uniques are deduplicated by full row tuple but extracted as contiguous non-4 sequences for mirroring; iterative changes for extensions to propagate fully; avoid overwriting existing non-4's; central cross set last; 9-presence check is global (any 9 in grid post-upper processing).
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections are conditional (only set if target is 4); block lengths for extensions use exact runs of 2's/8's; in has_nine mode, placement uses reverse sequences for right mirrors, and binary j-loop creates layered/mirrored patterns per unique; num_non4_rows counts rows with any non-4 for placement height, but extras use last pattern without right mirror.
 * All attempts must handle empty/all-4 upper rows (default to all-4 or last pattern); preserve input non-4's unless explicitly cleared; ensure symmetry doesn't create overlaps or invalid spreads.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt's upper processing mostly works (e.g., correct reflections and 8-spreads in training 1, producing expected 8's in rows 3-5 cols 20-21), but clear_exception_upper fails in training 1 by not triggering (generated has [2,2,3,3] in row 6 cols 5-8 with below all-4's, but doesn't clear right cols 18-21, leaving unintended 2's/3's).
 * In training 1 (no 9's), lower_no_nine over-extends 3's horizontally (generated rows 14-18 have extra [3,3,3,2,2,2] in cols 16-21 instead of all-4's until row 18), and vertical 2-upward spread doesn't propagate fully (row 20 has [2,3] in cols 3-4 but expected cleaner); point reflection works partially but leaves artifacts.
 * In training 2 (has 9's), process_lower_has_nine clears correctly but uniques extraction and placement fail: generates extra duplicated patterns in lower-left (rows 19-22 have repeated [9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1] but shifted/misplaced), right mirrors are incomplete/partial wrongly (e.g., row 21 has partial [1,1,2,2,9] in cols 17-22 instead of full), and extra rows don't fill properly (row 23 has misplaced [1,1,2,2,9] without symmetry); binary j-loop (1<<k) for placements creates unintended layers.
 * get_doubled_sequence is helpful but buggy in shift calculation for non-contiguous blocks (in training 2, doubles [9,2,2,1,1] but centers poorly, leading to overflow/misplacement).
 * reflect_upper_horizontal and spread_8_up_right are mostly correct and essential for upper quadrant symmetry/spread.
 * process_lower_no_nine's iterative upward 2-extend and 8-down spread work in simple cases but over-extend 3's from 2-blocks (e.g., L=2 2's extend 2 3's right, but in training 1 it bleeds into existing areas); horizontal 3-extend logic is flawed in right-half (starts from i=26 downward but breaks on non-4).
 * clear_exception_upper is broken: condition checks g[r][5:9] == [2,2,3,3] but in training 1 row 6 it's [2,2,3,3] yet doesn't clear right (possibly due to below_all4 miscalc or range(13) limit); not triggering when expected.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of branching (9-detection) and basic reflections, but fails on precise block extensions, unique placement logic, and exception clearing; no functions for validating symmetry post-process.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: upper quadrant processing adds unintended 8's/3's (e.g., row 3 has [8,8,3,3] in cols 3-6 but input likely simpler; row 5-6 have [9,9,9,9,2,2] which spreads oddly to right as [2,2,2,9,9,9,9] without full mirror symmetry).
 * Lower half is malformed in has_nine mode (assuming 9's present): rows 14-20 are mostly empty/partial 1's (e.g., row 15 has [1,1,1,1] in cols 4-7 but expected patterned from doubled uniques), rows 21-23 have scattered [1,1] without full blocks, row 24 has [1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9] misplaced, row 25 has oversized [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2] (9 9's instead of matching upper sequence length), and row 26/27 incomplete; lacks proper binary-layered mirrors and extra row fillers.
 * Central cross is set correctly (all row/col 13=1), but overall asymmetry (e.g., lower-right doesn't reflect upper-left's 9/2/1 patterns properly) and overfills (e.g., row 27 has [4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3] unrelated to input) indicate broken unique extraction/placement; does not match expected clean, symmetric propagation.

[2025-10-01 15:55:53] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs/outputs (which represent complete example pairs) and test input (for consistency checking), below is a list of only the obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** provided image (train input 1, train output 1, train input 2, train output 2, test input 1) and demonstrate consistent effects or relationships across all of them. No high-level puzzle solving or total understanding is included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone single-block properties without impact on others) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., light blue, which is absent in train 1 pair; variable holes=1 in yellow, which is not always present) are not included. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact rules for how block positions or colors change from input to output) are noted as such rather than explained or forced.

1. **Colored rectangular blocks (maroon, green, red, blue) overlay on yellow quadrant backgrounds, reducing yellow pixel counts**:
   - Each block's pixels (area) directly subtract from the pixel count of the specific yellow quadrant it occupies.
   - Calculation is exact: yellow pixels = 169 - sum of block pixels within that quadrant's bbox.
   - Consistent effect: Blocks cover yellow without overlap between blocks; no block pixels affect multiple yellows or the blue cross.
   - Applies to all blocks in every image; total coverage per quadrant always sums to 169 - yellow pixels.

2. **Yellow quadrants are spatially contained by the fixed blue cross borders**:
   - Yellow bboxes are fixed ([0,0,12,12] top-left, [14,0,26,12] top-right, [0,14,12,26] bottom-left, [14,14,26,26] bottom-right) and do not overlap the blue cross bbox ([0,0,26,26]).
   - Blue cross pixels (always 53) remain unchanged and unaffected by blocks or yellow pixel variations.
   - Effect: This containment prevents blocks from crossing between quadrants, keeping all block bboxes strictly inside one yellow bbox in every image.

3. **Block geometry (bbox and pixels) self-consistently defines size without holes**:
   - Every block (maroon, green, red, blue) has holes=0, and pixels = (maxx - minx + 1) × (maxy - miny + 1).
   - No other elements (yellow or blue) affect this property; it is internal to blocks but consistently enables the overlay interaction with yellow (property 1).

4. **Position of blocks within quadrants affects yellow pixel reduction (spatial overlay interaction)**:
   - A block's bbox position determines which yellow it overlays (e.g., x 0-12 and y 0-12 → top-left yellow).
   - Consistent across all: No blocks extend outside their quadrant or into the blue cross, ensuring position directly ties to one yellow's pixel reduction.
   - Unknown: How positions transform between images (e.g., from train input to output); no consistent rule identifiable without forcing an explanation.

5. **Color of blocks (maroon, green, red, blue) ties to their overlay effect on yellow, independent of transformation**:
   - Each block's color does not alter the pixel subtraction mechanic (all colors reduce yellow equally by their pixels), but color is preserved as a property during overlay.
   - Consistent presence: These four colors appear in every image; their blocks always participate in yellow reduction.
   - Unknown: If or how color affects movement/relocation between images (e.g., color swapping or grouping); not consistently explainable across trains.

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., edges adjacency for L-shapes, holes effects, color-to-position causation, or silhouette transformations) are identifiable without speculation, as they vary or lack direct effects across all images. For example, potential block adjacencies (e.g., for composites) occur but do not consistently affect pixel counts, holes, or other properties in every case.

[2025-10-01 15:57:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (indexed 0-26) where patterns of numbers (primarily 2,3,8,9, with 1 for the central cross and 4 as empty space) in the upper-left quadrant (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) are processed and propagated/reflected to the other quadrants via specific symmetry and extension rules, ultimately filling the grid while preserving a central cross of 1's at row 13 and column 13. The processing differs based on whether 9's are present, involving reflections, block doublings, spreads, and extensions, but the goal is a symmetric, rule-compliant output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has quadrants: upper-left (input patterns), upper-right (horizontal reflection of left), lower-left (vertical or point reflection), lower-right (combined reflections/extensions); central row/column 13 is always 1's, overriding other values.
 * Upper processing includes horizontal reflection across col 13, spreading 8's upward/rightward only under specific conditions (e.g., paired 8's above paired 2's with empty above), and clearing exceptions like [2,2,3,3] in left cols 5-8 if below is all 4's, setting symmetric right cols 18-21 to 4.
 * Lower processing branches: if no 9's, use point reflection (180-degree symmetry from upper-left to lower-right), isolated 2-to-8 conversions below, upward 2 extensions in right, horizontal 3 extensions from 2 blocks (leftward/rightward), leftward 8 extensions in right by 1, and downward 8 spreads; if 9's present, clear lower grid and rebuild by doubling unique upper row patterns (non-4 sequences), placing them bottom-up in lower-left with mirrored reflections in lower-right based on binary indexing (1<<k for uniqueness), partial/full placements, and extra filler rows.
 * Subtleties: Doubling sequences shifts non-4 blocks to center the doubled length; uniques are deduplicated by full row tuple but extracted as contiguous non-4 sequences for mirroring; iterative changes for extensions to propagate fully; avoid overwriting existing non-4's; central cross set last; 9-presence check is global (any 9 in grid post-upper processing).
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections are conditional (only set if target is 4); block lengths for extensions use exact runs of 2's/8's; in has_nine mode, placement uses reverse sequences for right mirrors, and binary j-loop creates layered/mirrored patterns per unique; num_non4_rows counts rows with any non-4 for placement height, but extras use last pattern without right mirror.
 * All attempts must handle empty/all-4 upper rows (default to all-4 or last pattern); preserve input non-4's unless explicitly cleared; ensure symmetry doesn't create overlaps or invalid spreads.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-4 blocks from left-center, doubles their lengths centered via shift, fills rest with 4's.
    # Helpful for has_nine mode to create symmetric doubled patterns from unique rows.
    blocks = []
    first_non4 = -1
    n_non4 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < center:
        if row_data[i] == 4:
            i += 1
            continue
        if first_non4 == -1:
            first_non4 = i
        val = row_data[i]
        j = i
        while j < center and row_data[j] == val:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        blocks.append((val, length))
        n_non4 += length
        i = j
    if not blocks:
        return [4] * center
    shift = n_non4 // 2
    start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift)
    new_row = [4] * center
    pos = start_col
    for val, length in blocks:
        for _ in range(2 * length):
            if pos < center:
                new_row[pos] = val
            pos += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def extract_uniques(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[List[int], int, int, List[int], int]]:

    seen = set()
    uniques = []
    num_non4_rows = 0
    for r in range(13):
        row_data = g[r][:13]
        t = tuple(row_data)
        has_non4 = any(v != 4 for v in row_data)
        if has_non4:
            num_non4_rows += 1
        if has_non4 and t not in seen:
            non4_pos = [i for i in range(13) if row_data[i] != 4]
            min_c = min(non4_pos)
            max_c = max(non4_pos)
            seq = [row_data[i] for i in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
            rev_seq = seq[::-1]
            uniques.append((row_data, min_c, max_c, rev_seq, max_c - min_c + 1))
            seen.add(t)
    return uniques, num_non4_rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt's upper processing mostly works (e.g., correct reflections and 8-spreads in training 1, producing expected 8's in rows 3-5 cols 20-21), but clear_exception_upper fails in training 1 by not triggering (generated has [2,2,3,3] in row 6 cols 5-8 with below all-4's, but doesn't clear right cols 18-21, leaving unintended 2's/3's).
 * In training 1 (no 9's), lower_no_nine over-extends 3's horizontally (generated rows 14-18 have extra [3,3,3,2,2,2] in cols 16-21 instead of all-4's until row 18), and vertical 2-upward spread doesn't propagate fully (row 20 has [2,3] in cols 3-4 but expected cleaner); point reflection works partially but leaves artifacts.
 * In training 2 (has 9's), process_lower_has_nine clears correctly but uniques extraction and placement fail: generates extra duplicated patterns in lower-left (rows 19-22 have repeated [9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1] but shifted/misplaced), right mirrors are incomplete/partial wrongly (e.g., row 21 has partial [1,1,2,2,9] in cols 17-22 instead of full), and extra rows don't fill properly (row 23 has misplaced [1,1,2,2,9] without symmetry); binary j-loop (1<<k) for placements creates unintended layers.
 * get_doubled_sequence is helpful but buggy in shift calculation for non-contiguous blocks (in training 2, doubles [9,2,2,1,1] but centers poorly, leading to overflow/misplacement).
 * reflect_upper_horizontal and spread_8_up_right are mostly correct and essential for upper quadrant symmetry/spread.
 * process_lower_no_nine's iterative upward 2-extend and 8-down spread work in simple cases but over-extend 3's from 2-blocks (e.g., L=2 2's extend 2 3's right, but in training 1 it bleeds into existing areas); horizontal 3-extend logic is flawed in right-half (starts from i=26 downward but breaks on non-4).
 * clear_exception_upper is broken: condition checks g[r][5:9] == [2,2,3,3] but in training 1 row 6 it's [2,2,3,3] yet doesn't clear right (possibly due to below_all4 miscalc or range(13) limit); not triggering when expected.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of branching (9-detection) and basic reflections, but fails on precise block extensions, unique placement logic, and exception clearing; no functions for validating symmetry post-process.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: upper quadrant processing adds unintended 8's/3's (e.g., row 3 has [8,8,3,3] in cols 3-6 but input likely simpler; row 5-6 have [9,9,9,9,2,2] which spreads oddly to right as [2,2,2,9,9,9,9] without full mirror symmetry).
 * Lower half is malformed in has_nine mode (assuming 9's present): rows 14-20 are mostly empty/partial 1's (e.g., row 15 has [1,1,1,1] in cols 4-7 but expected patterned from doubled uniques), rows 21-23 have scattered [1,1] without full blocks, row 24 has [1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9] misplaced, row 25 has oversized [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2] (9 9's instead of matching upper sequence length), and row 26/27 incomplete; lacks proper binary-layered mirrors and extra row fillers.
 * Central cross is set correctly (all row/col 13=1), but overall asymmetry (e.g., lower-right doesn't reflect upper-left's 9/2/1 patterns properly) and overfills (e.g., row 27 has [4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3] unrelated to input) indicate broken unique extraction/placement; does not match expected clean, symmetric propagation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 27x27 grid through symmetry operations (reflections across center lines and points), pattern spreading (e.g., propagating 8's downward/upward from pairs of 2's or 8's), conditional modifications (e.g., converting 3's to 4's or adding 3's adjacent to 2 blocks), and bifurcated lower-half rules depending on the presence of 9's, where the upper half influences the lower via copying, doubling, or clearing patterns while preserving a central column of 1's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has rotational/point symmetry around the center (row/column 13, 0-indexed), but reflections are conditional (e.g., only copy if the target position is 4, and left-to-right is horizontal flip in upper half, while lower uses point reflection or shifted mirroring).
 * Upper half always applies: Detect "changed_rows" (rows 1-12) where row r-1 has adjacent 8's in even-odd column pairs (0-1, 2-3, etc., up to <13) above adjacent 2's in row r; then horizontally reflect upper-left non-4's to upper-right only if right target is 4; spread 8's downward into those changed_rows' left pairs if conditions met; convert all 3's in changed_rows' left half to 4's; conditionally spread 8's upward in right half (rows 0-12, columns 14+ even-odd pairs) if below has 8's and current has 4's; exception for rows below max changed_row with specific left pattern (2,2,3,3 at cols 5-8) clears right cols 18-21 to 4's.
 * Lower half splits on has_nine: If no 9, use point reflection (r2=26-r, c2=26-c) from upper-left to lower-right (rows 14+, cols 14+) only if target is 4; extend 2-blocks in lower by adding 3's to adjacent 4's (left blocks extend right, right blocks extend left, only within halves); for isolated single 2's in lower-left (no adjacent 2's horizontally), set directly below (row+1, same col) from 4 to 8 if it's 4; reflect/spread upper-left 8-block to lower-right via point reflection, then extend leftward by one col if possible, and spread downward row-by-row for the block's height if entire target row segment is 4's.
 * If has_nine, clear lower (rows 14-26) to 4's everywhere except central col 13=1; identify unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns (rows 0-12, cols 0-12), place them doubled (group consecutive same non-4 values into blocks, double each block's length, shift start by half total non-4 count in original row, place sequentially from left in lower-left) starting from bottom (row 26) upward, with 1 row for first unique, 2 for second, 4 for third, etc. (2^k rows per unique pattern); then for each upper row with non-4's in left, mirror to lower-right (target_row=26-r, target_col=26-c) without shift if target in bounds (cols 14+).
 * Subtleties: Doubling in has_nine preserves block identities but concatenates doubled lengths into a new sequence, starts placement at shifted col (max(0, first_non4_col - shift)); uniqueness ignores all-4 rows and duplicates exact tuple patterns; spreads/stretches stop if not all 4's in target; central row 13 is always all 1's in output; use original grid 'g' for conditions (e.g., changed_rows detection) to avoid mid-process overwrites; column pairs are even-odd starting from 0; lower clears override prior upper influences; isolated 2 rule only for single cells, not blocks; 8-spread in no-9 lower is height-limited and breaks if any non-4 in target segment.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections don't overwrite non-4's (only set if target==4); adding 3's to 2-blocks only where 4's exist and within half-boundaries (no cross-center); in has_nine, right reflection is per upper row to specific lower row, but only non-4 left cells, and cols wrap to 26-c (which may land in left for some); changed_rows exception uses original g and specific cols 5-8 pattern to clear cols 18-21 only in affected rows; upper-right spread is upward (from lower to upper), unlike left downward spread; no modifications to central column except setting to 1's; patterns like 9's trigger full lower rebuild from uniques, ignoring point reflection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helper classes or functions are defined in the program; all logic is inline in `program()`. The block extraction for doubling (in has_nine lower placement) is a helpful inline snippet that groups consecutive same values:
```python
# Inside has_nine lower placement loop
blocks = []
i = 0
while i < CENTER:
    if row_data[i] == 4:
        i += 1
        continue
    col = row_data[i]  # Note: 'col' reused confusingly for value
    j = i
    while j < CENTER and row_data[j] == col:
        j += 1
    l = j - i
    blocks.append((col, l))
    i = j
# Then compute n_non4 = sum(l for _, l in blocks), shift = n_non4 // 2, etc.
```
This is useful for identifying runs of numbers to double, but could be extracted to a function like `def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:` for clarity. No other tools; copy.deepcopy is used correctly for grid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt, so no prior iterations, but it demonstrates partial grasp of upper-half reflection/spread (e.g., horizontal flip and 8-propagation mostly work in train1 upper, as rows 0-3,4 match expected) but fails in details like not adding 3's correctly to right-side 2-blocks in lower no-9 case.
 * In train1 (no-9), upper changed_rows detection/spread works (8's in rows 4-5 left match), but lower point reflection misses some copies (e.g., row5 right has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2; row6 right has 3,3,2,2 matching but row7 right all 4's while expected also 4's? wait, row7 generated matches expected all 4's); add-3's logic applies but skips some right blocks (e.g., row18-20 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 matches expected, but row21 left has 2,3 instead of expected 2,3? minor, but row24 has 8,4 instead of all 4's, indicating over-spread of 8's); isolated 2 rule not triggering visibly; 8-block spread in lower right overextends (row24 has 8,8,8 while expected all 4's in that position, and row23 has 8,4 vs expected 4,4? wait, row23 expected all 4's pre-24).
 * In train1, exception clear not applying (row7 right cols18-21 should clear to 4's if pattern in row below changed, but generated has no 8's there anyway, so neutral); remove-3's in changed rows works (no 3's left in rows4-6 left).
 * In train2 (has-9), upper processing mostly matches (e.g., rows0-7,9-13 match expected, including 8/3 spreads and 9/2/1 placements), central row all 1's correct, but lower clear-then-place fails: unique patterns identified but doubling/shifting wrong (e.g., row20 left all 4's in generated but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1—suggests uniques placed but not doubled correctly or wrong order/shift; row23 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 matches but right has 1,1,2,2,9 instead of 4,4,3,8,4, indicating reflection applying to wrong targets or not skipping 4's); row24 left 4,4,9,9,... overplaces a pattern into what should be cleared 8,8,3,3; row25 left 4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3 matches expected but row26 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 same, but overall uniques seem to place 3 patterns (rows20-26 partially filled wrong).
 * Right reflection in has-9 applies but ignores bounds/shift (e.g., in train2 row23 right generated 1,1,2,2,9 from upper row3's left 3? but expected 3,8 from elsewhere? unknown why mismatch, possibly wrong target_col calc or applying to all non-4 without checking lower target==4).
 * Spread up right in upper works partially (train1 row3 right 8,8 matches), but in test generated, upper row2 right has 8,8 which may be over-spread.
 * No unhelpful functions; the inline block extraction is helpful but buggy in shift/placement (causes over/under-doubling in train2 lower left); the 8-spread down in no-9 lower breaks early correctly but initial reflection coords wrong (min_tc/max_tc from upper 8's point-reflected, but generated row24 8's where expected not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming has_nine=true due to 9's in upper) partially makes sense structurally (central col 1's correct, upper matches likely input transformations like 8/3/9/2/1 spreads in rows3-7,9-10; lower cleared to 4's/1's base, with some doubled-like patterns in rows20-26 left e.g., row25-26 has 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggesting partial unique doubling from upper row6-7's 9,2,2,1,1 but lengths not exactly doubled—9's are 4 in upper but 4 in lower left row25? wait, upper row5-6 has four 9's? input not shown but generated has four 9's left row5-6, so doubling to eight but placed as four? incomplete); right side reflections visible (e.g., row5-6 right 2,2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors left 2's/9's but shifted wrong, cols22-25 vs expected symmetric to left cols1-4? looks off by cols).
 * Does not look fully correct: Lower left placements irregular (row20 left all 4's but should place a unique if any; row21-22 left 4,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggests truncated doubling, missing full blocks; row23-24 left 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 but with extras like row25 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2 overlong, indicating wrong num_rows=1<<k assignment or shift causing overlap/out-of-bounds clipping); right lower has inconsistent mirrors (row20 right all 4's ok, but row25-26 right 3,3,8,8 vs left 2,2 not matching point-reflect of upper, and row23 right 2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors but expected more 8/3 from upper 8's?); upper row2 right 8,8 seems premature spread (if input has no triggering 4's below); overall, doubling logic fails to produce exact expected lengths/shifts, and reflections overwrite or miss, so likely incorrect—needs better unique selection (skip duplicates properly) and reflection bounds check (target_col >=14 and <=26).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a symmetry and propagation puzzle on a 27x27 grid centered at row/column 13, where patterns (using numbers 1-9, with 4 as background/empty) in the upper-left quadrant are detected, extended, reflected across the vertical and horizontal centers, and sometimes doubled or specially handled in the lower half based on the presence of 9's, creating mirrored or transformed structures while filling gaps and respecting sources like 2's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross of 1's (column 13 all 1's, row 13 all 1's), which acts as a divider and symmetry axis; nothing should overwrite this except possibly in reflections.
 * Upper-left (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) patterns start with "sources" like isolated or blocked 2's above gaps of 4's; these propagate downward as 8's into the gaps until hitting another non-4, but only if the gap is valid (all 4's between a 2 and another 2).
 * Reflections: Upper-left non-4 values (except skipped sources) mirror to upper-right (cols 14-26) via tc = 26 - c; point-wise reflections from upper-left to lower-right via tr = 26 - r, tc = 26 - c, but only if target is 4.
 * Extensions: Blocks of 2's in upper-right extend leftward into adjacent 4's as 3's (limited by non-4 or center); in lower half (rows 14+), 2's extend rightward/leftward similarly into 4's as 3's.
 * Gaps and 8's: After propagation, fill upper gaps with 8's; in lower-right, extend 8 blocks left by 1 if possible, and spread 8's downward iteratively based on max upper gap size.
 * 9-handling: If any 9 exists anywhere (often introduced in patterns), clear lower half to mostly 1's in center col and 4's elsewhere; extract unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns, double their non-4 sequences (centered/shifted), and place them in lower half in blocks of size 2^idx (reversed order from bottom), then reflect subsets of these blocks to right side, skipping 8's in some cases, with special prev-block reflections for idx >=2.
 * No-9 case (else branch): Handle lower half without clearing—extend 2's bidirectionally to 3's, propagate isolated lower-left 2's downward as 8's in same col if below is 4, reflect upper-left point-wise to lower-right, extend lower-right 8's left by 1, and spread 8's down by max upper gap iterations.
 * Subtleties: Skip reflecting source 8's from propagations; exception clearing in upper rows after changes (e.g., clear specific right positions if left has [2,2,3,3]); isolated 2's only propagate down if single and below is 4; doubling shifts non-4 content to center-start; patterns are tuples for uniqueness, ignoring all-4 rows; reflections only overwrite 4's; lower placements start from bottom (row 26) upward.
 * Easy misses: Propagation only triggers on 8 above 2 with all-4 gap (not just any 2); max_gap for downward spread is from upper propagations only; in 9-case, reflections are partial (e.g., offsets for inner blocks, only non-8 values); lower extensions stop at center (col 13); 1's in patterns (e.g., near 2's or 9's) must be preserved exactly in doublings/reflections.
 * All attempts assume input g is the initial upper-left pattern with rest 4's, but processing modifies in place; N=27 fixed, CENTER=13.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-4 blocks from left-center, counts total non-4 length, shifts to center by half that length (floored), doubles each block's length, places in new row of 4's starting from adjusted pos.
    # Useful for 9-case lower block creation: preserves block values/lengths but doubles them contiguously, centering the content.
    # Works well for simple patterns but may shift incorrectly if first_non4 is far left (start_col clamps to 0).
    blocks = []
    first_non4 = -1
    n_non4 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < center:
        if row_data[i] == 4:
            i += 1
            continue
        if first_non4 == -1:
            first_non4 = i
        val = row_data[i]
        j = i
        while j < center and row_data[j] == val:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        blocks.append((val, length))
        n_non4 += length
        i = j
    if not blocks:
        return [4] * center
    shift = n_non4 // 2
    start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift)
    new_row = [4] * center
    pos = start_col
    for val, length in blocks:
        for _ in range(2 * length):
            if pos < center:
                new_row[pos] = val
            pos += 1
    return new_row
```

No other functions in the attempt are notably helpful; the main program() is monolithic and error-prone.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Partially captured upper propagations (e.g., 8's in rows 4-5 cols 5-6 match, 2's and 3's in rows 6-7 cols 5-8 match), center cross correct, but failed lower half: introduced extra 8's in row 3 right (expected none), misplaced 3's/2's in rows 18-20 (expected starting later, no extras), added unneeded 8's in row 21 col 3 and row 22 cols 19-21 (expected 8 only in row 21 cols 19-20, row 22 none); no 9's so else branch used, but extensions/reflections over-applied or mistimed.
 * Training 1: Upper-right extensions partial (e.g., missed some 3's from 2's), exception clear didn't trigger correctly (no changed_rows max affecting rows 5:9 pattern check), point reflections added extras in lower-right without proper isolation checks.
 * Training 2: Has 9's, so if-branch triggered but botched lower placement: uniques extraction likely wrong (e.g., row 5-6 patterns with 9,2,2,1,1 doubled incorrectly, leading to row 20 [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] which has extra length/positions vs expected [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] but wait, similar—actually mismatch in row 21-22: generated has 1's in cols 17-18 where expected has none, and 9's shifted; row 23 has 3,8 misplaced).
 * Training 2: Reflections in 9-case incomplete (e.g., missed full offset mirroring for block i=1, or prev-block copy for i>=2, leading to sparse right side in lower rows like 23-24); upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8's and 3's in rows 4-5), but introduced bogus 1's in lower-left row 21.
 * Both: Propagation logic finds some (k,m,c) but skip_sources prevents over-reflection partially; downward spread in no-9 case under-applied (max_gap=0? leading to no 8's in lower); isolated 2's propagation missed in lower (e.g., train1 row 20 col3=2 should propagate? but expected doesn't); get_doubled_sequence used but uniques list or block sizing (1<<idx) off, causing wrong row counts/placements.
 * Function get_doubled_sequence is helpful for 9-doubling but buggy on shift if n_non4 odd or first_non4 misaligned (e.g., train2 row5 doubling puts 9's/2's/1's centered wrong).
 * Main program has no explicit object extraction (e.g., no function to find all 2-blocks or 9-locations), making debugging hard; unhelpful as it hardcodes ranges like 5:9 or 18:22 without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies with inferred rules from trainings (e.g., upper-left row3 has 8,8,3,3 but expected from similar train1/2 might propagate differently—no visible 8-source above it, suggesting invalid propagation; row5-6 have 9's in cols1-4 but doubling/reflection in lower rows 24-25 overextends 9's/2's without matching unique patterns, and row7-8 have 1's in cols5-6 which may be unintended 1-spillover since center is col13; lower-left rows20-26 mostly empty 4's but expected extensions/reflections from upper 2's/3's/8's/9's, e.g., row24 should have reflected 9's/2's from upper but has isolated 1's instead; no-9? but 9's present so if-branch should clear/repopulate lower but results in partial fills like row25 [9's,2's] mismatched length/position vs doubled uniques; overall, symmetry broken (e.g., upper-right row3 3,3,8,8 but lower-right sparse), and extra 8's in row27 left suggest over-extension—likely max_gap miscalc or reflection overwrite error.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs/outputs (which represent complete example pairs) and test input (for consistency checking), below is a list of only the obvious, direct interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** provided image (train input 1, train output 1, train input 2, train output 2, test input 1) and demonstrate consistent effects or relationships across all of them. No high-level puzzle solving or total understanding is included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone single-block properties without impact on others) are excluded. Non-consistent elements (e.g., light blue, which is absent in train 1 pair; variable holes=1 in yellow, which is not always present) are not included. Unknown transformations (e.g., exact rules for how block positions or colors change from input to output) are noted as such rather than explained or forced.

1. **Colored rectangular blocks (maroon, green, red, blue) overlay on yellow quadrant backgrounds, reducing yellow pixel counts**:
   - Each block's pixels (area) directly subtract from the pixel count of the specific yellow quadrant it occupies.
   - Calculation is exact: yellow pixels = 169 - sum of block pixels within that quadrant's bbox.
   - Consistent effect: Blocks cover yellow without overlap between blocks; no block pixels affect multiple yellows or the blue cross.
   - Applies to all blocks in every image; total coverage per quadrant always sums to 169 - yellow pixels.

2. **Yellow quadrants are spatially contained by the fixed blue cross borders**:
   - Yellow bboxes are fixed ([0,0,12,12] top-left, [14,0,26,12] top-right, [0,14,12,26] bottom-left, [14,14,26,26] bottom-right) and do not overlap the blue cross bbox ([0,0,26,26]).
   - Blue cross pixels (always 53) remain unchanged and unaffected by blocks or yellow pixel variations.
   - Effect: This containment prevents blocks from crossing between quadrants, keeping all block bboxes strictly inside one yellow bbox in every image.

3. **Block geometry (bbox and pixels) self-consistently defines size without holes**:
   - Every block (maroon, green, red, blue) has holes=0, and pixels = (maxx - minx + 1) × (maxy - miny + 1).
   - No other elements (yellow or blue) affect this property; it is internal to blocks but consistently enables the overlay interaction with yellow (property 1).

4. **Position of blocks within quadrants affects yellow pixel reduction (spatial overlay interaction)**:
   - A block's bbox position determines which yellow it overlays (e.g., x 0-12 and y 0-12 → top-left yellow).
   - Consistent across all: No blocks extend outside their quadrant or into the blue cross, ensuring position directly ties to one yellow's pixel reduction.
   - Unknown: How positions transform between images (e.g., from train input to output); no consistent rule identifiable without forcing an explanation.

5. **Color of blocks (maroon, green, red, blue) ties to their overlay effect on yellow, independent of transformation**:
   - Each block's color does not alter the pixel subtraction mechanic (all colors reduce yellow equally by their pixels), but color is preserved as a property during overlay.
   - Consistent presence: These four colors appear in every image; their blocks always participate in yellow reduction.
   - Unknown: If or how color affects movement/relocation between images (e.g., color swapping or grouping); not consistently explainable across trains.

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., edges adjacency for L-shapes, holes effects, color-to-position causation, or silhouette transformations) are identifiable without speculation, as they vary or lack direct effects across all images. For example, potential block adjacencies (e.g., for composites) occur but do not consistently affect pixel counts, holes, or other properties in every case.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 16:17:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (N=27, center at 13) where cells contain integers (1-9, with 4 likely representing empty/blank space), and the goal is to transform an input grid by applying symmetry rules (reflections, extensions), pattern spreading (for 8s and 3s from 2s), central cross filling with 1s, and special handling for the lower half based on presence of 9s (using unique row sequences that are doubled and mirrored) or absence (extending patterns downward with height matching and adjustments). The output is a completed grid that mirrors and extends upper patterns into the lower half while preserving or generating specific motifs like pairs of 2s/3s, 8s, and 9s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Central cross: Always set column 13 to 1s across all rows, and row 13 to all 1s— this is foundational and supersedes other rules.
 * Upper half processing (rows 0-12): Apply horizontal reflection (mirror left to right across center), but only fill if target is 4; spread 8s upward in upper-right if below has adjacent 8s and above is blank; extend 3s leftward from right-side 2-runs in upper rows if target is blank; handle exceptions like clearing specific [2,2,3,3] patterns in columns 5-8 if below is all 4s, by blanking columns 18-21.
 * Lower half processing (rows 14-26): Diverges based on presence of 9 anywhere in grid—if 9s exist, clear lower to central 1s, extract unique non-4 rows from upper (considering only first 13 cols, ignoring duplicates), double their non-4 sequences centered/shifted, place them bottom-up with 2^idx rows per unique, and mirror reversed sequences rightward for even/odd idx with specific top/bottom conditions; if no 9s, clear lower left to 4s, extend 2-runs rightward to 3s in left, leftward from right 2s, match total height of upper 2s (double it), iteratively extend upward from lower 2/3 segments if above is blank, reflect upper non-4s to lower-right if conditions met (e.g., 8s from changed rows), spread 8s left/downward if adjacent blanks, clear 3-runs adjacent to 8s, restore special saved rows, and add isolated 8s below single 2s.
 * Subtleties: Non-4 sequences are contiguous (min_c to max_c); doubling shifts by half non-4 length, starting from first non-4 pos; reflections are point-symmetric (row r, col c to 26-r, 26-c); 8-spreading is conditional on pairs and blanks; 3-extensions stop at center/14 boundaries; height matching for no-9 case uses max upper 2-height *2, extends iteratively up to that; special rows (reflections of changed upper pairs) are saved/restored before final extensions; 9-handling uses binary row counts (1<<idx) and idx-based mirroring logic (even/odd, top/bottom placement); all changes only overwrite 4s; grid is symmetric but upper drives lower.
 * Easy-to-miss: extract_uniques only considers rows 0-12, first 13 cols, and unique tuples with non-4 present; doubled_sequence skips 4s in count/shift but fills from start_col; no-9 lower has complex upward extension loop that counts iterations and segments including adjacent 3s; final 8-spreading in lower extends left and down separately; clearing 3s next to 8s only if directly adjacent rightward; isolated 2s in restored rows can seed downward 8s.
 * General: Grid is copied deeply; processes upper first, then lower; assumes input has patterns in upper/left, blanks elsewhere; outputs must match expected exactly, including no overfills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    # Extracts non-4 blocks from left of center, counts total non-4 length, shifts start by half that, doubles each block's length in new row (filling blanks).
    # Helpful for 9-case lower filling: creates mirrored/doubled patterns from unique upper rows.
    # Subtlety: If no blocks, returns all 4s; shift = n_non4 // 2, start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift); pos can exceed center but clips.

*The main program function integrates these but is overly complex/buggy; the above helpers are solid for pattern extraction/doubling but need correct integration. No types defined beyond lists/tuples.*

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (the "last submission"); both training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of lower-half rules.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 3,3,2,2 in lower rows 17-19 (cols 18-23) and misplaced 8s (e.g., row 20 has 8 at col 3 instead of 4s; row 24 has isolated 4s where 8s expected); also row 21 has 8,4 instead of 4,8 pattern—mismatches suggest over-extension of 3s from 2s or failed reflection/spread; upper matches expected mostly, but exception clear didn't fully blank cols 18-21 in row 6; no-9 path taken correctly but height/extension logic buggy (max_2_height likely miscomputed, leading to incomplete downward 8-spread).
 * Train 2: Generated mismatches in lower rows, e.g., row 20 all 4s but expected 9s/2s/1s; row 23 has 4,4,3,8 instead of 4,3,8,4 (misplaced 3); row 24 has extra 3,3 vs expected 8,8,3,3; row 26 has 4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,3,3 but prior rows wrong—suggests 9-present path taken but doubling/mirroring logic flawed (e.g., wrong which_u selection for even/odd idx, or rev_seq placement start_col=26-max_c-1 off); upper has stray 1s/9s not in expected.
 * extract_uniques and get_doubled_sequence are helpful/essential for 9-case but underused/buggy in integration (e.g., placement conditions like is_even_k, is_top/is_bottom not triggering correctly, leading to missing or extra placements).
 * No-9 path has issues: saved_special restoration conflicts with extensions; upward extension loop (while changed and < additional_up) over- or under-extends (e.g., doesn't fully match target_h= max_2_height*2); 8-spreading left/down misses conditions (e.g., doesn't extend left fully in train 1 row 20).
 * Exception clear in upper works partially but doesn't propagate to lower mirrors.
 * Overall: Core symmetries (central 1s, upper reflection) work; 8-spread upward ok; but lower divergence (9 vs no-9), height matching, iterative extensions, and placement logic (idx-based rows, rev_seq mirroring) are broken—leads to overfills/misplacements; program too long/complex, with redundant loops (e.g., multiple 2/3/8 scans per row).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies like upper row 2 with 8,8 in cols 22-23 (unexpected, as input likely lacks triggering pair above); row 5/6 with 9s in cols 1-4 and 23-26 but asymmetric (left 4,9,9,9,9 vs right 9,9,9,9,4—mismatches expected symmetry); rows 7-8 have 1,1 in cols 5-6 and 20-21 but expected might be blanks or extended; lower rows 20-21 have 1,1 in cols 4-7 and partial in 19-20 (incomplete mirroring); row 23 has 1,1,1,1 in cols 4-7 but right has 1,1 in 19-20 (asymmetric); row 24 has 2,2,9s rightward but left 1s (suggests flawed doubling/rev_seq placement); row 25 has full 9s left and 3,3,8,8 right (over-extension or wrong which_u); row 26 has 8s/3s but sparse—overall, 9s trigger path but mirroring/doubling shifts wrong (e.g., start_col misaligned, num_rows=1<<idx over/under-places), and no-9 elements like 8-spreads leak in; doesn't match expected clean symmetry (mentally, test input seems 9-present with upper 8/3/2/9/1 patterns needing precise bottom-up doubling + right rev-seq for 3-4 uniques, but output has extras/misses like unpaired 9s and incomplete 8s downward).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-01 16:17:32] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only those components, properties, and interactions that are obvious, directly observable, and consistent across **both** train examples (input 1/output 1 and input 2/output 2). I focused solely on elements with clear, repeated connections or effects (e.g., one property causing transformation in another, or components influencing each other's position/color/size). Irrelevant or static elements without dynamic interaction (e.g., isolated pixels not affecting others) are excluded. Interactions that vary (e.g., inconsistent color changes or y-shifts) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing a pattern. No high-level puzzle solution or test input analysis is included, as instructed.

#### 1. **Blue Grid Lines (Fixed Component)**
   - **Properties**: Color=Blue, holes=0, bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53 (unchanged in every input/output).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Provides fixed positional reference for all other components (e.g., all small blocks and yellow quadrants are placed relative to its vertical/horizontal lines at x=13 and y=13, dividing into quadrants).
     - No dynamic transformation, but consistently affects placement: All small rectangular blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue) are confined within or adjacent to quadrants defined by it, without crossing lines.
     - Consistent effect on yellow backgrounds: Grid overlaps yellow areas, contributing to their base pixel counts (yellow pixels decrease predictably when small blocks overlap within quadrants).

#### 2. **Top-Left Small Rectangular Blocks → Top-Right Duplication (Position → Position/Color/Size Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small blocks (colors: Maroon, Green, Light Blue, Blue, Red; all holes=0, rectangular bboxes, pixels=1–4) located in top-left quadrant (x1/x2 ≤12, y1/y2 ≤12).
   - **Properties Affected**: Position (x-mirrored), color (preserved), size (pixels preserved), shape (bbox dimensions preserved in x, approximate in y).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Consistent across both trains: Each top-left small block causes a new block of **same color** and **same pixels** to appear in top-right quadrant (x1/x2 ≥14, y1/y2 ≤12).
     - Specific transformation: x-position mirrored via x1' = 26 - x2, x2' = 26 - x1 (exact in both trains, e.g., train2 Blue [7,5,8,6] → [18,5,19,6]; train1 Green [7,6,8,7] → x=[18,?,19,?]).
     - y-position: Approximately preserved (similar y-range), but exact rule unknown (no shift in train2; consistent up-shift by 1 unit in train1 for added blocks—cannot explain without speculation).
     - If a target position already has a block (e.g., existing Red [20,5,21,6] p=4 in both trains), no new block is added there, but the interaction still applies to other top-left blocks.
     - No effect on holes (remains 0) or non-top-left blocks.
     - Consistent exclusion: Does not apply to bottom or yellow components directly.

#### 3. **Small Rectangular Blocks → Yellow Backgrounds (Position/Overlap → Pixel Count/Holes Adjustment)**
   - **Components Involved**: All small blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue; holes=0) and yellow quadrant backgrounds (color=Yellow, large bboxes covering [0,0,12,12], [14,0,26,12], [0,14,12,26], [14,14,26,26]).
   - **Properties Affected**: Yellow pixels (decreased), yellow holes (may change from 1 to 0).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Consistent across both trains: Placement of any small block within a yellow quadrant reduces that quadrant's pixel count by exactly the block's pixel value (e.g., train1: added Green p=4 reduces adjacent yellow by ~4; train2: multiple additions reduce bottom-left yellow from 153 to 117, matching total overlap area).
     - Overlap rule: Direct subtraction based on shared bbox area; no effect if no overlap.
     - Holes interaction: Yellow starts with holes=1 in all inputs; small blocks can cause holes=0 in outputs if coverage is sufficient (consistent in train2 bottom-left; not triggered in train1—exact threshold unknown).
     - Bidirectional: Yellows do not transform small blocks, but their pixel/hole changes are a direct effect of small block positions.
     - Consistent across all four quadrants, but most pronounced in top (due to duplications) and bottom (due to additions).

#### 4. **Bottom Red Blocks (Fixed, with Partial Adjacent Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Red blocks in bottom quadrants (y1/y2 ≥14; holes=0, various bboxes/sizes p=1–16).
   - **Properties Affected**: Own position/size (unchanged); triggers adjacent block additions (position relative, size related, color unknown).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Consistent across both trains: Bottom Red blocks remain fixed (same bbox, pixels, color, holes=0) in inputs to outputs (e.g., train1 right Red [19,18,21,20] p=9 unchanged; train2 left Red [4,19,7,22] p=16 unchanged).
     - Partial transformation: Fixed Reds consistently cause new small blocks (various colors) to appear adjacent (left/right/below relative positions, within same quadrant).
       - Relative position: Always immediate adjacent (e.g., x±1 or y+1; train1: left-adjacent to right Red at x=16–18 vs. Red x=19–21; below at y=21+).
       - Size relation: New blocks have pixels equal to or fraction (e.g., same p=9 in train1 left/right; same p=16 or half p=8 in train2)—consistent scaling pattern, but exact rule unknown.
       - Color: Unknown (varies; Green/Maroon in train1, Light Blue/Blue in train2—no consistent mapping).
     - Effect on yellows: Additions overlap bottom yellows, reducing pixels/holes as in #3.
     - No interaction with top blocks or grid beyond positional confinement.

#### Notes on Scope and Exclusions
- **Unknowns Called Out**: y-adjustment in top duplication (#2) is approximate but not fully explainable (varies by example). Bottom addition colors (#4) cannot be explained as consistent. No forced connections (e.g., no semantic meaning assumed for colors like "Maroon implies rotation," as not observable in data).
- **Exclusions**: 
  - Elements without consistent interaction (e.g., isolated single-pixel Reds like [3,20,3,20] p=1 in train1—fixed but no repeated effect beyond yellow overlap).
  - Inconsistent effects (e.g., bottom additions always happen but side/below directions vary slightly; not every bottom Red gets left/right/both).
  - Irrelevant: Pixel counts not tied to interactions (e.g., Blue grid p=53 static, no effect beyond division).
- Only these are present in **every** train example with direct, observable cause-effect (e.g., position causes duplication/overlap). No broader patterns inferred.

[2025-10-01 16:20:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (indexed 0-26) where patterns of numbers (primarily 2,3,8,9, with 1 for the central cross and 4 as empty space) in the upper-left quadrant (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) are processed and propagated/reflected to the other quadrants via specific symmetry and extension rules, ultimately filling the grid while preserving a central cross of 1's at row 13 and column 13. The processing differs based on whether 9's are present, involving reflections, block doublings, spreads, and extensions, but the goal is a symmetric, rule-compliant output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has quadrants: upper-left (input patterns), upper-right (horizontal reflection of left), lower-left (vertical or point reflection), lower-right (combined reflections/extensions); central row/column 13 is always 1's, overriding other values.
 * Upper processing includes horizontal reflection across col 13, spreading 8's upward/rightward only under specific conditions (e.g., paired 8's above paired 2's with empty above), and clearing exceptions like [2,2,3,3] in left cols 5-8 if below is all 4's, setting symmetric right cols 18-21 to 4.
 * Lower processing branches: if no 9's, use point reflection (180-degree symmetry from upper-left to lower-right), isolated 2-to-8 conversions below, upward 2 extensions in right, horizontal 3 extensions from 2 blocks (leftward/rightward), leftward 8 extensions in right by 1, and downward 8 spreads; if 9's present, clear lower grid and rebuild by doubling unique upper row patterns (non-4 sequences), placing them bottom-up in lower-left with mirrored reflections in lower-right based on binary indexing (1<<k for uniqueness), partial/full placements, and extra filler rows.
 * Subtleties: Doubling sequences shifts non-4 blocks to center the doubled length; uniques are deduplicated by full row tuple but extracted as contiguous non-4 sequences for mirroring; iterative changes for extensions to propagate fully; avoid overwriting existing non-4's; central cross set last; 9-presence check is global (any 9 in grid post-upper processing).
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections are conditional (only set if target is 4); block lengths for extensions use exact runs of 2's/8's; in has_nine mode, placement uses reverse sequences for right mirrors, and binary j-loop creates layered/mirrored patterns per unique; num_non4_rows counts rows with any non-4 for placement height, but extras use last pattern without right mirror.
 * All attempts must handle empty/all-4 upper rows (default to all-4 or last pattern); preserve input non-4's unless explicitly cleared; ensure symmetry doesn't create overlaps or invalid spreads.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-4 blocks from left-center, doubles their lengths centered via shift, fills rest with 4's.
    # Helpful for has_nine mode to create symmetric doubled patterns from unique rows.
    blocks = []
    first_non4 = -1
    n_non4 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < center:
        if row_data[i] == 4:
            i += 1
            continue
        if first_non4 == -1:
            first_non4 = i
        val = row_data[i]
        j = i
        while j < center and row_data[j] == val:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        blocks.append((val, length))
        n_non4 += length
        i = j
    if not blocks:
        return [4] * center
    shift = n_non4 // 2
    start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift)
    new_row = [4] * center
    pos = start_col
    for val, length in blocks:
        for _ in range(2 * length):
            if pos < center:
                new_row[pos] = val
            pos += 1
    return new_row
```

```python
def extract_uniques(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[List[int], int, int, List[int], int]]:
    # Helper to collect unique non-4 contiguous sequences from upper-left rows for has_nine rebuilding.
    # Useful for deduplicating and preparing mirrors; counts num_non4_rows separately.
    seen = set()
    uniques = []
    num_non4_rows = 0
    for r in range(13):
        row_data = g[r][:13]
        t = tuple(row_data)
        has_non4 = any(v != 4 for v in row_data)
        if has_non4:
            num_non4_rows += 1
        if has_non4 and t not in seen:
            non4_pos = [i for i in range(13) if row_data[i] != 4]
            min_c = min(non4_pos)
            max_c = max(non4_pos)
            seq = [row_data[i] for i in range(min_c, max_c + 1)]
            rev_seq = seq[::-1]
            uniques.append((row_data, min_c, max_c, rev_seq, max_c - min_c + 1))
            seen.add(t)
    return uniques, num_non4_rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt's upper processing mostly works (e.g., correct reflections and 8-spreads in training 1, producing expected 8's in rows 3-5 cols 20-21), but clear_exception_upper fails in training 1 by not triggering (generated has [2,2,3,3] in row 6 cols 5-8 with below all-4's, but doesn't clear right cols 18-21, leaving unintended 2's/3's).
 * In training 1 (no 9's), lower_no_nine over-extends 3's horizontally (generated rows 14-18 have extra [3,3,3,2,2,2] in cols 16-21 instead of all-4's until row 18), and vertical 2-upward spread doesn't propagate fully (row 20 has [2,3] in cols 3-4 but expected cleaner); point reflection works partially but leaves artifacts.
 * In training 2 (has 9's), process_lower_has_nine clears correctly but uniques extraction and placement fail: generates extra duplicated patterns in lower-left (rows 19-22 have repeated [9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1] but shifted/misplaced), right mirrors are incomplete/partial wrongly (e.g., row 21 has partial [1,1,2,2,9] in cols 17-22 instead of full), and extra rows don't fill properly (row 23 has misplaced [1,1,2,2,9] without symmetry); binary j-loop (1<<k) for placements creates unintended layers.
 * get_doubled_sequence is helpful but buggy in shift calculation for non-contiguous blocks (in training 2, doubles [9,2,2,1,1] but centers poorly, leading to overflow/misplacement).
 * reflect_upper_horizontal and spread_8_up_right are mostly correct and essential for upper quadrant symmetry/spread.
 * process_lower_no_nine's iterative upward 2-extend and 8-down spread work in simple cases but over-extend 3's from 2-blocks (e.g., L=2 2's extend 2 3's right, but in training 1 it bleeds into existing areas); horizontal 3-extend logic is flawed in right-half (starts from i=26 downward but breaks on non-4).
 * clear_exception_upper is broken: condition checks g[r][5:9] == [2,2,3,3] but in training 1 row 6 it's [2,2,3,3] yet doesn't clear right (possibly due to below_all4 miscalc or range(13) limit); not triggering when expected.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of branching (9-detection) and basic reflections, but fails on precise block extensions, unique placement logic, and exception clearing; no functions for validating symmetry post-process.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: upper quadrant processing adds unintended 8's/3's (e.g., row 3 has [8,8,3,3] in cols 3-6 but input likely simpler; row 5-6 have [9,9,9,9,2,2] which spreads oddly to right as [2,2,2,9,9,9,9] without full mirror symmetry).
 * Lower half is malformed in has_nine mode (assuming 9's present): rows 14-20 are mostly empty/partial 1's (e.g., row 15 has [1,1,1,1] in cols 4-7 but expected patterned from doubled uniques), rows 21-23 have scattered [1,1] without full blocks, row 24 has [1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9] misplaced, row 25 has oversized [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2] (9 9's instead of matching upper sequence length), and row 26/27 incomplete; lacks proper binary-layered mirrors and extra row fillers.
 * Central cross is set correctly (all row/col 13=1), but overall asymmetry (e.g., lower-right doesn't reflect upper-left's 9/2/1 patterns properly) and overfills (e.g., row 27 has [4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3] unrelated to input) indicate broken unique extraction/placement; does not match expected clean, symmetric propagation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 27x27 grid through symmetry operations (reflections across center lines and points), pattern spreading (e.g., propagating 8's downward/upward from pairs of 2's or 8's), conditional modifications (e.g., converting 3's to 4's or adding 3's adjacent to 2 blocks), and bifurcated lower-half rules depending on the presence of 9's, where the upper half influences the lower via copying, doubling, or clearing patterns while preserving a central column of 1's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has rotational/point symmetry around the center (row/column 13, 0-indexed), but reflections are conditional (e.g., only copy if the target position is 4, and left-to-right is horizontal flip in upper half, while lower uses point reflection or shifted mirroring).
 * Upper half always applies: Detect "changed_rows" (rows 1-12) where row r-1 has adjacent 8's in even-odd column pairs (0-1, 2-3, etc., up to <13) above adjacent 2's in row r; then horizontally reflect upper-left non-4's to upper-right only if right target is 4; spread 8's downward into those changed_rows' left pairs if conditions met; convert all 3's in changed_rows' left half to 4's; conditionally spread 8's upward in right half (rows 0-12, columns 14+ even-odd pairs) if below has 8's and current has 4's; exception for rows below max changed_row with specific left pattern (2,2,3,3 at cols 5-8) clears right cols 18-21 to 4's.
 * Lower half splits on has_nine: If no 9, use point reflection (r2=26-r, c2=26-c) from upper-left to lower-right (rows 14+, cols 14+) only if target is 4; extend 2-blocks in lower by adding 3's to adjacent 4's (left blocks extend right, right blocks extend left, only within halves); for isolated single 2's in lower-left (no adjacent 2's horizontally), set directly below (row+1, same col) from 4 to 8 if it's 4; reflect/spread upper-left 8-block to lower-right via point reflection, then extend leftward by one col if possible, and spread downward row-by-row for the block's height if entire target row segment is 4's.
 * If has_nine, clear lower (rows 14-26) to 4's everywhere except central col 13=1; identify unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns (rows 0-12, cols 0-12), place them doubled (group consecutive same non-4 values into blocks, double each block's length, shift start by half total non-4 count in original row, place sequentially from left in lower-left) starting from bottom (row 26) upward, with 1 row for first unique, 2 for second, 4 for third, etc. (2^k rows per unique pattern); then for each upper row with non-4's in left, mirror to lower-right (target_row=26-r, target_col=26-c) without shift if target in bounds (cols 14+).
 * Subtleties: Doubling in has_nine preserves block identities but concatenates doubled lengths into a new sequence, starts placement at shifted col (max(0, first_non4_col - shift)); uniqueness ignores all-4 rows and duplicates exact tuple patterns; spreads/stretches stop if not all 4's in target; central row 13 is always all 1's in output; use original grid 'g' for conditions (e.g., changed_rows detection) to avoid mid-process overwrites; column pairs are even-odd starting from 0; lower clears override prior upper influences; isolated 2 rule only for single cells, not blocks; 8-spread in no-9 lower is height-limited and breaks if any non-4 in target segment.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections don't overwrite non-4's (only set if target==4); adding 3's to 2-blocks only where 4's exist and within half-boundaries (no cross-center); in has_nine, right reflection is per upper row to specific lower row, but only non-4 left cells, and cols wrap to 26-c (which may land in left for some); changed_rows exception uses original g and specific cols 5-8 pattern to clear cols 18-21 only in affected rows; upper-right spread is upward (from lower to upper), unlike left downward spread; no modifications to central column except setting to 1's; patterns like 9's trigger full lower rebuild from uniques, ignoring point reflection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helper classes or functions are defined in the program; all logic is inline in `program()`. The block extraction for doubling (in has_nine lower placement) is a helpful inline snippet that groups consecutive same values:
```python
# Inside has_nine lower placement loop
blocks = []
i = 0
while i < CENTER:
    if row_data[i] == 4:
        i += 1
        continue
    col = row_data[i]  # Note: 'col' reused confusingly for value
    j = i
    while j < CENTER and row_data[j] == col:
        j += 1
    l = j - i
    blocks.append((col, l))
    i = j
# Then compute n_non4 = sum(l for _, l in blocks), shift = n_non4 // 2, etc.
```
This is useful for identifying runs of numbers to double, but could be extracted to a function like `def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:` for clarity. No other tools; copy.deepcopy is used correctly for grid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt, so no prior iterations, but it demonstrates partial grasp of upper-half reflection/spread (e.g., horizontal flip and 8-propagation mostly work in train1 upper, as rows 0-3,4 match expected) but fails in details like not adding 3's correctly to right-side 2-blocks in lower no-9 case.
 * In train1 (no-9), upper changed_rows detection/spread works (8's in rows 4-5 left match), but lower point reflection misses some copies (e.g., row5 right has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2; row6 right has 3,3,2,2 matching but row7 right all 4's while expected also 4's? wait, row7 generated matches expected all 4's); add-3's logic applies but skips some right blocks (e.g., row18-20 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 matches expected, but row21 left has 2,3 instead of expected 2,3? minor, but row24 has 8,4 instead of all 4's, indicating over-spread of 8's); isolated 2 rule not triggering visibly; 8-block spread in lower right overextends (row24 has 8,8,8 while expected all 4's in that position, and row23 has 8,4 vs expected 4,4? wait, row23 expected all 4's pre-24).
 * In train1, exception clear not applying (row7 right cols18-21 should clear to 4's if pattern in row below changed, but generated has no 8's there anyway, so neutral); remove-3's in changed rows works (no 3's left in rows4-6 left).
 * In train2 (has-9), upper processing mostly matches (e.g., rows0-7,9-13 match expected, including 8/3 spreads and 9/2/1 placements), central row all 1's correct, but lower clear-then-place fails: unique patterns identified but doubling/shifting wrong (e.g., row20 left all 4's in generated but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1—suggests uniques placed but not doubled correctly or wrong order/shift; row23 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 matches but right has 1,1,2,2,9 instead of 4,4,3,8,4, indicating reflection applying to wrong targets or not skipping 4's); row24 left 4,4,9,9,... overplaces a pattern into what should be cleared 8,8,3,3; row25 left 4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3 matches expected but row26 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 same, but overall uniques seem to place 3 patterns (rows20-26 partially filled wrong).
 * Right reflection in has-9 applies but ignores bounds/shift (e.g., in train2 row23 right generated 1,1,2,2,9 from upper row3's left 3? but expected 3,8 from elsewhere? unknown why mismatch, possibly wrong target_col calc or applying to all non-4 without checking lower target==4).
 * Spread up right in upper works partially (train1 row3 right 8,8 matches), but in test generated, upper row2 right has 8,8 which may be over-spread.
 * No unhelpful functions; the inline block extraction is helpful but buggy in shift/placement (causes over/under-doubling in train2 lower left); the 8-spread down in no-9 lower breaks early correctly but initial reflection coords wrong (min_tc/max_tc from upper 8's point-reflected, but generated row24 8's where expected not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming has_nine=true due to 9's in upper) partially makes sense structurally (central col 1's correct, upper matches likely input transformations like 8/3/9/2/1 spreads in rows3-7,9-10; lower cleared to 4's/1's base, with some doubled-like patterns in rows20-26 left e.g., row25-26 has 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggesting partial unique doubling from upper row6-7's 9,2,2,1,1 but lengths not exactly doubled—9's are 4 in upper but 4 in lower left row25? wait, upper row5-6 has four 9's? input not shown but generated has four 9's left row5-6, so doubling to eight but placed as four? incomplete); right side reflections visible (e.g., row5-6 right 2,2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors left 2's/9's but shifted wrong, cols22-25 vs expected symmetric to left cols1-4? looks off by cols).
 * Does not look fully correct: Lower left placements irregular (row20 left all 4's but should place a unique if any; row21-22 left 4,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggests truncated doubling, missing full blocks; row23-24 left 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 but with extras like row25 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2 overlong, indicating wrong num_rows=1<<k assignment or shift causing overlap/out-of-bounds clipping); right lower has inconsistent mirrors (row20 right all 4's ok, but row25-26 right 3,3,8,8 vs left 2,2 not matching point-reflect of upper, and row23 right 2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors but expected more 8/3 from upper 8's?); upper row2 right 8,8 seems premature spread (if input has no triggering 4's below); overall, doubling logic fails to produce exact expected lengths/shifts, and reflections overwrite or miss, so likely incorrect—needs better unique selection (skip duplicates properly) and reflection bounds check (target_col >=14 and <=26).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a symmetry and propagation puzzle on a 27x27 grid centered at row/column 13, where patterns (using numbers 1-9, with 4 as background/empty) in the upper-left quadrant are detected, extended, reflected across the vertical and horizontal centers, and sometimes doubled or specially handled in the lower half based on the presence of 9's, creating mirrored or transformed structures while filling gaps and respecting sources like 2's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross of 1's (column 13 all 1's, row 13 all 1's), which acts as a divider and symmetry axis; nothing should overwrite this except possibly in reflections.
 * Upper-left (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) patterns start with "sources" like isolated or blocked 2's above gaps of 4's; these propagate downward as 8's into the gaps until hitting another non-4, but only if the gap is valid (all 4's between a 2 and another 2).
 * Reflections: Upper-left non-4 values (except skipped sources) mirror to upper-right (cols 14-26) via tc = 26 - c; point-wise reflections from upper-left to lower-right via tr = 26 - r, tc = 26 - c, but only if target is 4.
 * Extensions: Blocks of 2's in upper-right extend leftward into adjacent 4's as 3's (limited by non-4 or center); in lower half (rows 14+), 2's extend rightward/leftward similarly into 4's as 3's.
 * Gaps and 8's: After propagation, fill upper gaps with 8's; in lower-right, extend 8 blocks left by 1 if possible, and spread 8's downward iteratively based on max upper gap size.
 * 9-handling: If any 9 exists anywhere (often introduced in patterns), clear lower half to mostly 1's in center col and 4's elsewhere; extract unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns, double their non-4 sequences (centered/shifted), and place them in lower half in blocks of size 2^idx (reversed order from bottom), then reflect subsets of these blocks to right side, skipping 8's in some cases, with special prev-block reflections for idx >=2.
 * No-9 case (else branch): Handle lower half without clearing—extend 2's bidirectionally to 3's, propagate isolated lower-left 2's downward as 8's in same col if below is 4, reflect upper-left point-wise to lower-right, extend lower-right 8's left by 1, and spread 8's down by max upper gap iterations.
 * Subtleties: Skip reflecting source 8's from propagations; exception clearing in upper rows after changes (e.g., clear specific right positions if left has [2,2,3,3]); isolated 2's only propagate down if single and below is 4; doubling shifts non-4 content to center-start; patterns are tuples for uniqueness, ignoring all-4 rows; reflections only overwrite 4's; lower placements start from bottom (row 26) upward.
 * Easy misses: Propagation only triggers on 8 above 2 with all-4 gap (not just any 2); max_gap for downward spread is from upper propagations only; in 9-case, reflections are partial (e.g., offsets for inner blocks, only non-8 values); lower extensions stop at center (col 13); 1's in patterns (e.g., near 2's or 9's) must be preserved exactly in doublings/reflections.
 * All attempts assume input g is the initial upper-left pattern with rest 4's, but processing modifies in place; N=27 fixed, CENTER=13.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-4 blocks from left-center, counts total non-4 length, shifts to center by half that length (floored), doubles each block's length, places in new row of 4's starting from adjusted pos.
    # Useful for 9-case lower block creation: preserves block values/lengths but doubles them contiguously, centering the content.
    # Works well for simple patterns but may shift incorrectly if first_non4 is far left (start_col clamps to 0).
    blocks = []
    first_non4 = -1
    n_non4 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < center:
        if row_data[i] == 4:
            i += 1
            continue
        if first_non4 == -1:
            first_non4 = i
        val = row_data[i]
        j = i
        while j < center and row_data[j] == val:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        blocks.append((val, length))
        n_non4 += length
        i = j
    if not blocks:
        return [4] * center
    shift = n_non4 // 2
    start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift)
    new_row = [4] * center
    pos = start_col
    for val, length in blocks:
        for _ in range(2 * length):
            if pos < center:
                new_row[pos] = val
            pos += 1
    return new_row
```

No other functions in the attempt are notably helpful; the main program() is monolithic and error-prone.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Partially captured upper propagations (e.g., 8's in rows 4-5 cols 5-6 match, 2's and 3's in rows 6-7 cols 5-8 match), center cross correct, but failed lower half: introduced extra 8's in row 3 right (expected none), misplaced 3's/2's in rows 18-20 (expected starting later, no extras), added unneeded 8's in row 21 col 3 and row 22 cols 19-21 (expected 8 only in row 21 cols 19-20, row 22 none); no 9's so else branch used, but extensions/reflections over-applied or mistimed.
 * Training 1: Upper-right extensions partial (e.g., missed some 3's from 2's), exception clear didn't trigger correctly (no changed_rows max affecting rows 5:9 pattern check), point reflections added extras in lower-right without proper isolation checks.
 * Training 2: Has 9's, so if-branch triggered but botched lower placement: uniques extraction likely wrong (e.g., row 5-6 patterns with 9,2,2,1,1 doubled incorrectly, leading to row 20 [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] which has extra length/positions vs expected [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] but wait, similar—actually mismatch in row 21-22: generated has 1's in cols 17-18 where expected has none, and 9's shifted; row 23 has 3,8 misplaced).
 * Training 2: Reflections in 9-case incomplete (e.g., missed full offset mirroring for block i=1, or prev-block copy for i>=2, leading to sparse right side in lower rows like 23-24); upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8's and 3's in rows 4-5), but introduced bogus 1's in lower-left row 21.
 * Both: Propagation logic finds some (k,m,c) but skip_sources prevents over-reflection partially; downward spread in no-9 case under-applied (max_gap=0? leading to no 8's in lower); isolated 2's propagation missed in lower (e.g., train1 row 20 col3=2 should propagate? but expected doesn't); get_doubled_sequence used but uniques list or block sizing (1<<idx) off, causing wrong row counts/placements.
 * Function get_doubled_sequence is helpful for 9-doubling but buggy on shift if n_non4 odd or first_non4 misaligned (e.g., train2 row5 doubling puts 9's/2's/1's centered wrong).
 * Main program has no explicit object extraction (e.g., no function to find all 2-blocks or 9-locations), making debugging hard; unhelpful as it hardcodes ranges like 5:9 or 18:22 without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies with inferred rules from trainings (e.g., upper-left row3 has 8,8,3,3 but expected from similar train1/2 might propagate differently—no visible 8-source above it, suggesting invalid propagation; row5-6 have 9's in cols1-4 but doubling/reflection in lower rows 24-25 overextends 9's/2's without matching unique patterns, and row7-8 have 1's in cols5-6 which may be unintended 1-spillover since center is col13; lower-left rows20-26 mostly empty 4's but expected extensions/reflections from upper 2's/3's/8's/9's, e.g., row24 should have reflected 9's/2's from upper but has isolated 1's instead; no-9? but 9's present so if-branch should clear/repopulate lower but results in partial fills like row25 [9's,2's] mismatched length/position vs doubled uniques; overall, symmetry broken (e.g., upper-right row3 3,3,8,8 but lower-right sparse), and extra 8's in row27 left suggest over-extension—likely max_gap miscalc or reflection overwrite error.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (N=27, center at 13) where cells contain integers (1-9, with 4 likely representing empty/blank space), and the goal is to transform an input grid by applying symmetry rules (reflections, extensions), pattern spreading (for 8s and 3s from 2s), central cross filling with 1s, and special handling for the lower half based on presence of 9s (using unique row sequences that are doubled and mirrored) or absence (extending patterns downward with height matching and adjustments). The output is a completed grid that mirrors and extends upper patterns into the lower half while preserving or generating specific motifs like pairs of 2s/3s, 8s, and 9s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Central cross: Always set column 13 to 1s across all rows, and row 13 to all 1s— this is foundational and supersedes other rules.
 * Upper half processing (rows 0-12): Apply horizontal reflection (mirror left to right across center), but only fill if target is 4; spread 8s upward in upper-right if below has adjacent 8s and above is blank; extend 3s leftward from right-side 2-runs in upper rows if target is blank; handle exceptions like clearing specific [2,2,3,3] patterns in columns 5-8 if below is all 4s, by blanking columns 18-21.
 * Lower half processing (rows 14-26): Diverges based on presence of 9 anywhere in grid—if 9s exist, clear lower to central 1s, extract unique non-4 rows from upper (considering only first 13 cols, ignoring duplicates), double their non-4 sequences centered/shifted, place them bottom-up with 2^idx rows per unique, and mirror reversed sequences rightward for even/odd idx with specific top/bottom conditions; if no 9s, clear lower left to 4s, extend 2-runs rightward to 3s in left, leftward from right 2s, match total height of upper 2s (double it), iteratively extend upward from lower 2/3 segments if above is blank, reflect upper non-4s to lower-right if conditions met (e.g., 8s from changed rows), spread 8s left/downward if adjacent blanks, clear 3-runs adjacent to 8s, restore special saved rows, and add isolated 8s below single 2s.
 * Subtleties: Non-4 sequences are contiguous (min_c to max_c); doubling shifts by half non-4 length, starting from first non-4 pos; reflections are point-symmetric (row r, col c to 26-r, 26-c); 8-spreading is conditional on pairs and blanks; 3-extensions stop at center/14 boundaries; height matching for no-9 case uses max upper 2-height *2, extends iteratively up to that; special rows (reflections of changed upper pairs) are saved/restored before final extensions; 9-handling uses binary row counts (1<<idx) and idx-based mirroring logic (even/odd, top/bottom placement); all changes only overwrite 4s; grid is symmetric but upper drives lower.
 * Easy-to-miss: extract_uniques only considers rows 0-12, first 13 cols, and unique tuples with non-4 present; doubled_sequence skips 4s in count/shift but fills from start_col; no-9 lower has complex upward extension loop that counts iterations and segments including adjacent 3s; final 8-spreading in lower extends left and down separately; clearing 3s next to 8s only if directly adjacent rightward; isolated 2s in restored rows can seed downward 8s.
 * General: Grid is copied deeply; processes upper first, then lower; assumes input has patterns in upper/left, blanks elsewhere; outputs must match expected exactly, including no overfills.

*The main program function integrates these but is overly complex/buggy; the above helpers are solid for pattern extraction/doubling but need correct integration. No types defined beyond lists/tuples.*

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (the "last submission"); both training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of lower-half rules.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 3,3,2,2 in lower rows 17-19 (cols 18-23) and misplaced 8s (e.g., row 20 has 8 at col 3 instead of 4s; row 24 has isolated 4s where 8s expected); also row 21 has 8,4 instead of 4,8 pattern—mismatches suggest over-extension of 3s from 2s or failed reflection/spread; upper matches expected mostly, but exception clear didn't fully blank cols 18-21 in row 6; no-9 path taken correctly but height/extension logic buggy (max_2_height likely miscomputed, leading to incomplete downward 8-spread).
 * Train 2: Generated mismatches in lower rows, e.g., row 20 all 4s but expected 9s/2s/1s; row 23 has 4,4,3,8 instead of 4,3,8,4 (misplaced 3); row 24 has extra 3,3 vs expected 8,8,3,3; row 26 has 4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,3,3 but prior rows wrong—suggests 9-present path taken but doubling/mirroring logic flawed (e.g., wrong which_u selection for even/odd idx, or rev_seq placement start_col=26-max_c-1 off); upper has stray 1s/9s not in expected.
 * extract_uniques and get_doubled_sequence are helpful/essential for 9-case but underused/buggy in integration (e.g., placement conditions like is_even_k, is_top/is_bottom not triggering correctly, leading to missing or extra placements).
 * No-9 path has issues: saved_special restoration conflicts with extensions; upward extension loop (while changed and < additional_up) over- or under-extends (e.g., doesn't fully match target_h= max_2_height*2); 8-spreading left/down misses conditions (e.g., doesn't extend left fully in train 1 row 20).
 * Exception clear in upper works partially but doesn't propagate to lower mirrors.
 * Overall: Core symmetries (central 1s, upper reflection) work; 8-spread upward ok; but lower divergence (9 vs no-9), height matching, iterative extensions, and placement logic (idx-based rows, rev_seq mirroring) are broken—leads to overfills/misplacements; program too long/complex, with redundant loops (e.g., multiple 2/3/8 scans per row).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies like upper row 2 with 8,8 in cols 22-23 (unexpected, as input likely lacks triggering pair above); row 5/6 with 9s in cols 1-4 and 23-26 but asymmetric (left 4,9,9,9,9 vs right 9,9,9,9,4—mismatches expected symmetry); rows 7-8 have 1,1 in cols 5-6 and 20-21 but expected might be blanks or extended; lower rows 20-21 have 1,1 in cols 4-7 and partial in 19-20 (incomplete mirroring); row 23 has 1,1,1,1 in cols 4-7 but right has 1,1 in 19-20 (asymmetric); row 24 has 2,2,9s rightward but left 1s (suggests flawed doubling/rev_seq placement); row 25 has full 9s left and 3,3,8,8 right (over-extension or wrong which_u); row 26 has 8s/3s but sparse—overall, 9s trigger path but mirroring/doubling shifts wrong (e.g., start_col misaligned, num_rows=1<<idx over/under-places), and no-9 elements like 8-spreads leak in; doesn't match expected clean symmetry (mentally, test input seems 9-present with upper 8/3/2/9/1 patterns needing precise bottom-up doubling + right rev-seq for 3-4 uniques, but output has extras/misses like unpaired 9s and incomplete 8s downward).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Consistent Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of only those components, properties, and interactions that are obvious, directly observable, and consistent across **both** train examples (input 1/output 1 and input 2/output 2). I focused solely on elements with clear, repeated connections or effects (e.g., one property causing transformation in another, or components influencing each other's position/color/size). Irrelevant or static elements without dynamic interaction (e.g., isolated pixels not affecting others) are excluded. Interactions that vary (e.g., inconsistent color changes or y-shifts) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained without forcing a pattern. No high-level puzzle solution or test input analysis is included, as instructed.

#### 1. **Blue Grid Lines (Fixed Component)**
   - **Properties**: Color=Blue, holes=0, bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53 (unchanged in every input/output).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Provides fixed positional reference for all other components (e.g., all small blocks and yellow quadrants are placed relative to its vertical/horizontal lines at x=13 and y=13, dividing into quadrants).
     - No dynamic transformation, but consistently affects placement: All small rectangular blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue) are confined within or adjacent to quadrants defined by it, without crossing lines.
     - Consistent effect on yellow backgrounds: Grid overlaps yellow areas, contributing to their base pixel counts (yellow pixels decrease predictably when small blocks overlap within quadrants).

#### 2. **Top-Left Small Rectangular Blocks → Top-Right Duplication (Position → Position/Color/Size Transformation)**
   - **Components Involved**: Small blocks (colors: Maroon, Green, Light Blue, Blue, Red; all holes=0, rectangular bboxes, pixels=1–4) located in top-left quadrant (x1/x2 ≤12, y1/y2 ≤12).
   - **Properties Affected**: Position (x-mirrored), color (preserved), size (pixels preserved), shape (bbox dimensions preserved in x, approximate in y).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Consistent across both trains: Each top-left small block causes a new block of **same color** and **same pixels** to appear in top-right quadrant (x1/x2 ≥14, y1/y2 ≤12).
     - Specific transformation: x-position mirrored via x1' = 26 - x2, x2' = 26 - x1 (exact in both trains, e.g., train2 Blue [7,5,8,6] → [18,5,19,6]; train1 Green [7,6,8,7] → x=[18,?,19,?]).
     - y-position: Approximately preserved (similar y-range), but exact rule unknown (no shift in train2; consistent up-shift by 1 unit in train1 for added blocks—cannot explain without speculation).
     - If a target position already has a block (e.g., existing Red [20,5,21,6] p=4 in both trains), no new block is added there, but the interaction still applies to other top-left blocks.
     - No effect on holes (remains 0) or non-top-left blocks.
     - Consistent exclusion: Does not apply to bottom or yellow components directly.

#### 3. **Small Rectangular Blocks → Yellow Backgrounds (Position/Overlap → Pixel Count/Holes Adjustment)**
   - **Components Involved**: All small blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue; holes=0) and yellow quadrant backgrounds (color=Yellow, large bboxes covering [0,0,12,12], [14,0,26,12], [0,14,12,26], [14,14,26,26]).
   - **Properties Affected**: Yellow pixels (decreased), yellow holes (may change from 1 to 0).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Consistent across both trains: Placement of any small block within a yellow quadrant reduces that quadrant's pixel count by exactly the block's pixel value (e.g., train1: added Green p=4 reduces adjacent yellow by ~4; train2: multiple additions reduce bottom-left yellow from 153 to 117, matching total overlap area).
     - Overlap rule: Direct subtraction based on shared bbox area; no effect if no overlap.
     - Holes interaction: Yellow starts with holes=1 in all inputs; small blocks can cause holes=0 in outputs if coverage is sufficient (consistent in train2 bottom-left; not triggered in train1—exact threshold unknown).
     - Bidirectional: Yellows do not transform small blocks, but their pixel/hole changes are a direct effect of small block positions.
     - Consistent across all four quadrants, but most pronounced in top (due to duplications) and bottom (due to additions).

#### 4. **Bottom Red Blocks (Fixed, with Partial Adjacent Interaction)**
   - **Components Involved**: Red blocks in bottom quadrants (y1/y2 ≥14; holes=0, various bboxes/sizes p=1–16).
   - **Properties Affected**: Own position/size (unchanged); triggers adjacent block additions (position relative, size related, color unknown).
   - **Interactions/Connections**:
     - Consistent across both trains: Bottom Red blocks remain fixed (same bbox, pixels, color, holes=0) in inputs to outputs (e.g., train1 right Red [19,18,21,20] p=9 unchanged; train2 left Red [4,19,7,22] p=16 unchanged).
     - Partial transformation: Fixed Reds consistently cause new small blocks (various colors) to appear adjacent (left/right/below relative positions, within same quadrant).
       - Relative position: Always immediate adjacent (e.g., x±1 or y+1; train1: left-adjacent to right Red at x=16–18 vs. Red x=19–21; below at y=21+).
       - Size relation: New blocks have pixels equal to or fraction (e.g., same p=9 in train1 left/right; same p=16 or half p=8 in train2)—consistent scaling pattern, but exact rule unknown.
       - Color: Unknown (varies; Green/Maroon in train1, Light Blue/Blue in train2—no consistent mapping).
     - Effect on yellows: Additions overlap bottom yellows, reducing pixels/holes as in #3.
     - No interaction with top blocks or grid beyond positional confinement.

#### Notes on Scope and Exclusions
- **Unknowns Called Out**: y-adjustment in top duplication (#2) is approximate but not fully explainable (varies by example). Bottom addition colors (#4) cannot be explained as consistent. No forced connections (e.g., no semantic meaning assumed for colors like "Maroon implies rotation," as not observable in data).
- **Exclusions**: 
  - Elements without consistent interaction (e.g., isolated single-pixel Reds like [3,20,3,20] p=1 in train1—fixed but no repeated effect beyond yellow overlap).
  - Inconsistent effects (e.g., bottom additions always happen but side/below directions vary slightly; not every bottom Red gets left/right/both).
  - Irrelevant: Pixel counts not tied to interactions (e.g., Blue grid p=53 static, no effect beyond division).
- Only these are present in **every** train example with direct, observable cause-effect (e.g., position causes duplication/overlap). No broader patterns inferred.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 16:31:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (with a central cross at row/column 13 filled with 1s) where patterns of numbers (1-9, with 4 as background/empty) in the upper-left 13x13 quadrant are transformed, mirrored, and propagated to the lower-right quadrant, incorporating rules for doubling sequences, reversals, special handling for 9s (which trigger unique row extraction and block-based filling), and conversions like isolated 2s to 8s or extending runs downward. The goal is to generate a symmetric or rule-compliant output grid that matches expected patterns, often involving partial mirroring, sequence expansion, and conditional filling based on the presence of 9s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is divided into quadrants: upper-left (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) provides source patterns; central row/column 13 is always a cross of 1s; lower-right (rows 14-26, cols 14-26) is filled by mirroring/reversing upper patterns, but not always fully symmetrically—partial or shifted placements occur based on sequence lengths.
 * Non-4 cells in upper rows are extracted as unique sequences (ignoring duplicates via seen set), with reversals applied to the right side (cols 14-26); sequences are sometimes doubled in length before placement, centered or shifted to align non-4 content.
 * If no 9s are present (has_nines=False), lower processing focuses on extending 2-runs rightward/leftward into adjacent 4s to create 3s, mirroring upper non-4s to lower-right, handling isolated 2s by placing 8s below them, and extending 8-runs downward into 4s.
 * If 9s are present (has_nines=True), use unique upper rows to define "blocks" of rows in the lower half (allocated via bit-shift num=1<<k, stacking from bottom up), fill each block with doubled versions of the unique row in left cols 0-12, then conditionally fill right cols 14+ with reversals (full for rows with 9s, partial for others, and special prev-block spillover at bottom).
 * Subtleties: Sequence doubling in get_doubled_sequence skips 4s, centers on non-4 content (shift = n_non4 // 2), and pads with 4s; upper processing mirrors sequences to the right via reversal starting at t_start=26-max_c; special upper fixes like clearing [18:22] to 4s if [5:9]==[2,2,3,3] and next row all 4s, or propagating 8s upward from below in paired columns; lower mirroring copies upper non-4s to symmetric lower-right positions (tr=26-r, tc=26-c); 8-runs extend leftward if adjacent to 4 and propagate downward; count non-4 rows but it's underused; always set lower row 13 to 1 in has_nine case.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reversals are only for contiguous non-4 sequences; partial lengths (e.g., len_r//2) for non-9 uniques; block allocation for 9s starts from row 26 downward (current=26, top=current-num+1); prev-block reversal spillover only at exact bottom row; isolated 2 check is single-cell (not run) and only if below is 4; upper pairs like (14,15) etc. are for specific 8-propagation from below.
 * All attempts must deepcopy input to avoid mutation; process upper before checking for 9s (since upper can introduce changes but not 9s); lower-right filling overwrites but respects existing 1s in col 13.

```python
def process_upper(grid: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    # Mirrors non-4 sequences in upper rows to right side (cols 14-26) via reversal, positioned from t_start=26-max_c to t_end=26-min_c; includes special fixes like clearing [18:22] to 4s for [2,2,3,3] patterns with empty below, and upward 8-propagation in paired cols (14-15, etc.) if below has 8s and current is 4s. Partially helpful but over-applies or mispositions in some cases (e.g., doesn't handle all symmetries).
    # (Full code as in attempt; note: in-place, scans left-only for seqs.)
```

The other functions (process_lower_no_nine, process_lower_has_nine) are helpful in structure (e.g., extending 2s to 3s, mirroring via tr=26-r/tc=26-c, isolated 2->below 8, 8-run extensions) but buggy in execution (e.g., i=14 start for right-side scans assumes col 13 is 1/not 2; block_info allocation for 9s works but spillover and partial fills misalign; downward 8 extension assumes all-below-4 but doesn't check bounds fully).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt shown; both training examples failed despite complex logic attempting symmetry and 9-handling.
 * Train 1 (no 9s): Generated correctly set central cross and some upper mirroring (e.g., 8s in rows 3-5 cols 20-21 match expected), and lower 3,3,2,2 in rows 18-20 cols 16-21 partially match, but failed on: row 5 cols 18-21 has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2 (missed 3-extension?); row 6 cols 18-21 has 3,3,2,2 but expected 3,3,2,2 (match, but inconsistent); row 21 col 3=2/4=3 but expected 2,3; row 21 cols 19-21=8,8,8 but expected 4,4,4 (over-propagated 8s?); row 24-26 all 4s in lower but expected 8s in cols 19-21 (missed downward extension). Unknown why 3s missing in some 2-extensions.
 * Train 2 (has 9s): Generated upper mirroring partial (e.g., row 3 col 6=3 matches, row 4 cols 5-6=8,3 match, rows 5-6 9,2,2,1,1 match), central cross ok, but lower failed: row 20 cols 1-3=4,2,2 instead of 9,9,2 (missed block doubling/mirroring); row 21 cols 18-21=4,2,2,4 but expected 1,1,2,2,9 (wrong reversal/partial); row 22 matches expected but row 23 cols 18-21=1,1,2,2,9 match only partially; row 24 cols 4-7=8,8,3,3 match but row 25 cols 19=3 instead of 4 (extra prop?); row 26 all 4s but expected 4,4,3,3 (missed final block). Block allocation seems off for multi-uniques.
 * Overall: Captures core symmetry (26-r/c reversal) and 9-branching, but misfires on sequence extensions (2->3, 8 downward), partial fills in 9-case (e.g., len_r//2 too simplistic), and upper special cases (e.g., pairs propagate wrong). extract_uniques is essential and mostly correct (uniques list useful), get_doubled_sequence helpful but shift/first_non4 logic causes misalignment in doubling. process_upper's t_start/end positioning works for simple cases but not with gaps. No unhelpful functions, but process_lower_has_nine's block_info (bit-shift stacking) is overcomplicated and buggy for >2 uniques (current=top-1 overlaps?); the prev_k spillover only at bottom is specific but misapplied.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows inconsistencies similar to training failures, suggesting incomplete rule capture. Upper mirroring is partial (e.g., row 2 cols 22-23=8,8 but input has no clear source; row 3 cols 4-7=8,8,3,3 matches possible reversal of upper 3,3,8,8? but positions off); rows 5-6 have 9,9,9,9,2,2 which seems like doubled 9-run but expected likely more precise mirroring without extra 9s in col 0; row 7-8 have 1,1 in cols 5-6/20-21, possibly from upper 1s but input lacks them (over-propagation?); lower has row 20 empty-ish but expected 2-runs; row 21 has 1,1,1,1 in cols 4-7 but input/expected likely 1s only central; row 24 has 2,2,9,9,9,9 but asymmetric to upper 9s; row 27 (last) has 4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3 which extends but doesn't mirror upper fully (e.g., no symmetric 8s above). It partially makes sense for 9-handling (doubled blocks visible) but fails symmetry (e.g., lower-left has 9s bleeding incorrectly, no clear isolated 2->8), and looks overfilled in places (extra 1s, 8s) while underfilling others (missing 3s from 2s). To handle test, need better block sizing for multiple 9-rows and precise reversal starts (e.g., start_col_r =14 + min_c).

[2025-10-01 16:31:16] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **both** train examples. These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation, position, or presence) in a consistent manner between input and output for every train pair. I focused only on patterns that hold true in **both** examples without exception, ignoring isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., unique one-off shapes like the single Red at [3,20,3,20] in Train 1, which does not appear or interact similarly in Train 2). No high-level solving or total puzzle understanding is included—only direct, observable linkages. Unknown or unexplainable transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes in Yellow regions beyond shape overlaps) are noted as such.

Interactions are described as "Component A → Property of Component B" to highlight the connection, with evidence from consistency across trains.

1. **Blue cross lines (full-canvas overlay) → Unchanging positional framework for all quadrants**  
   - The Blue element (bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) remains identical in position, size, and properties across both inputs and outputs in Train 1 and Train 2.  
   - Interaction: It consistently divides the canvas into four Yellow quadrants, constraining all other colored shapes (e.g., Maroon, Green, Red) to quadrant-specific positions without overlapping or altering the Blue itself. No transformation of Blue occurs; it acts as a static "boundary" affecting placement of adjacent shapes.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (unchanged in input/output pairs).

2. **Yellow quadrant backgrounds (four regions) ↔ Pixel count adjustments from overlapping colored shapes**  
   - Four Yellow elements (holes=1, bboxes covering [0,0,12,12], [14,0,26,12], [0,14,12,26], [14,14,26,26]) are present in all inputs/outputs.  
   - Interaction: Pixel counts in each Yellow quadrant consistently change in outputs due to overlaps/additions of small colored shapes (e.g., Red, Green squares/bars) placed within their bboxes. For example, in both trains, bottom-left Yellow ([0,14,12,26]) pixel count decreases when new small shapes (e.g., Green/Red units) are added nearby, indicating direct area overlap effect. Exact mechanism of pixel adjustment is unknown (e.g., subtraction/addition rules not consistent beyond overlap presence).  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (all four Yellows present; pixel changes tied to shape placements in every pair).

3. **Small Red squares (2x2 units, pixels=4) in top-right quadrant upper edge → Static positional anchor unaffected by other transformations**  
   - Red (bbox=[20,5,21,6], pixels=4, holes=0) appears in the top-right quadrant ([14,0,26,12]) upper area.  
   - Interaction: This specific Red remains unchanged in position, color, size, and pixels across inputs and outputs in both trains, while nearby shapes (e.g., added Greens or Maroons) transform around it without affecting it. It acts as a "fixed point" that other color cycles (e.g., Green/Blue additions) reference for adjacency but do not alter.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (present and identical in all input/output pairs).

4. **Color-cycled polyomino components (Maroon → Green → Red → Blue sequence) in bottom-left quadrant → Mirrored positional duplication with color shift in top-right quadrant**  
   - In bottom-left quadrant ([0,14,12,26]), small adjacent units form partial polyominoes (e.g., Maroon [5,4,5,4 or similar], Red [5,5,6,6], Green/Blue bars pixels=2-4). Colors follow a partial cycle (Maroon-Green-Red-Blue).  
   - Interaction: In outputs, these consistently duplicate to symmetric positions in top-right quadrant ([14,0,26,12]), with a color shift forward in the cycle (e.g., Maroon → Green duplication at mirrored x/y coords like [20,3,21,4] in Train 1; similar Green/Red → Blue/Light Blue in Train 2 at [18,5,19,6] or [22,5,22,6]). Position mirroring is consistent (e.g., left-side x=4-8 maps to right-side x=18-22 via center symmetry at x=13). No rotation observed here—pure positional/color shift. Affects Yellow pixel counts in target quadrant via overlap.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (cycle-based duplication with color shift occurs in every input/output pair; sequence partial but always Maroon-influenced start).

5. **L-shaped or bar polyominoes (pixels=9-16, multi-unit Red/Green/Blue) in bottom-right lower area → Partial decomposition into smaller color-cycled units with positional spread**  
   - In bottom-right quadrant lower ([14,14,26,26], y=18+), larger Red/Green shapes (e.g., [19,18,21,20] pixels=9 in Train 1; [4,19,7,22] pixels=16 in Train 2, though latter is left but similar form).  
   - Interaction: In outputs, these consistently "decompose" into smaller units (pixels=1-9) spread horizontally/vertically within the same quadrant, with color cycle application (e.g., Red → Green/Maroon additions at adjacent positions like [16,18,18,20] Green in Train 1 or [17,20,18,21] Blue in Train 2). Position spreads consistently left/right from original bbox center (e.g., original x=19-21 spreads to x=16-21). Affects Yellow pixel counts via new overlaps; exact decomposition rule (e.g., why pixels=9 becomes two units) is unknown.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (decomposition with color cycle and positional spread in every input/output pair).

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **No forced connections**: Elements like standalone single-pixel Reds (e.g., [3,20,3,20] in Train 1) or Light Blue in Train 2 only were excluded as they lack interaction or consistency across both trains (no equivalent in the other). Hole counts (always 0 for shapes, 1 for Yellows) do not interact or change consistently.
- **Unknowns called out**: Pixel count changes in Yellows are consistently tied to overlaps but cannot be explained beyond "addition of shapes reduces available Yellow pixels" (no consistent formula, e.g., Train 1 bottom-left drops by ~2, Train 2 by ~36). No consistent vertical mirroring observed (only horizontal/quadrant-specific). Color cycles are partial (not full purple-green-blue-red in every case) but always influence duplications.
- **Irrelevant elements ignored**: Background Yellow fills and Blue cross are foundational but only listed where they interact (e.g., constraining positions). No semantic meanings (e.g., "hook shapes") assumed beyond pixel/bbox data.
- This list is derived solely from the two train pairs; Test Input 1 was not used for identification as it lacks an output for verification. No solving attempted.

[2025-10-01 16:32:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (indexed 0-26) where patterns of numbers (primarily 2,3,8,9, with 1 for the central cross and 4 as empty space) in the upper-left quadrant (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) are processed and propagated/reflected to the other quadrants via specific symmetry and extension rules, ultimately filling the grid while preserving a central cross of 1's at row 13 and column 13. The processing differs based on whether 9's are present, involving reflections, block doublings, spreads, and extensions, but the goal is a symmetric, rule-compliant output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has quadrants: upper-left (input patterns), upper-right (horizontal reflection of left), lower-left (vertical or point reflection), lower-right (combined reflections/extensions); central row/column 13 is always 1's, overriding other values.
 * Upper processing includes horizontal reflection across col 13, spreading 8's upward/rightward only under specific conditions (e.g., paired 8's above paired 2's with empty above), and clearing exceptions like [2,2,3,3] in left cols 5-8 if below is all 4's, setting symmetric right cols 18-21 to 4.
 * Lower processing branches: if no 9's, use point reflection (180-degree symmetry from upper-left to lower-right), isolated 2-to-8 conversions below, upward 2 extensions in right, horizontal 3 extensions from 2 blocks (leftward/rightward), leftward 8 extensions in right by 1, and downward 8 spreads; if 9's present, clear lower grid and rebuild by doubling unique upper row patterns (non-4 sequences), placing them bottom-up in lower-left with mirrored reflections in lower-right based on binary indexing (1<<k for uniqueness), partial/full placements, and extra filler rows.
 * Subtleties: Doubling sequences shifts non-4 blocks to center the doubled length; uniques are deduplicated by full row tuple but extracted as contiguous non-4 sequences for mirroring; iterative changes for extensions to propagate fully; avoid overwriting existing non-4's; central cross set last; 9-presence check is global (any 9 in grid post-upper processing).
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections are conditional (only set if target is 4); block lengths for extensions use exact runs of 2's/8's; in has_nine mode, placement uses reverse sequences for right mirrors, and binary j-loop creates layered/mirrored patterns per unique; num_non4_rows counts rows with any non-4 for placement height, but extras use last pattern without right mirror.
 * All attempts must handle empty/all-4 upper rows (default to all-4 or last pattern); preserve input non-4's unless explicitly cleared; ensure symmetry doesn't create overlaps or invalid spreads.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

            seen.add(t)
    return uniques, num_non4_rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt's upper processing mostly works (e.g., correct reflections and 8-spreads in training 1, producing expected 8's in rows 3-5 cols 20-21), but clear_exception_upper fails in training 1 by not triggering (generated has [2,2,3,3] in row 6 cols 5-8 with below all-4's, but doesn't clear right cols 18-21, leaving unintended 2's/3's).
 * In training 1 (no 9's), lower_no_nine over-extends 3's horizontally (generated rows 14-18 have extra [3,3,3,2,2,2] in cols 16-21 instead of all-4's until row 18), and vertical 2-upward spread doesn't propagate fully (row 20 has [2,3] in cols 3-4 but expected cleaner); point reflection works partially but leaves artifacts.
 * In training 2 (has 9's), process_lower_has_nine clears correctly but uniques extraction and placement fail: generates extra duplicated patterns in lower-left (rows 19-22 have repeated [9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1] but shifted/misplaced), right mirrors are incomplete/partial wrongly (e.g., row 21 has partial [1,1,2,2,9] in cols 17-22 instead of full), and extra rows don't fill properly (row 23 has misplaced [1,1,2,2,9] without symmetry); binary j-loop (1<<k) for placements creates unintended layers.
 * get_doubled_sequence is helpful but buggy in shift calculation for non-contiguous blocks (in training 2, doubles [9,2,2,1,1] but centers poorly, leading to overflow/misplacement).
 * reflect_upper_horizontal and spread_8_up_right are mostly correct and essential for upper quadrant symmetry/spread.
 * process_lower_no_nine's iterative upward 2-extend and 8-down spread work in simple cases but over-extend 3's from 2-blocks (e.g., L=2 2's extend 2 3's right, but in training 1 it bleeds into existing areas); horizontal 3-extend logic is flawed in right-half (starts from i=26 downward but breaks on non-4).
 * clear_exception_upper is broken: condition checks g[r][5:9] == [2,2,3,3] but in training 1 row 6 it's [2,2,3,3] yet doesn't clear right (possibly due to below_all4 miscalc or range(13) limit); not triggering when expected.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of branching (9-detection) and basic reflections, but fails on precise block extensions, unique placement logic, and exception clearing; no functions for validating symmetry post-process.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: upper quadrant processing adds unintended 8's/3's (e.g., row 3 has [8,8,3,3] in cols 3-6 but input likely simpler; row 5-6 have [9,9,9,9,2,2] which spreads oddly to right as [2,2,2,9,9,9,9] without full mirror symmetry).
 * Lower half is malformed in has_nine mode (assuming 9's present): rows 14-20 are mostly empty/partial 1's (e.g., row 15 has [1,1,1,1] in cols 4-7 but expected patterned from doubled uniques), rows 21-23 have scattered [1,1] without full blocks, row 24 has [1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9] misplaced, row 25 has oversized [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2] (9 9's instead of matching upper sequence length), and row 26/27 incomplete; lacks proper binary-layered mirrors and extra row fillers.
 * Central cross is set correctly (all row/col 13=1), but overall asymmetry (e.g., lower-right doesn't reflect upper-left's 9/2/1 patterns properly) and overfills (e.g., row 27 has [4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3] unrelated to input) indicate broken unique extraction/placement; does not match expected clean, symmetric propagation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves transforming a 27x27 grid through symmetry operations (reflections across center lines and points), pattern spreading (e.g., propagating 8's downward/upward from pairs of 2's or 8's), conditional modifications (e.g., converting 3's to 4's or adding 3's adjacent to 2 blocks), and bifurcated lower-half rules depending on the presence of 9's, where the upper half influences the lower via copying, doubling, or clearing patterns while preserving a central column of 1's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has rotational/point symmetry around the center (row/column 13, 0-indexed), but reflections are conditional (e.g., only copy if the target position is 4, and left-to-right is horizontal flip in upper half, while lower uses point reflection or shifted mirroring).
 * Upper half always applies: Detect "changed_rows" (rows 1-12) where row r-1 has adjacent 8's in even-odd column pairs (0-1, 2-3, etc., up to <13) above adjacent 2's in row r; then horizontally reflect upper-left non-4's to upper-right only if right target is 4; spread 8's downward into those changed_rows' left pairs if conditions met; convert all 3's in changed_rows' left half to 4's; conditionally spread 8's upward in right half (rows 0-12, columns 14+ even-odd pairs) if below has 8's and current has 4's; exception for rows below max changed_row with specific left pattern (2,2,3,3 at cols 5-8) clears right cols 18-21 to 4's.
 * Lower half splits on has_nine: If no 9, use point reflection (r2=26-r, c2=26-c) from upper-left to lower-right (rows 14+, cols 14+) only if target is 4; extend 2-blocks in lower by adding 3's to adjacent 4's (left blocks extend right, right blocks extend left, only within halves); for isolated single 2's in lower-left (no adjacent 2's horizontally), set directly below (row+1, same col) from 4 to 8 if it's 4; reflect/spread upper-left 8-block to lower-right via point reflection, then extend leftward by one col if possible, and spread downward row-by-row for the block's height if entire target row segment is 4's.
 * If has_nine, clear lower (rows 14-26) to 4's everywhere except central col 13=1; identify unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns (rows 0-12, cols 0-12), place them doubled (group consecutive same non-4 values into blocks, double each block's length, shift start by half total non-4 count in original row, place sequentially from left in lower-left) starting from bottom (row 26) upward, with 1 row for first unique, 2 for second, 4 for third, etc. (2^k rows per unique pattern); then for each upper row with non-4's in left, mirror to lower-right (target_row=26-r, target_col=26-c) without shift if target in bounds (cols 14+).
 * Subtleties: Doubling in has_nine preserves block identities but concatenates doubled lengths into a new sequence, starts placement at shifted col (max(0, first_non4_col - shift)); uniqueness ignores all-4 rows and duplicates exact tuple patterns; spreads/stretches stop if not all 4's in target; central row 13 is always all 1's in output; use original grid 'g' for conditions (e.g., changed_rows detection) to avoid mid-process overwrites; column pairs are even-odd starting from 0; lower clears override prior upper influences; isolated 2 rule only for single cells, not blocks; 8-spread in no-9 lower is height-limited and breaks if any non-4 in target segment.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reflections don't overwrite non-4's (only set if target==4); adding 3's to 2-blocks only where 4's exist and within half-boundaries (no cross-center); in has_nine, right reflection is per upper row to specific lower row, but only non-4 left cells, and cols wrap to 26-c (which may land in left for some); changed_rows exception uses original g and specific cols 5-8 pattern to clear cols 18-21 only in affected rows; upper-right spread is upward (from lower to upper), unlike left downward spread; no modifications to central column except setting to 1's; patterns like 9's trigger full lower rebuild from uniques, ignoring point reflection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate helper classes or functions are defined in the program; all logic is inline in `program()`. The block extraction for doubling (in has_nine lower placement) is a helpful inline snippet that groups consecutive same values:
```python
# Inside has_nine lower placement loop
blocks = []
i = 0
while i < CENTER:
    if row_data[i] == 4:
        i += 1
        continue
    col = row_data[i]  # Note: 'col' reused confusingly for value
    j = i
    while j < CENTER and row_data[j] == col:
        j += 1
    l = j - i
    blocks.append((col, l))
    i = j
# Then compute n_non4 = sum(l for _, l in blocks), shift = n_non4 // 2, etc.
```
This is useful for identifying runs of numbers to double, but could be extracted to a function like `def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:` for clarity. No other tools; copy.deepcopy is used correctly for grid mutation.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt, so no prior iterations, but it demonstrates partial grasp of upper-half reflection/spread (e.g., horizontal flip and 8-propagation mostly work in train1 upper, as rows 0-3,4 match expected) but fails in details like not adding 3's correctly to right-side 2-blocks in lower no-9 case.
 * In train1 (no-9), upper changed_rows detection/spread works (8's in rows 4-5 left match), but lower point reflection misses some copies (e.g., row5 right has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2; row6 right has 3,3,2,2 matching but row7 right all 4's while expected also 4's? wait, row7 generated matches expected all 4's); add-3's logic applies but skips some right blocks (e.g., row18-20 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 matches expected, but row21 left has 2,3 instead of expected 2,3? minor, but row24 has 8,4 instead of all 4's, indicating over-spread of 8's); isolated 2 rule not triggering visibly; 8-block spread in lower right overextends (row24 has 8,8,8 while expected all 4's in that position, and row23 has 8,4 vs expected 4,4? wait, row23 expected all 4's pre-24).
 * In train1, exception clear not applying (row7 right cols18-21 should clear to 4's if pattern in row below changed, but generated has no 8's there anyway, so neutral); remove-3's in changed rows works (no 3's left in rows4-6 left).
 * In train2 (has-9), upper processing mostly matches (e.g., rows0-7,9-13 match expected, including 8/3 spreads and 9/2/1 placements), central row all 1's correct, but lower clear-then-place fails: unique patterns identified but doubling/shifting wrong (e.g., row20 left all 4's in generated but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1—suggests uniques placed but not doubled correctly or wrong order/shift; row23 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 matches but right has 1,1,2,2,9 instead of 4,4,3,8,4, indicating reflection applying to wrong targets or not skipping 4's); row24 left 4,4,9,9,... overplaces a pattern into what should be cleared 8,8,3,3; row25 left 4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3 matches expected but row26 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,4,4,4,4,3,3 same, but overall uniques seem to place 3 patterns (rows20-26 partially filled wrong).
 * Right reflection in has-9 applies but ignores bounds/shift (e.g., in train2 row23 right generated 1,1,2,2,9 from upper row3's left 3? but expected 3,8 from elsewhere? unknown why mismatch, possibly wrong target_col calc or applying to all non-4 without checking lower target==4).
 * Spread up right in upper works partially (train1 row3 right 8,8 matches), but in test generated, upper row2 right has 8,8 which may be over-spread.
 * No unhelpful functions; the inline block extraction is helpful but buggy in shift/placement (causes over/under-doubling in train2 lower left); the 8-spread down in no-9 lower breaks early correctly but initial reflection coords wrong (min_tc/max_tc from upper 8's point-reflected, but generated row24 8's where expected not).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (assuming has_nine=true due to 9's in upper) partially makes sense structurally (central col 1's correct, upper matches likely input transformations like 8/3/9/2/1 spreads in rows3-7,9-10; lower cleared to 4's/1's base, with some doubled-like patterns in rows20-26 left e.g., row25-26 has 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggesting partial unique doubling from upper row6-7's 9,2,2,1,1 but lengths not exactly doubled—9's are 4 in upper but 4 in lower left row25? wait, upper row5-6 has four 9's? input not shown but generated has four 9's left row5-6, so doubling to eight but placed as four? incomplete); right side reflections visible (e.g., row5-6 right 2,2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors left 2's/9's but shifted wrong, cols22-25 vs expected symmetric to left cols1-4? looks off by cols).
 * Does not look fully correct: Lower left placements irregular (row20 left all 4's but should place a unique if any; row21-22 left 4,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 suggests truncated doubling, missing full blocks; row23-24 left 1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9,9,9 but with extras like row25 9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2 overlong, indicating wrong num_rows=1<<k assignment or shift causing overlap/out-of-bounds clipping); right lower has inconsistent mirrors (row20 right all 4's ok, but row25-26 right 3,3,8,8 vs left 2,2 not matching point-reflect of upper, and row23 right 2,2,9,9,9,9 mirrors but expected more 8/3 from upper 8's?); upper row2 right 8,8 seems premature spread (if input has no triggering 4's below); overall, doubling logic fails to produce exact expected lengths/shifts, and reflections overwrite or miss, so likely incorrect—needs better unique selection (skip duplicates properly) and reflection bounds check (target_col >=14 and <=26).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a symmetry and propagation puzzle on a 27x27 grid centered at row/column 13, where patterns (using numbers 1-9, with 4 as background/empty) in the upper-left quadrant are detected, extended, reflected across the vertical and horizontal centers, and sometimes doubled or specially handled in the lower half based on the presence of 9's, creating mirrored or transformed structures while filling gaps and respecting sources like 2's.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross of 1's (column 13 all 1's, row 13 all 1's), which acts as a divider and symmetry axis; nothing should overwrite this except possibly in reflections.
 * Upper-left (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) patterns start with "sources" like isolated or blocked 2's above gaps of 4's; these propagate downward as 8's into the gaps until hitting another non-4, but only if the gap is valid (all 4's between a 2 and another 2).
 * Reflections: Upper-left non-4 values (except skipped sources) mirror to upper-right (cols 14-26) via tc = 26 - c; point-wise reflections from upper-left to lower-right via tr = 26 - r, tc = 26 - c, but only if target is 4.
 * Extensions: Blocks of 2's in upper-right extend leftward into adjacent 4's as 3's (limited by non-4 or center); in lower half (rows 14+), 2's extend rightward/leftward similarly into 4's as 3's.
 * Gaps and 8's: After propagation, fill upper gaps with 8's; in lower-right, extend 8 blocks left by 1 if possible, and spread 8's downward iteratively based on max upper gap size.
 * 9-handling: If any 9 exists anywhere (often introduced in patterns), clear lower half to mostly 1's in center col and 4's elsewhere; extract unique non-all-4 upper-left row patterns, double their non-4 sequences (centered/shifted), and place them in lower half in blocks of size 2^idx (reversed order from bottom), then reflect subsets of these blocks to right side, skipping 8's in some cases, with special prev-block reflections for idx >=2.
 * No-9 case (else branch): Handle lower half without clearing—extend 2's bidirectionally to 3's, propagate isolated lower-left 2's downward as 8's in same col if below is 4, reflect upper-left point-wise to lower-right, extend lower-right 8's left by 1, and spread 8's down by max upper gap iterations.
 * Subtleties: Skip reflecting source 8's from propagations; exception clearing in upper rows after changes (e.g., clear specific right positions if left has [2,2,3,3]); isolated 2's only propagate down if single and below is 4; doubling shifts non-4 content to center-start; patterns are tuples for uniqueness, ignoring all-4 rows; reflections only overwrite 4's; lower placements start from bottom (row 26) upward.
 * Easy misses: Propagation only triggers on 8 above 2 with all-4 gap (not just any 2); max_gap for downward spread is from upper propagations only; in 9-case, reflections are partial (e.g., offsets for inner blocks, only non-8 values); lower extensions stop at center (col 13); 1's in patterns (e.g., near 2's or 9's) must be preserved exactly in doublings/reflections.
 * All attempts assume input g is the initial upper-left pattern with rest 4's, but processing modifies in place; N=27 fixed, CENTER=13.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def get_doubled_sequence(row_data: List[int], center: int) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-4 blocks from left-center, counts total non-4 length, shifts to center by half that length (floored), doubles each block's length, places in new row of 4's starting from adjusted pos.
    # Useful for 9-case lower block creation: preserves block values/lengths but doubles them contiguously, centering the content.
    # Works well for simple patterns but may shift incorrectly if first_non4 is far left (start_col clamps to 0).
    blocks = []
    first_non4 = -1
    n_non4 = 0
    i = 0
    while i < center:
        if row_data[i] == 4:
            i += 1
            continue
        if first_non4 == -1:
            first_non4 = i
        val = row_data[i]
        j = i
        while j < center and row_data[j] == val:
            j += 1
        length = j - i
        blocks.append((val, length))
        n_non4 += length
        i = j
    if not blocks:
        return [4] * center
    shift = n_non4 // 2
    start_col = max(0, first_non4 - shift)
    new_row = [4] * center
    pos = start_col
    for val, length in blocks:
        for _ in range(2 * length):
            if pos < center:
                new_row[pos] = val
            pos += 1
    return new_row
```

No other functions in the attempt are notably helpful; the main program() is monolithic and error-prone.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Partially captured upper propagations (e.g., 8's in rows 4-5 cols 5-6 match, 2's and 3's in rows 6-7 cols 5-8 match), center cross correct, but failed lower half: introduced extra 8's in row 3 right (expected none), misplaced 3's/2's in rows 18-20 (expected starting later, no extras), added unneeded 8's in row 21 col 3 and row 22 cols 19-21 (expected 8 only in row 21 cols 19-20, row 22 none); no 9's so else branch used, but extensions/reflections over-applied or mistimed.
 * Training 1: Upper-right extensions partial (e.g., missed some 3's from 2's), exception clear didn't trigger correctly (no changed_rows max affecting rows 5:9 pattern check), point reflections added extras in lower-right without proper isolation checks.
 * Training 2: Has 9's, so if-branch triggered but botched lower placement: uniques extraction likely wrong (e.g., row 5-6 patterns with 9,2,2,1,1 doubled incorrectly, leading to row 20 [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] which has extra length/positions vs expected [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,4] but wait, similar—actually mismatch in row 21-22: generated has 1's in cols 17-18 where expected has none, and 9's shifted; row 23 has 3,8 misplaced).
 * Training 2: Reflections in 9-case incomplete (e.g., missed full offset mirroring for block i=1, or prev-block copy for i>=2, leading to sparse right side in lower rows like 23-24); upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8's and 3's in rows 4-5), but introduced bogus 1's in lower-left row 21.
 * Both: Propagation logic finds some (k,m,c) but skip_sources prevents over-reflection partially; downward spread in no-9 case under-applied (max_gap=0? leading to no 8's in lower); isolated 2's propagation missed in lower (e.g., train1 row 20 col3=2 should propagate? but expected doesn't); get_doubled_sequence used but uniques list or block sizing (1<<idx) off, causing wrong row counts/placements.
 * Function get_doubled_sequence is helpful for 9-doubling but buggy on shift if n_non4 odd or first_non4 misaligned (e.g., train2 row5 doubling puts 9's/2's/1's centered wrong).
 * Main program has no explicit object extraction (e.g., no function to find all 2-blocks or 9-locations), making debugging hard; unhelpful as it hardcodes ranges like 5:9 or 18:22 without generalization.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies with inferred rules from trainings (e.g., upper-left row3 has 8,8,3,3 but expected from similar train1/2 might propagate differently—no visible 8-source above it, suggesting invalid propagation; row5-6 have 9's in cols1-4 but doubling/reflection in lower rows 24-25 overextends 9's/2's without matching unique patterns, and row7-8 have 1's in cols5-6 which may be unintended 1-spillover since center is col13; lower-left rows20-26 mostly empty 4's but expected extensions/reflections from upper 2's/3's/8's/9's, e.g., row24 should have reflected 9's/2's from upper but has isolated 1's instead; no-9? but 9's present so if-branch should clear/repopulate lower but results in partial fills like row25 [9's,2's] mismatched length/position vs doubled uniques; overall, symmetry broken (e.g., upper-right row3 3,3,8,8 but lower-right sparse), and extra 8's in row27 left suggest over-extension—likely max_gap miscalc or reflection overwrite error.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (N=27, center at 13) where cells contain integers (1-9, with 4 likely representing empty/blank space), and the goal is to transform an input grid by applying symmetry rules (reflections, extensions), pattern spreading (for 8s and 3s from 2s), central cross filling with 1s, and special handling for the lower half based on presence of 9s (using unique row sequences that are doubled and mirrored) or absence (extending patterns downward with height matching and adjustments). The output is a completed grid that mirrors and extends upper patterns into the lower half while preserving or generating specific motifs like pairs of 2s/3s, 8s, and 9s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Central cross: Always set column 13 to 1s across all rows, and row 13 to all 1s— this is foundational and supersedes other rules.
 * Upper half processing (rows 0-12): Apply horizontal reflection (mirror left to right across center), but only fill if target is 4; spread 8s upward in upper-right if below has adjacent 8s and above is blank; extend 3s leftward from right-side 2-runs in upper rows if target is blank; handle exceptions like clearing specific [2,2,3,3] patterns in columns 5-8 if below is all 4s, by blanking columns 18-21.
 * Lower half processing (rows 14-26): Diverges based on presence of 9 anywhere in grid—if 9s exist, clear lower to central 1s, extract unique non-4 rows from upper (considering only first 13 cols, ignoring duplicates), double their non-4 sequences centered/shifted, place them bottom-up with 2^idx rows per unique, and mirror reversed sequences rightward for even/odd idx with specific top/bottom conditions; if no 9s, clear lower left to 4s, extend 2-runs rightward to 3s in left, leftward from right 2s, match total height of upper 2s (double it), iteratively extend upward from lower 2/3 segments if above is blank, reflect upper non-4s to lower-right if conditions met (e.g., 8s from changed rows), spread 8s left/downward if adjacent blanks, clear 3-runs adjacent to 8s, restore special saved rows, and add isolated 8s below single 2s.
 * Subtleties: Non-4 sequences are contiguous (min_c to max_c); doubling shifts by half non-4 length, starting from first non-4 pos; reflections are point-symmetric (row r, col c to 26-r, 26-c); 8-spreading is conditional on pairs and blanks; 3-extensions stop at center/14 boundaries; height matching for no-9 case uses max upper 2-height *2, extends iteratively up to that; special rows (reflections of changed upper pairs) are saved/restored before final extensions; 9-handling uses binary row counts (1<<idx) and idx-based mirroring logic (even/odd, top/bottom placement); all changes only overwrite 4s; grid is symmetric but upper drives lower.
 * Easy-to-miss: extract_uniques only considers rows 0-12, first 13 cols, and unique tuples with non-4 present; doubled_sequence skips 4s in count/shift but fills from start_col; no-9 lower has complex upward extension loop that counts iterations and segments including adjacent 3s; final 8-spreading in lower extends left and down separately; clearing 3s next to 8s only if directly adjacent rightward; isolated 2s in restored rows can seed downward 8s.
 * General: Grid is copied deeply; processes upper first, then lower; assumes input has patterns in upper/left, blanks elsewhere; outputs must match expected exactly, including no overfills.

*The main program function integrates these but is overly complex/buggy; the above helpers are solid for pattern extraction/doubling but need correct integration. No types defined beyond lists/tuples.*

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt (the "last submission"); both training examples failed, indicating partial but incomplete understanding of lower-half rules.
 * Train 1: Generated extra 3,3,2,2 in lower rows 17-19 (cols 18-23) and misplaced 8s (e.g., row 20 has 8 at col 3 instead of 4s; row 24 has isolated 4s where 8s expected); also row 21 has 8,4 instead of 4,8 pattern—mismatches suggest over-extension of 3s from 2s or failed reflection/spread; upper matches expected mostly, but exception clear didn't fully blank cols 18-21 in row 6; no-9 path taken correctly but height/extension logic buggy (max_2_height likely miscomputed, leading to incomplete downward 8-spread).
 * Train 2: Generated mismatches in lower rows, e.g., row 20 all 4s but expected 9s/2s/1s; row 23 has 4,4,3,8 instead of 4,3,8,4 (misplaced 3); row 24 has extra 3,3 vs expected 8,8,3,3; row 26 has 4,4,3,3 vs expected 4,4,3,3 but prior rows wrong—suggests 9-present path taken but doubling/mirroring logic flawed (e.g., wrong which_u selection for even/odd idx, or rev_seq placement start_col=26-max_c-1 off); upper has stray 1s/9s not in expected.
 * extract_uniques and get_doubled_sequence are helpful/essential for 9-case but underused/buggy in integration (e.g., placement conditions like is_even_k, is_top/is_bottom not triggering correctly, leading to missing or extra placements).
 * No-9 path has issues: saved_special restoration conflicts with extensions; upward extension loop (while changed and < additional_up) over- or under-extends (e.g., doesn't fully match target_h= max_2_height*2); 8-spreading left/down misses conditions (e.g., doesn't extend left fully in train 1 row 20).
 * Exception clear in upper works partially but doesn't propagate to lower mirrors.
 * Overall: Core symmetries (central 1s, upper reflection) work; 8-spread upward ok; but lower divergence (9 vs no-9), height matching, iterative extensions, and placement logic (idx-based rows, rev_seq mirroring) are broken—leads to overfills/misplacements; program too long/complex, with redundant loops (e.g., multiple 2/3/8 scans per row).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has inconsistencies like upper row 2 with 8,8 in cols 22-23 (unexpected, as input likely lacks triggering pair above); row 5/6 with 9s in cols 1-4 and 23-26 but asymmetric (left 4,9,9,9,9 vs right 9,9,9,9,4—mismatches expected symmetry); rows 7-8 have 1,1 in cols 5-6 and 20-21 but expected might be blanks or extended; lower rows 20-21 have 1,1 in cols 4-7 and partial in 19-20 (incomplete mirroring); row 23 has 1,1,1,1 in cols 4-7 but right has 1,1 in 19-20 (asymmetric); row 24 has 2,2,9s rightward but left 1s (suggests flawed doubling/rev_seq placement); row 25 has full 9s left and 3,3,8,8 right (over-extension or wrong which_u); row 26 has 8s/3s but sparse—overall, 9s trigger path but mirroring/doubling shifts wrong (e.g., start_col misaligned, num_rows=1<<idx over/under-places), and no-9 elements like 8-spreads leak in; doesn't match expected clean symmetry (mentally, test input seems 9-present with upper 8/3/2/9/1 patterns needing precise bottom-up doubling + right rev-seq for 3-4 uniques, but output has extras/misses like unpaired 9s and incomplete 8s downward).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid (with a central cross at row/column 13 filled with 1s) where patterns of numbers (1-9, with 4 as background/empty) in the upper-left 13x13 quadrant are transformed, mirrored, and propagated to the lower-right quadrant, incorporating rules for doubling sequences, reversals, special handling for 9s (which trigger unique row extraction and block-based filling), and conversions like isolated 2s to 8s or extending runs downward. The goal is to generate a symmetric or rule-compliant output grid that matches expected patterns, often involving partial mirroring, sequence expansion, and conditional filling based on the presence of 9s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is divided into quadrants: upper-left (rows 0-12, cols 0-12) provides source patterns; central row/column 13 is always a cross of 1s; lower-right (rows 14-26, cols 14-26) is filled by mirroring/reversing upper patterns, but not always fully symmetrically—partial or shifted placements occur based on sequence lengths.
 * Non-4 cells in upper rows are extracted as unique sequences (ignoring duplicates via seen set), with reversals applied to the right side (cols 14-26); sequences are sometimes doubled in length before placement, centered or shifted to align non-4 content.
 * If no 9s are present (has_nines=False), lower processing focuses on extending 2-runs rightward/leftward into adjacent 4s to create 3s, mirroring upper non-4s to lower-right, handling isolated 2s by placing 8s below them, and extending 8-runs downward into 4s.
 * If 9s are present (has_nines=True), use unique upper rows to define "blocks" of rows in the lower half (allocated via bit-shift num=1<<k, stacking from bottom up), fill each block with doubled versions of the unique row in left cols 0-12, then conditionally fill right cols 14+ with reversals (full for rows with 9s, partial for others, and special prev-block spillover at bottom).
 * Subtleties: Sequence doubling in get_doubled_sequence skips 4s, centers on non-4 content (shift = n_non4 // 2), and pads with 4s; upper processing mirrors sequences to the right via reversal starting at t_start=26-max_c; special upper fixes like clearing [18:22] to 4s if [5:9]==[2,2,3,3] and next row all 4s, or propagating 8s upward from below in paired columns; lower mirroring copies upper non-4s to symmetric lower-right positions (tr=26-r, tc=26-c); 8-runs extend leftward if adjacent to 4 and propagate downward; count non-4 rows but it's underused; always set lower row 13 to 1 in has_nine case.
 * Easy-to-miss: Reversals are only for contiguous non-4 sequences; partial lengths (e.g., len_r//2) for non-9 uniques; block allocation for 9s starts from row 26 downward (current=26, top=current-num+1); prev-block reversal spillover only at exact bottom row; isolated 2 check is single-cell (not run) and only if below is 4; upper pairs like (14,15) etc. are for specific 8-propagation from below.
 * All attempts must deepcopy input to avoid mutation; process upper before checking for 9s (since upper can introduce changes but not 9s); lower-right filling overwrites but respects existing 1s in col 13.

Partially helpful but over-applies or mispositions in some cases (e.g., doesn't handle all symmetries).
    # (Full code as in attempt; note: in-place, scans left-only for seqs.)
```

The other functions (process_lower_no_nine, process_lower_has_nine) are helpful in structure (e.g., extending 2s to 3s, mirroring via tr=26-r/tc=26-c, isolated 2->below 8, 8-run extensions) but buggy in execution (e.g., i=14 start for right-side scans assumes col 13 is 1/not 2; block_info allocation for 9s works but spillover and partial fills misalign; downward 8 extension assumes all-below-4 but doesn't check bounds fully).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt shown; both training examples failed despite complex logic attempting symmetry and 9-handling.
 * Train 1 (no 9s): Generated correctly set central cross and some upper mirroring (e.g., 8s in rows 3-5 cols 20-21 match expected), and lower 3,3,2,2 in rows 18-20 cols 16-21 partially match, but failed on: row 5 cols 18-21 has 4,4,2,2 instead of 3,3,2,2 (missed 3-extension?); row 6 cols 18-21 has 3,3,2,2 but expected 3,3,2,2 (match, but inconsistent); row 21 col 3=2/4=3 but expected 2,3; row 21 cols 19-21=8,8,8 but expected 4,4,4 (over-propagated 8s?); row 24-26 all 4s in lower but expected 8s in cols 19-21 (missed downward extension). Unknown why 3s missing in some 2-extensions.
 * Train 2 (has 9s): Generated upper mirroring partial (e.g., row 3 col 6=3 matches, row 4 cols 5-6=8,3 match, rows 5-6 9,2,2,1,1 match), central cross ok, but lower failed: row 20 cols 1-3=4,2,2 instead of 9,9,2 (missed block doubling/mirroring); row 21 cols 18-21=4,2,2,4 but expected 1,1,2,2,9 (wrong reversal/partial); row 22 matches expected but row 23 cols 18-21=1,1,2,2,9 match only partially; row 24 cols 4-7=8,8,3,3 match but row 25 cols 19=3 instead of 4 (extra prop?); row 26 all 4s but expected 4,4,3,3 (missed final block). Block allocation seems off for multi-uniques.
 * Overall: Captures core symmetry (26-r/c reversal) and 9-branching, but misfires on sequence extensions (2->3, 8 downward), partial fills in 9-case (e.g., len_r//2 too simplistic), and upper special cases (e.g., pairs propagate wrong). extract_uniques is essential and mostly correct (uniques list useful), get_doubled_sequence helpful but shift/first_non4 logic causes misalignment in doubling. process_upper's t_start/end positioning works for simple cases but not with gaps. No unhelpful functions, but process_lower_has_nine's block_info (bit-shift stacking) is overcomplicated and buggy for >2 uniques (current=top-1 overlaps?); the prev_k spillover only at bottom is specific but misapplied.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows inconsistencies similar to training failures, suggesting incomplete rule capture. Upper mirroring is partial (e.g., row 2 cols 22-23=8,8 but input has no clear source; row 3 cols 4-7=8,8,3,3 matches possible reversal of upper 3,3,8,8? but positions off); rows 5-6 have 9,9,9,9,2,2 which seems like doubled 9-run but expected likely more precise mirroring without extra 9s in col 0; row 7-8 have 1,1 in cols 5-6/20-21, possibly from upper 1s but input lacks them (over-propagation?); lower has row 20 empty-ish but expected 2-runs; row 21 has 1,1,1,1 in cols 4-7 but input/expected likely 1s only central; row 24 has 2,2,9,9,9,9 but asymmetric to upper 9s; row 27 (last) has 4,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3 which extends but doesn't mirror upper fully (e.g., no symmetric 8s above). It partially makes sense for 9-handling (doubled blocks visible) but fails symmetry (e.g., lower-left has 9s bleeding incorrectly, no clear isolated 2->8), and looks overfilled in places (extra 1s, 8s) while underfilling others (missing 3s from 2s). To handle test, need better block sizing for multiple 9-rows and precise reversal starts (e.g., start_col_r =14 + min_c).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (Train 1 and Train 2), below is a list of **obvious and consistent interactions/connections** observed across **both** train examples. These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., one property influencing another's transformation, position, or presence) in a consistent manner between input and output for every train pair. I focused only on patterns that hold true in **both** examples without exception, ignoring isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., unique one-off shapes like the single Red at [3,20,3,20] in Train 1, which does not appear or interact similarly in Train 2). No high-level solving or total puzzle understanding is included—only direct, observable linkages. Unknown or unexplainable transformations (e.g., exact pixel count changes in Yellow regions beyond shape overlaps) are noted as such.

Interactions are described as "Component A → Property of Component B" to highlight the connection, with evidence from consistency across trains.

1. **Blue cross lines (full-canvas overlay) → Unchanging positional framework for all quadrants**  
   - The Blue element (bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) remains identical in position, size, and properties across both inputs and outputs in Train 1 and Train 2.  
   - Interaction: It consistently divides the canvas into four Yellow quadrants, constraining all other colored shapes (e.g., Maroon, Green, Red) to quadrant-specific positions without overlapping or altering the Blue itself. No transformation of Blue occurs; it acts as a static "boundary" affecting placement of adjacent shapes.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (unchanged in input/output pairs).

2. **Yellow quadrant backgrounds (four regions) ↔ Pixel count adjustments from overlapping colored shapes**  
   - Four Yellow elements (holes=1, bboxes covering [0,0,12,12], [14,0,26,12], [0,14,12,26], [14,14,26,26]) are present in all inputs/outputs.  
   - Interaction: Pixel counts in each Yellow quadrant consistently change in outputs due to overlaps/additions of small colored shapes (e.g., Red, Green squares/bars) placed within their bboxes. For example, in both trains, bottom-left Yellow ([0,14,12,26]) pixel count decreases when new small shapes (e.g., Green/Red units) are added nearby, indicating direct area overlap effect. Exact mechanism of pixel adjustment is unknown (e.g., subtraction/addition rules not consistent beyond overlap presence).  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (all four Yellows present; pixel changes tied to shape placements in every pair).

3. **Small Red squares (2x2 units, pixels=4) in top-right quadrant upper edge → Static positional anchor unaffected by other transformations**  
   - Red (bbox=[20,5,21,6], pixels=4, holes=0) appears in the top-right quadrant ([14,0,26,12]) upper area.  
   - Interaction: This specific Red remains unchanged in position, color, size, and pixels across inputs and outputs in both trains, while nearby shapes (e.g., added Greens or Maroons) transform around it without affecting it. It acts as a "fixed point" that other color cycles (e.g., Green/Blue additions) reference for adjacency but do not alter.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (present and identical in all input/output pairs).

4. **Color-cycled polyomino components (Maroon → Green → Red → Blue sequence) in bottom-left quadrant → Mirrored positional duplication with color shift in top-right quadrant**  
   - In bottom-left quadrant ([0,14,12,26]), small adjacent units form partial polyominoes (e.g., Maroon [5,4,5,4 or similar], Red [5,5,6,6], Green/Blue bars pixels=2-4). Colors follow a partial cycle (Maroon-Green-Red-Blue).  
   - Interaction: In outputs, these consistently duplicate to symmetric positions in top-right quadrant ([14,0,26,12]), with a color shift forward in the cycle (e.g., Maroon → Green duplication at mirrored x/y coords like [20,3,21,4] in Train 1; similar Green/Red → Blue/Light Blue in Train 2 at [18,5,19,6] or [22,5,22,6]). Position mirroring is consistent (e.g., left-side x=4-8 maps to right-side x=18-22 via center symmetry at x=13). No rotation observed here—pure positional/color shift. Affects Yellow pixel counts in target quadrant via overlap.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (cycle-based duplication with color shift occurs in every input/output pair; sequence partial but always Maroon-influenced start).

5. **L-shaped or bar polyominoes (pixels=9-16, multi-unit Red/Green/Blue) in bottom-right lower area → Partial decomposition into smaller color-cycled units with positional spread**  
   - In bottom-right quadrant lower ([14,14,26,26], y=18+), larger Red/Green shapes (e.g., [19,18,21,20] pixels=9 in Train 1; [4,19,7,22] pixels=16 in Train 2, though latter is left but similar form).  
   - Interaction: In outputs, these consistently "decompose" into smaller units (pixels=1-9) spread horizontally/vertically within the same quadrant, with color cycle application (e.g., Red → Green/Maroon additions at adjacent positions like [16,18,18,20] Green in Train 1 or [17,20,18,21] Blue in Train 2). Position spreads consistently left/right from original bbox center (e.g., original x=19-21 spreads to x=16-21). Affects Yellow pixel counts via new overlaps; exact decomposition rule (e.g., why pixels=9 becomes two units) is unknown.  
   - Consistent in: Both trains (decomposition with color cycle and positional spread in every input/output pair).

### Notes on Scope and Limitations
- **No forced connections**: Elements like standalone single-pixel Reds (e.g., [3,20,3,20] in Train 1) or Light Blue in Train 2 only were excluded as they lack interaction or consistency across both trains (no equivalent in the other). Hole counts (always 0 for shapes, 1 for Yellows) do not interact or change consistently.
- **Unknowns called out**: Pixel count changes in Yellows are consistently tied to overlaps but cannot be explained beyond "addition of shapes reduces available Yellow pixels" (no consistent formula, e.g., Train 1 bottom-left drops by ~2, Train 2 by ~36). No consistent vertical mirroring observed (only horizontal/quadrant-specific). Color cycles are partial (not full purple-green-blue-red in every case) but always influence duplications.
- **Irrelevant elements ignored**: Background Yellow fills and Blue cross are foundational but only listed where they interact (e.g., constraining positions). No semantic meanings (e.g., "hook shapes") assumed beyond pixel/bbox data.
- This list is derived solely from the two train pairs; Test Input 1 was not used for identification as it lacks an output for verification. No solving attempted.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
