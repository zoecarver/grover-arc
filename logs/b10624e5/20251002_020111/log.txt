=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 02:01:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 02:19:02] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

def apply_left_right_symmetry(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    n = len(g)
    for i in range(n):
        left_non4 = []
        right_non4 = []
        for j in range(13):
            left_pos = g[i][j]
            right_pos = g[i][26 - j]
            if left_pos != 4:
                left_non4.append((j, left_pos))
            if right_pos != 4:
                right_non4.append((26 - j, right_pos))
        for j, color in left_non4:
            sym_j = 26 - j
            if g[i][sym_j] == 4:
                g[i][sym_j] = color
        for j, color in right_non4:
            sym_j = 26 - j
            if g[i][sym_j] == 4:
                g[i][sym_j] = color
    return g

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 02:22:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 28-row by 27-column grid partially filled with colors (integers 1-9 representing shapes or blobs) and 4's as empty/background spaces, featuring a fixed central column (index 13) and central row (index 13) filled with 1's forming a cross; the goal is to complete the grid by applying a symmetry-based rule across the central vertical axis to form coherent patterns or objects, likely mirroring or propagating colors for individual shapes while preserving some asymmetries or shifts in the final output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid symmetry is left-right around column 13 (pairs like column 0 with 26, 1 with 25, ..., 12 with 14), but the expected outputs are not fully symmetric overall—patterns appear mirrored within specific "objects" or blobs of the same color, but these blobs can be shifted vertically (e.g., by 1 row) between left and right sides, and some areas remain one-sided without a mirror.
 * Empty cells (4's) are filled only where they complete a symmetric object, but not blindly; if both symmetric positions are 4 in the input, the program must infer the color from context (e.g., adjacent rows or connected components), as the current attempt fails to do this and leaves them empty when expected has a color.
 * Conflicts occur when symmetric positions both have non-4 colors: the attempt leaves them unchanged, but expected resolves to a specific pattern (e.g., preferring a connected blob's color or reversing order for mirror effect), suggesting object-based completion rather than global overwrite.
 * Patterns involve connected same-color blobs (e.g., 8's forming a shape across 2-4 rows/columns, 2's and 3's forming reversed-mirror shapes like 2-2-3-3 on left matching 3-3-2-2 on right but shifted down by 1 row); subtle shifts and reversals are key, and blobs do not always straddle the center equally.
 * The central cross of 1's is invariant and not to be modified; colors do not propagate into or across the center unless part of a blob.
 * No horizontal symmetry is evident, but vertical shifts suggest possible interaction with the central row; objects seem "drawn" partially on left or right, requiring completion to a symmetric form without overfilling unrelated areas.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have isolated or partial blobs on one side (e.g., 3's appearing only on right without left mirror in some rows), indicating the rule completes only intended objects, not the entire grid; over-mirroring creates extras not in expected.
 * Input likely has sparse hints (some 4's on both sides of pairs), so the program must detect blobs (connected same-color groups, perhaps 4-connected or 8-connected) and extend them symmetrically if incomplete.
 * Row 13 (all 1's) and column 13 (all 1's) act as barriers or fixed elements; colors do not cross them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `make_grid_copy` using `deepcopy` is helpful for non-destructive processing. The `apply_left_right_symmetry` captures the core idea of pairing positions and filling 4's but is incomplete (see unhelpful below); it could be extended to detect blobs first.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

# Potential helpful extension: Extract connected components (blobs) of same color, ignoring 4's and 1's in center.
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Finds connected components (4-connected) of a given color, excluding center cross.
    Returns list of lists of (row, col) positions for each blob.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and not (j == 13 or i == 13):
                blob = []

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies non-4 colors to symmetric 4 positions in cases where only one side has the color (e.g., in training 1 row 4, 8's are filled on right to match left, appearing in generated as 8's on both sides at positions 5-6 left and 20-21 right, which aligns with expected).
 * It fails to fill positions where both symmetric spots are 4 in input but expected requires a color, indicating no inference of missing blob parts (e.g., in training 1 row 3, generated has all 4's on sides, but expected has 8's at right 20-21; likely input had 4's there, but context from adjacent rows demands filling).
 * In conflict cases (both sides non-4 but different), it preserves the input without resolution, leading to mismatches (e.g., training 1 row 5: generated keeps left 8's at 5-6 and right 2's at 20-21, but expected has left 8's at 5-6 and right 3's at 18-19 + 2's at 20-21, so missed filling 18-19 with 3's and didn't reverse/resolve the 8 vs. 2 conflict).
 * For training 1 row 6-7, generated correctly mirrors the 2's and 3's where possible (left 5-8 = 2,2,3,3 to right 18-21 = 3,3,2,2, matching the reversed pattern in expected), showing partial success for connected blobs without conflict.
 * In training 2 row 4-5, it mirrors 3's and 8's correctly in some pairs (e.g., position 6 left 3 to 20 right 3), but fails lower down (e.g., row 20 generated has symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but expected has extended 9's, 2's, and 1's only on left at 2-11, with partial on right in row 21-22, indicating over-mirroring unrelated areas).
 * Training 1 mismatches include missing one-sided fills (e.g., row 18-19 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 at 16-21 in expected, but generated likely left some as 4 if no left mirror); row 20 left adds 2 at 3 and 3 at 4 in expected without right mirror. Unknown why generated row 5 right has only 2's at 20-21 but misses 3's at 18-19—possibly input had 3's but code didn't propagate due to non-empty adjacent or range limit.
 * Training 2 mismatches: generated row 20-23 overfills symmetric 2's, but expected has asymmetric extension (e.g., row 20 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 but right all 4's; row 21 right partial 1,1,2,2,9); row 23-24 generated symmetric 3's/8's, but expected has them only on right or shifted.
 * The `apply_left_right_symmetry` function is partially helpful for pairing and filling empties but broken for conflicts and inference—it collects non-4's before modifying but doesn't overwrite non-4's or detect blobs for extension, leading to incomplete outputs; do not use as-is in future, but adapt for blob detection.
 * No other functions in the attempt; `deepcopy` is reliable but basic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it attempts full left-right mirroring by filling 4's (e.g., row 3 left 3-6=8,8,3,3 mirrored to right 20-23=3,3,8,8; row 4 adds 2's at right 18-20 and 8's at 21-22), creating a mostly symmetric grid, but expected likely follows the same partial, shifted, object-based completion as training (e.g., blobs like 9's in row 5-6 left 1-4=9's mirrored but reversed/shifted on right, with 2's at 5-7 both sides but not overfilled; 1's in row 7-8 at 5-6 both sides). 
 * It overfills symmetries where expected may leave one-sided (e.g., row 20-23 generated symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but test input patterns suggest asymmetric extensions like training 2 row 20); misses potential inferences for empty pairs (e.g., if input has partial 3's or 8's blobs, generated fills only existing mirrors, but expected would complete shifted blobs).
 * The output makes some sense for simple symmetry (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 at 1-4 left to 22-25 right, 2's connected), but looks too uniform/symmetric compared to training expecteds' partial/shifted blobs, suggesting it doesn't handle vertical shifts or object boundaries correctly—likely incorrect as it would fail similar to training cases with missing fills (e.g., if test has empty symmetric pairs needing context fill, they stay 4).

[2025-10-02 02:22:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 02:41:17] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def reflect_upper_right(grid: List[List[int]]):
  for r in range(13):
    for c in range(13):
      if grid[r][c] != 4:
        c2 = 26 - c
        if grid[r][c2] == 4:
          grid[r][c2] = grid[r][c]

def reflect_bottom_left(grid: List[List[int]]):
  for c in range(13):
    for r in range(13):
      if grid[r][c] != 4:
        r2 = 26 - r
        if grid[r2][c] == 4:
          grid[r2][c] = grid[r][c]

def reflect_bottom_right(grid: List[List[int]]):
  for r in range(13):
    for c in range(13):
      if grid[r][c] != 4:
        r2 = 26 - r
        c2 = 26 - c
        if grid[r2][c2] == 4:
          grid[r2][c2] = grid[r][c]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
  grid = copy.deepcopy(g)
  reflect_upper_right(grid)
  reflect_bottom_left(grid)
  reflect_bottom_right(grid)
  return grid

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

[2025-10-02 02:42:42] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (indices 0-26), where non-empty cells (values other than 4, which seems to represent blanks or empty space) in certain regions are propagated via reflections across the vertical midline, horizontal midline, and main diagonal to fill in corresponding blank cells in symmetric positions, resulting in a fully symmetric completed grid. The goal is to apply these reflections correctly in the right order or iterations to match the expected symmetric patterns in training examples, which include colored shapes (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, 9s) that mirror across quadrants while preserving a central row of 1s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 27x27, with row 13 (0-indexed) fixed as all 1s, acting as a central divider or axis that should not be altered.
 * Reflections are across three axes: vertical (columns symmetric around c=13), horizontal (rows symmetric around r=13), and diagonal (both r and c symmetric around 13), but the current implementation only partially fills blanks (4s) without ensuring full propagation or handling overlaps/multiple reflections per cell.
 * Only copy non-4 values to 4 positions; do not overwrite existing non-4 values, but the order of reflections matters—e.g., upper-right first may not propagate fully if later reflections depend on prior fills.
 * Subtlety: Reflections seem to be one-way (from source to target if target is 4), but may need to be bidirectional or repeated in loops until no changes occur, as partial fills in one step can enable further propagation.
 * Patterns represent shapes (e.g., blobs of 2s, 3s) that must mirror exactly, including size and position; mismatches occur when shapes are incomplete (e.g., missing extensions like three 2s instead of two, or incorrect positioning across the center).
 * The central row (all 1s) and column interactions: values near the center may need special handling to avoid overwriting the 1s row.
 * Grid has quadrants divided by the center lines; upper-left influences lower-right via diagonal, but current code doesn't fully symmetrize all pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs extend shapes horizontally or vertically across more cells (e.g., three 3s and three 2s in row 19-20 of training 1), suggesting reflections must propagate chains of values, not just single cells.
 * No rotation or other transformations; strictly reflections, and 4s are placeholders to be filled, not propagated themselves.
 * Potential for overfilling: If a cell gets filled multiple times from different reflections, it should stabilize to the correct value, but current code doesn't iterate.

# Note: This flood-fill could help verify symmetry by checking if shapes mirror across axes, but it's not used in the current program.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used three one-way reflection functions (upper-right vertical, bottom-left horizontal, bottom-right diagonal), applied sequentially without iteration, which partially filled some symmetric positions but failed to propagate full shapes (e.g., in training 1, generated two 2s where expected three, and misplaced 8s/3s in lower rows).
 * Worked: Correctly identified the three symmetry axes and conditional filling (only to 4s from non-4s), and preserved the central row of 1s; some upper-left patterns were mirrored to upper-right and bottom-left correctly (e.g., 8s in rows 4-5).
 * Did not work: Incomplete propagation—e.g., in training 1, row 19 expected three 2s and three 3s extending rightward, but generated only two; row 20 had incorrect 2 at col 3 instead of expected 2 at col 3 but missing extensions; diagonal reflection didn't fully mirror shapes across center (e.g., 8s in row 21-22 expected three-wide but generated two).
 * In training 2, generated partial mirrors (e.g., 2s and 9s in rows 5-6 mirrored somewhat, but row 20 had extra 2s where expected 9s/1s chain; row 23 had 3s/8s misplaced); failed to extend shapes like four 2s into proper symmetric blocks with 1s and 9s.
 * Order of reflections caused issues: upper-right first filled verticals prematurely, but horizontal/diagonal didn't update based on those changes, leading to asymmetries (e.g., unknown reason for 1s appearing in wrong positions in row 5 col 20-21 of training 2 generated vs. expected).
 * No iteration: Single pass per reflection means chained fills (e.g., a fill enabling another reflection) are missed.
 * Loops only over range(13) instead of 27, limiting to half-grid and missing bidirectional or full coverage.
 * Function reflect_upper_right is helpful for vertical symmetry but incomplete (one-way, half-range); similar for others—keep but extend to bidirectional and full range.
 * No shape extraction used, which might help debug by verifying mirrored blobs, but not essential yet.
 * Central row handling is correct (not overwritten), but interactions near row/col 13 are subtle and sometimes lead to partial fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially symmetrizes but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete shape extensions similar to training failures—e.g., row 4 has two 8s and two 3s mirrored to row 23, but expected likely needs three-wide for 2s/3s based on training patterns (row 4 generated: 8,8,3,3 but test input suggests larger blobs); row 5 has two 2s where patterns imply more.
 * In rows 5-6, 9s and 2s are mirrored vertically and diagonally, but only two 2s each instead of potentially three or four to match shape completeness seen in expected trainings; 1s in rows 7-8 and 19-20 appear symmetric but isolated, possibly missing connections to central patterns.
 * Lower half (rows 19-24) has partial mirrors (e.g., row 21 two 2s, row 23 two 8s/3s), but asymmetries like row 4's 8s/3s not fully propagating to row 23's expected extended form; overall, it looks like 70% symmetric but misses chain propagations, making it incorrect without expected to confirm, but inconsistent with training expectations for full shape mirroring.
 * The output preserves the central 1s row correctly, which is good, but fails to handle larger blobs (e.g., four 9s in row 6 not fully mirrored horizontally in lower rows).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 02:42:42] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 28-row by 27-column grid partially filled with colors (integers 1-9 representing shapes or blobs) and 4's as empty/background spaces, featuring a fixed central column (index 13) and central row (index 13) filled with 1's forming a cross; the goal is to complete the grid by applying a symmetry-based rule across the central vertical axis to form coherent patterns or objects, likely mirroring or propagating colors for individual shapes while preserving some asymmetries or shifts in the final output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid symmetry is left-right around column 13 (pairs like column 0 with 26, 1 with 25, ..., 12 with 14), but the expected outputs are not fully symmetric overall—patterns appear mirrored within specific "objects" or blobs of the same color, but these blobs can be shifted vertically (e.g., by 1 row) between left and right sides, and some areas remain one-sided without a mirror.
 * Empty cells (4's) are filled only where they complete a symmetric object, but not blindly; if both symmetric positions are 4 in the input, the program must infer the color from context (e.g., adjacent rows or connected components), as the current attempt fails to do this and leaves them empty when expected has a color.
 * Conflicts occur when symmetric positions both have non-4 colors: the attempt leaves them unchanged, but expected resolves to a specific pattern (e.g., preferring a connected blob's color or reversing order for mirror effect), suggesting object-based completion rather than global overwrite.
 * Patterns involve connected same-color blobs (e.g., 8's forming a shape across 2-4 rows/columns, 2's and 3's forming reversed-mirror shapes like 2-2-3-3 on left matching 3-3-2-2 on right but shifted down by 1 row); subtle shifts and reversals are key, and blobs do not always straddle the center equally.
 * The central cross of 1's is invariant and not to be modified; colors do not propagate into or across the center unless part of a blob.
 * No horizontal symmetry is evident, but vertical shifts suggest possible interaction with the central row; objects seem "drawn" partially on left or right, requiring completion to a symmetric form without overfilling unrelated areas.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have isolated or partial blobs on one side (e.g., 3's appearing only on right without left mirror in some rows), indicating the rule completes only intended objects, not the entire grid; over-mirroring creates extras not in expected.
 * Input likely has sparse hints (some 4's on both sides of pairs), so the program must detect blobs (connected same-color groups, perhaps 4-connected or 8-connected) and extend them symmetrically if incomplete.
 * Row 13 (all 1's) and column 13 (all 1's) act as barriers or fixed elements; colors do not cross them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `make_grid_copy` using `deepcopy` is helpful for non-destructive processing. The `apply_left_right_symmetry` captures the core idea of pairing positions and filling 4's but is incomplete (see unhelpful below); it could be extended to detect blobs first.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

# Potential helpful extension: Extract connected components (blobs) of same color, ignoring 4's and 1's in center.
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Finds connected components (4-connected) of a given color, excluding center cross.
    Returns list of lists of (row, col) positions for each blob.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and not (j == 13 or i == 13):
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and not (ny == 13 or nx == 13):
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies non-4 colors to symmetric 4 positions in cases where only one side has the color (e.g., in training 1 row 4, 8's are filled on right to match left, appearing in generated as 8's on both sides at positions 5-6 left and 20-21 right, which aligns with expected).
 * It fails to fill positions where both symmetric spots are 4 in input but expected requires a color, indicating no inference of missing blob parts (e.g., in training 1 row 3, generated has all 4's on sides, but expected has 8's at right 20-21; likely input had 4's there, but context from adjacent rows demands filling).
 * In conflict cases (both sides non-4 but different), it preserves the input without resolution, leading to mismatches (e.g., training 1 row 5: generated keeps left 8's at 5-6 and right 2's at 20-21, but expected has left 8's at 5-6 and right 3's at 18-19 + 2's at 20-21, so missed filling 18-19 with 3's and didn't reverse/resolve the 8 vs. 2 conflict).
 * For training 1 row 6-7, generated correctly mirrors the 2's and 3's where possible (left 5-8 = 2,2,3,3 to right 18-21 = 3,3,2,2, matching the reversed pattern in expected), showing partial success for connected blobs without conflict.
 * In training 2 row 4-5, it mirrors 3's and 8's correctly in some pairs (e.g., position 6 left 3 to 20 right 3), but fails lower down (e.g., row 20 generated has symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but expected has extended 9's, 2's, and 1's only on left at 2-11, with partial on right in row 21-22, indicating over-mirroring unrelated areas).
 * Training 1 mismatches include missing one-sided fills (e.g., row 18-19 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 at 16-21 in expected, but generated likely left some as 4 if no left mirror); row 20 left adds 2 at 3 and 3 at 4 in expected without right mirror. Unknown why generated row 5 right has only 2's at 20-21 but misses 3's at 18-19—possibly input had 3's but code didn't propagate due to non-empty adjacent or range limit.
 * Training 2 mismatches: generated row 20-23 overfills symmetric 2's, but expected has asymmetric extension (e.g., row 20 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 but right all 4's; row 21 right partial 1,1,2,2,9); row 23-24 generated symmetric 3's/8's, but expected has them only on right or shifted.
 * The `apply_left_right_symmetry` function is partially helpful for pairing and filling empties but broken for conflicts and inference—it collects non-4's before modifying but doesn't overwrite non-4's or detect blobs for extension, leading to incomplete outputs; do not use as-is in future, but adapt for blob detection.
 * No other functions in the attempt; `deepcopy` is reliable but basic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it attempts full left-right mirroring by filling 4's (e.g., row 3 left 3-6=8,8,3,3 mirrored to right 20-23=3,3,8,8; row 4 adds 2's at right 18-20 and 8's at 21-22), creating a mostly symmetric grid, but expected likely follows the same partial, shifted, object-based completion as training (e.g., blobs like 9's in row 5-6 left 1-4=9's mirrored but reversed/shifted on right, with 2's at 5-7 both sides but not overfilled; 1's in row 7-8 at 5-6 both sides). 
 * It overfills symmetries where expected may leave one-sided (e.g., row 20-23 generated symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but test input patterns suggest asymmetric extensions like training 2 row 20); misses potential inferences for empty pairs (e.g., if input has partial 3's or 8's blobs, generated fills only existing mirrors, but expected would complete shifted blobs).
 * The output makes some sense for simple symmetry (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 at 1-4 left to 22-25 right, 2's connected), but looks too uniform/symmetric compared to training expecteds' partial/shifted blobs, suggesting it doesn't handle vertical shifts or object boundaries correctly—likely incorrect as it would fail similar to training cases with missing fills (e.g., if test has empty symmetric pairs needing context fill, they stay 4).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (indices 0-26), where non-empty cells (values other than 4, which seems to represent blanks or empty space) in certain regions are propagated via reflections across the vertical midline, horizontal midline, and main diagonal to fill in corresponding blank cells in symmetric positions, resulting in a fully symmetric completed grid. The goal is to apply these reflections correctly in the right order or iterations to match the expected symmetric patterns in training examples, which include colored shapes (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, 9s) that mirror across quadrants while preserving a central row of 1s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 27x27, with row 13 (0-indexed) fixed as all 1s, acting as a central divider or axis that should not be altered.

 * Only copy non-4 values to 4 positions; do not overwrite existing non-4 values, but the order of reflections matters—e.g., upper-right first may not propagate fully if later reflections depend on prior fills.
 * Subtlety: Reflections seem to be one-way (from source to target if target is 4), but may need to be bidirectional or repeated in loops until no changes occur, as partial fills in one step can enable further propagation.

# Note: This flood-fill could help verify symmetry by checking if shapes mirror across axes, but it's not used in the current program.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used three one-way reflection functions (upper-right vertical, bottom-left horizontal, bottom-right diagonal), applied sequentially without iteration, which partially filled some symmetric positions but failed to propagate full shapes (e.g., in training 1, generated two 2s where expected three, and misplaced 8s/3s in lower rows).
 * Worked: Correctly identified the three symmetry axes and conditional filling (only to 4s from non-4s), and preserved the central row of 1s; some upper-left patterns were mirrored to upper-right and bottom-left correctly (e.g., 8s in rows 4-5).
 * Did not work: Incomplete propagation—e.g., in training 1, row 19 expected three 2s and three 3s extending rightward, but generated only two; row 20 had incorrect 2 at col 3 instead of expected 2 at col 3 but missing extensions; diagonal reflection didn't fully mirror shapes across center (e.g., 8s in row 21-22 expected three-wide but generated two).
 * In training 2, generated partial mirrors (e.g., 2s and 9s in rows 5-6 mirrored somewhat, but row 20 had extra 2s where expected 9s/1s chain; row 23 had 3s/8s misplaced); failed to extend shapes like four 2s into proper symmetric blocks with 1s and 9s.
 * Order of reflections caused issues: upper-right first filled verticals prematurely, but horizontal/diagonal didn't update based on those changes, leading to asymmetries (e.g., unknown reason for 1s appearing in wrong positions in row 5 col 20-21 of training 2 generated vs. expected).
 * No iteration: Single pass per reflection means chained fills (e.g., a fill enabling another reflection) are missed.
 * Loops only over range(13) instead of 27, limiting to half-grid and missing bidirectional or full coverage.
 * Function reflect_upper_right is helpful for vertical symmetry but incomplete (one-way, half-range); similar for others—keep but extend to bidirectional and full range.
 * No shape extraction used, which might help debug by verifying mirrored blobs, but not essential yet.
 * Central row handling is correct (not overwritten), but interactions near row/col 13 are subtle and sometimes lead to partial fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially symmetrizes but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete shape extensions similar to training failures—e.g., row 4 has two 8s and two 3s mirrored to row 23, but expected likely needs three-wide for 2s/3s based on training patterns (row 4 generated: 8,8,3,3 but test input suggests larger blobs); row 5 has two 2s where patterns imply more.
 * In rows 5-6, 9s and 2s are mirrored vertically and diagonally, but only two 2s each instead of potentially three or four to match shape completeness seen in expected trainings; 1s in rows 7-8 and 19-20 appear symmetric but isolated, possibly missing connections to central patterns.
 * Lower half (rows 19-24) has partial mirrors (e.g., row 21 two 2s, row 23 two 8s/3s), but asymmetries like row 4's 8s/3s not fully propagating to row 23's expected extended form; overall, it looks like 70% symmetric but misses chain propagations, making it incorrect without expected to confirm, but inconsistent with training expectations for full shape mirroring.
 * The output preserves the central 1s row correctly, which is good, but fails to handle larger blobs (e.g., four 9s in row 6 not fully mirrored horizontally in lower rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:09:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid divided by central lines at row 13 and column 13, where patterns (sequences or "blobs" of numbers representing colors like 1,2,3,8,9) on the left side (columns 0-12) are mirrored, extended, or transformed to the right side (columns 14-26) and sometimes downward, following rules for symmetry, continuations from above rows, prefixing runs of 2's with 3's, and adding blocks of 8's below certain 2-blobs, while leaving 4's as empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed dividers: all of row 13 and column 13 are filled with 1's, and patterns do not cross these lines (e.g., blobs skip column 13 and row 13 in extraction).
 * Mirroring from left to right applies to sequences of non-4 cells in a row, but only if they are not exact continuations of the same sequence from the row above (to avoid over-mirroring vertical stacks); reversed sequences are placed starting from the symmetric position on the right (e.g., for a sequence ending at column j on left, mirror starts at 26 - (j- something)).
 * For runs of 2's on the right side (columns 14+), if length >=2, prefix them with an equal-length run of 3's immediately to the left (in columns 13+), but only fill 4's without conflicts.
 * Below blobs of 2's (connected components, ignoring dividers), add vertical extensions of 8's in the rows immediately below the blob's bottom row, matching the blob's horizontal width, but only in empty (4) cells; also handle partial fills like a single 8 at specific positions (e.g., column 3 in the first extension row).
 * Complete partial extensions: if a 2 on the left (columns 0-12) is followed by a 4 to its right, fill that 4 with 3 (suggesting a "partial left two" rule for incomplete mirrors).
 * Subtlety: For uniform-color sequences (all same number) of length >=2 (except color 1), if not a continuation, extend upward into the previous row's mirror area if empty.
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same color, excluding divider cells; only blobs with size >1 are considered for extensions.
 * Conflicts in mirroring: if a mirror position already has a non-4 that doesn't match the expected reversed value, skip filling; partial matches (some cells already correct) may still allow filling the rest.
 * Order of operations matters: mirroring first, then completing 2-runs with 3-prefixes, then adding 8-blocks below 2-blobs, then partial left completions.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side patterns can influence left-side fills (e.g., 3-prefixes extend leftward into column 14- but wait, code has i=14, filling left to c=i-1-p >=14? Wait, seems buggy); also, 9's and other colors like 1's may have special non-mirroring behavior.
 * Vertical influences: Check for continuations only upward (r-1), not downward; 8-extensions are strictly below and don't mirror.
 * Grid is 27 rows x 27 cols, but patterns are sparse; row 13 is all 1's, column 13 all 1's in output.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented mirroring of left sequences to right (reversed), but skipped fills too aggressively on continuations and conflicts, leading to incomplete right-side patterns in both training examples.
 * Worked: Basic mirroring for non-continuation sequences (e.g., in training 1, correctly placed some 8's below and 2's/3's on right); extracted 2-blobs correctly for 8-extensions in some positions (e.g., rows 20-22 in training 1 match expected 8's).
 * Didn't work: In training 1, row 5 (0-indexed) generated [3,3,2,2] starting at col 19 but expected starts at col 18 with [3,3,2,2]; also added extra 2 at row 20 col 23 which expected lacks; row 6 has correct but overall mismatches in 3-prefix positioning.
 * In training 1, failed to prefix 2-runs with 3's correctly in rows 18-19 (generated correct, but row 20 has misplaced 2/3); also added 8 at row 3 col 20-21 which expected has, but extra 8's elsewhere.
 * In training 2, mirroring introduced incorrect 3's and 8's in left side (e.g., row 3 col 6=3 but expected 4? Wait, expected has 3 at row 3 col 20); over-extended 8-blocks to width 4 in rows 23-26 but expected varies (e.g., row 23 has 8's at col 19-22, but generated has at 19-22 correctly? Wait, mismatches in row 20-22 with extra 2's and 3's on left).
 * In training 2, complete_two_runs_with_three_prefix filled 3's leftward from right 2's but started at i=14 and filled to c>=14, which is buggy (should fill into left? But code fills left from i, yet i=14 is right side); led to no fills in some prefix spots.
 * add_eight_block_below_two_blob worked partially (added 8's below 2-blobs in right side), but over-added vertically (e.g., in training 2, extended to row 26 but expected stops earlier) and added partial 8 at col 3 incorrectly or missed.
 * complete_partial_left_two only checked cols 0-12 for 2 followed by 4, filling with 3, but missed cases where partials are deeper or on right.
 * extract_blobs is helpful and correct for finding connected 2-groups, but only used for color=2; could extend to other colors.
 * mirror_left_to_right has logic for uniform color upward extension, but condition "all(x == sequence[0] for x in sequence) and sequence[0] != 1" skipped color=1 correctly but over-applied for 2's in some vertical stacks.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of mirroring and blob extensions but bugs in prefixing (wrong starting columns, conflicts), over-filling 8's, and missing subtle position shifts (e.g., 3-prefixes start one column left of 2-run).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors left patterns to right (e.g., row 3: left 8,8,3,3 -> right 3,3,8,8 correctly reversed; row 5-6: 9's and 2's mirrored with length 4 each), adds 8's below 2-blobs in rows 23-26 cols 19-22, and prefixes some 3's before 2's in rows 20-22 cols 14-19.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4, right side has 2,2,2 at cols 19-21 but no 3-prefix before them (expected likely 3's at cols 16-18 or similar based on training patterns); row 7-8 have 1,1 on right but left has 1,1 at cols 5-6, suggesting incomplete mirroring or continuation skip error.
 * Row 20-22: 3's and 2's prefixed correctly on right, but row 22 has 2,3 on left cols 5-6 which seems like a partial fill error (complete_partial_left_two may have over-applied); expected likely no left changes there.
 * 8-block in rows 23-26 cols 19-22 looks correct for below 2's in row 19? But test input not shown, assuming based on patterns—partial 8 at row 23 col 4? Code has no such fill, but earlier partial rule mentions col 3.
 * Missing upward extensions for uniform sequences (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 might need upward if applicable); overall, test output has more fills than expected in left partials and incomplete prefixes, suggesting same prefix bug as training.

[2025-10-02 03:09:45] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 28-row by 27-column grid partially filled with colors (integers 1-9 representing shapes or blobs) and 4's as empty/background spaces, featuring a fixed central column (index 13) and central row (index 13) filled with 1's forming a cross; the goal is to complete the grid by applying a symmetry-based rule across the central vertical axis to form coherent patterns or objects, likely mirroring or propagating colors for individual shapes while preserving some asymmetries or shifts in the final output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid symmetry is left-right around column 13 (pairs like column 0 with 26, 1 with 25, ..., 12 with 14), but the expected outputs are not fully symmetric overall—patterns appear mirrored within specific "objects" or blobs of the same color, but these blobs can be shifted vertically (e.g., by 1 row) between left and right sides, and some areas remain one-sided without a mirror.
 * Empty cells (4's) are filled only where they complete a symmetric object, but not blindly; if both symmetric positions are 4 in the input, the program must infer the color from context (e.g., adjacent rows or connected components), as the current attempt fails to do this and leaves them empty when expected has a color.
 * Conflicts occur when symmetric positions both have non-4 colors: the attempt leaves them unchanged, but expected resolves to a specific pattern (e.g., preferring a connected blob's color or reversing order for mirror effect), suggesting object-based completion rather than global overwrite.
 * Patterns involve connected same-color blobs (e.g., 8's forming a shape across 2-4 rows/columns, 2's and 3's forming reversed-mirror shapes like 2-2-3-3 on left matching 3-3-2-2 on right but shifted down by 1 row); subtle shifts and reversals are key, and blobs do not always straddle the center equally.
 * The central cross of 1's is invariant and not to be modified; colors do not propagate into or across the center unless part of a blob.
 * No horizontal symmetry is evident, but vertical shifts suggest possible interaction with the central row; objects seem "drawn" partially on left or right, requiring completion to a symmetric form without overfilling unrelated areas.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have isolated or partial blobs on one side (e.g., 3's appearing only on right without left mirror in some rows), indicating the rule completes only intended objects, not the entire grid; over-mirroring creates extras not in expected.
 * Input likely has sparse hints (some 4's on both sides of pairs), so the program must detect blobs (connected same-color groups, perhaps 4-connected or 8-connected) and extend them symmetrically if incomplete.
 * Row 13 (all 1's) and column 13 (all 1's) act as barriers or fixed elements; colors do not cross them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `make_grid_copy` using `deepcopy` is helpful for non-destructive processing. The `apply_left_right_symmetry` captures the core idea of pairing positions and filling 4's but is incomplete (see unhelpful below); it could be extended to detect blobs first.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

# Potential helpful extension: Extract connected components (blobs) of same color, ignoring 4's and 1's in center.
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Finds connected components (4-connected) of a given color, excluding center cross.
    Returns list of lists of (row, col) positions for each blob.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and not (j == 13 or i == 13):
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and not (ny == 13 or nx == 13):
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies non-4 colors to symmetric 4 positions in cases where only one side has the color (e.g., in training 1 row 4, 8's are filled on right to match left, appearing in generated as 8's on both sides at positions 5-6 left and 20-21 right, which aligns with expected).
 * It fails to fill positions where both symmetric spots are 4 in input but expected requires a color, indicating no inference of missing blob parts (e.g., in training 1 row 3, generated has all 4's on sides, but expected has 8's at right 20-21; likely input had 4's there, but context from adjacent rows demands filling).
 * In conflict cases (both sides non-4 but different), it preserves the input without resolution, leading to mismatches (e.g., training 1 row 5: generated keeps left 8's at 5-6 and right 2's at 20-21, but expected has left 8's at 5-6 and right 3's at 18-19 + 2's at 20-21, so missed filling 18-19 with 3's and didn't reverse/resolve the 8 vs. 2 conflict).
 * For training 1 row 6-7, generated correctly mirrors the 2's and 3's where possible (left 5-8 = 2,2,3,3 to right 18-21 = 3,3,2,2, matching the reversed pattern in expected), showing partial success for connected blobs without conflict.
 * In training 2 row 4-5, it mirrors 3's and 8's correctly in some pairs (e.g., position 6 left 3 to 20 right 3), but fails lower down (e.g., row 20 generated has symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but expected has extended 9's, 2's, and 1's only on left at 2-11, with partial on right in row 21-22, indicating over-mirroring unrelated areas).
 * Training 1 mismatches include missing one-sided fills (e.g., row 18-19 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 at 16-21 in expected, but generated likely left some as 4 if no left mirror); row 20 left adds 2 at 3 and 3 at 4 in expected without right mirror. Unknown why generated row 5 right has only 2's at 20-21 but misses 3's at 18-19—possibly input had 3's but code didn't propagate due to non-empty adjacent or range limit.
 * Training 2 mismatches: generated row 20-23 overfills symmetric 2's, but expected has asymmetric extension (e.g., row 20 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 but right all 4's; row 21 right partial 1,1,2,2,9); row 23-24 generated symmetric 3's/8's, but expected has them only on right or shifted.
 * The `apply_left_right_symmetry` function is partially helpful for pairing and filling empties but broken for conflicts and inference—it collects non-4's before modifying but doesn't overwrite non-4's or detect blobs for extension, leading to incomplete outputs; do not use as-is in future, but adapt for blob detection.
 * No other functions in the attempt; `deepcopy` is reliable but basic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it attempts full left-right mirroring by filling 4's (e.g., row 3 left 3-6=8,8,3,3 mirrored to right 20-23=3,3,8,8; row 4 adds 2's at right 18-20 and 8's at 21-22), creating a mostly symmetric grid, but expected likely follows the same partial, shifted, object-based completion as training (e.g., blobs like 9's in row 5-6 left 1-4=9's mirrored but reversed/shifted on right, with 2's at 5-7 both sides but not overfilled; 1's in row 7-8 at 5-6 both sides). 
 * It overfills symmetries where expected may leave one-sided (e.g., row 20-23 generated symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but test input patterns suggest asymmetric extensions like training 2 row 20); misses potential inferences for empty pairs (e.g., if input has partial 3's or 8's blobs, generated fills only existing mirrors, but expected would complete shifted blobs).
 * The output makes some sense for simple symmetry (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 at 1-4 left to 22-25 right, 2's connected), but looks too uniform/symmetric compared to training expecteds' partial/shifted blobs, suggesting it doesn't handle vertical shifts or object boundaries correctly—likely incorrect as it would fail similar to training cases with missing fills (e.g., if test has empty symmetric pairs needing context fill, they stay 4).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (indices 0-26), where non-empty cells (values other than 4, which seems to represent blanks or empty space) in certain regions are propagated via reflections across the vertical midline, horizontal midline, and main diagonal to fill in corresponding blank cells in symmetric positions, resulting in a fully symmetric completed grid. The goal is to apply these reflections correctly in the right order or iterations to match the expected symmetric patterns in training examples, which include colored shapes (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, 9s) that mirror across quadrants while preserving a central row of 1s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 27x27, with row 13 (0-indexed) fixed as all 1s, acting as a central divider or axis that should not be altered.
 * Reflections are across three axes: vertical (columns symmetric around c=13), horizontal (rows symmetric around r=13), and diagonal (both r and c symmetric around 13), but the current implementation only partially fills blanks (4s) without ensuring full propagation or handling overlaps/multiple reflections per cell.
 * Only copy non-4 values to 4 positions; do not overwrite existing non-4 values, but the order of reflections matters—e.g., upper-right first may not propagate fully if later reflections depend on prior fills.
 * Subtlety: Reflections seem to be one-way (from source to target if target is 4), but may need to be bidirectional or repeated in loops until no changes occur, as partial fills in one step can enable further propagation.
 * Patterns represent shapes (e.g., blobs of 2s, 3s) that must mirror exactly, including size and position; mismatches occur when shapes are incomplete (e.g., missing extensions like three 2s instead of two, or incorrect positioning across the center).
 * The central row (all 1s) and column interactions: values near the center may need special handling to avoid overwriting the 1s row.
 * Grid has quadrants divided by the center lines; upper-left influences lower-right via diagonal, but current code doesn't fully symmetrize all pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs extend shapes horizontally or vertically across more cells (e.g., three 3s and three 2s in row 19-20 of training 1), suggesting reflections must propagate chains of values, not just single cells.
 * No rotation or other transformations; strictly reflections, and 4s are placeholders to be filled, not propagated themselves.
 * Potential for overfilling: If a cell gets filled multiple times from different reflections, it should stabilize to the correct value, but current code doesn't iterate.

                # Simple flood-fill to group connected components (assuming 4-connectivity)

    return list(shapes.values())
```
# Note: This flood-fill could help verify symmetry by checking if shapes mirror across axes, but it's not used in the current program.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used three one-way reflection functions (upper-right vertical, bottom-left horizontal, bottom-right diagonal), applied sequentially without iteration, which partially filled some symmetric positions but failed to propagate full shapes (e.g., in training 1, generated two 2s where expected three, and misplaced 8s/3s in lower rows).
 * Worked: Correctly identified the three symmetry axes and conditional filling (only to 4s from non-4s), and preserved the central row of 1s; some upper-left patterns were mirrored to upper-right and bottom-left correctly (e.g., 8s in rows 4-5).
 * Did not work: Incomplete propagation—e.g., in training 1, row 19 expected three 2s and three 3s extending rightward, but generated only two; row 20 had incorrect 2 at col 3 instead of expected 2 at col 3 but missing extensions; diagonal reflection didn't fully mirror shapes across center (e.g., 8s in row 21-22 expected three-wide but generated two).
 * In training 2, generated partial mirrors (e.g., 2s and 9s in rows 5-6 mirrored somewhat, but row 20 had extra 2s where expected 9s/1s chain; row 23 had 3s/8s misplaced); failed to extend shapes like four 2s into proper symmetric blocks with 1s and 9s.
 * Order of reflections caused issues: upper-right first filled verticals prematurely, but horizontal/diagonal didn't update based on those changes, leading to asymmetries (e.g., unknown reason for 1s appearing in wrong positions in row 5 col 20-21 of training 2 generated vs. expected).
 * No iteration: Single pass per reflection means chained fills (e.g., a fill enabling another reflection) are missed.
 * Loops only over range(13) instead of 27, limiting to half-grid and missing bidirectional or full coverage.
 * Function reflect_upper_right is helpful for vertical symmetry but incomplete (one-way, half-range); similar for others—keep but extend to bidirectional and full range.
 * No shape extraction used, which might help debug by verifying mirrored blobs, but not essential yet.
 * Central row handling is correct (not overwritten), but interactions near row/col 13 are subtle and sometimes lead to partial fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially symmetrizes but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete shape extensions similar to training failures—e.g., row 4 has two 8s and two 3s mirrored to row 23, but expected likely needs three-wide for 2s/3s based on training patterns (row 4 generated: 8,8,3,3 but test input suggests larger blobs); row 5 has two 2s where patterns imply more.
 * In rows 5-6, 9s and 2s are mirrored vertically and diagonally, but only two 2s each instead of potentially three or four to match shape completeness seen in expected trainings; 1s in rows 7-8 and 19-20 appear symmetric but isolated, possibly missing connections to central patterns.
 * Lower half (rows 19-24) has partial mirrors (e.g., row 21 two 2s, row 23 two 8s/3s), but asymmetries like row 4's 8s/3s not fully propagating to row 23's expected extended form; overall, it looks like 70% symmetric but misses chain propagations, making it incorrect without expected to confirm, but inconsistent with training expectations for full shape mirroring.
 * The output preserves the central 1s row correctly, which is good, but fails to handle larger blobs (e.g., four 9s in row 6 not fully mirrored horizontally in lower rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid divided by central lines at row 13 and column 13, where patterns (sequences or "blobs" of numbers representing colors like 1,2,3,8,9) on the left side (columns 0-12) are mirrored, extended, or transformed to the right side (columns 14-26) and sometimes downward, following rules for symmetry, continuations from above rows, prefixing runs of 2's with 3's, and adding blocks of 8's below certain 2-blobs, while leaving 4's as empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed dividers: all of row 13 and column 13 are filled with 1's, and patterns do not cross these lines (e.g., blobs skip column 13 and row 13 in extraction).
 * Mirroring from left to right applies to sequences of non-4 cells in a row, but only if they are not exact continuations of the same sequence from the row above (to avoid over-mirroring vertical stacks); reversed sequences are placed starting from the symmetric position on the right (e.g., for a sequence ending at column j on left, mirror starts at 26 - (j- something)).
 * For runs of 2's on the right side (columns 14+), if length >=2, prefix them with an equal-length run of 3's immediately to the left (in columns 13+), but only fill 4's without conflicts.
 * Below blobs of 2's (connected components, ignoring dividers), add vertical extensions of 8's in the rows immediately below the blob's bottom row, matching the blob's horizontal width, but only in empty (4) cells; also handle partial fills like a single 8 at specific positions (e.g., column 3 in the first extension row).
 * Complete partial extensions: if a 2 on the left (columns 0-12) is followed by a 4 to its right, fill that 4 with 3 (suggesting a "partial left two" rule for incomplete mirrors).
 * Subtlety: For uniform-color sequences (all same number) of length >=2 (except color 1), if not a continuation, extend upward into the previous row's mirror area if empty.
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same color, excluding divider cells; only blobs with size >1 are considered for extensions.
 * Conflicts in mirroring: if a mirror position already has a non-4 that doesn't match the expected reversed value, skip filling; partial matches (some cells already correct) may still allow filling the rest.
 * Order of operations matters: mirroring first, then completing 2-runs with 3-prefixes, then adding 8-blocks below 2-blobs, then partial left completions.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side patterns can influence left-side fills (e.g., 3-prefixes extend leftward into column 14- but wait, code has i=14, filling left to c=i-1-p >=14? Wait, seems buggy); also, 9's and other colors like 1's may have special non-mirroring behavior.
 * Vertical influences: Check for continuations only upward (r-1), not downward; 8-extensions are strictly below and don't mirror.
 * Grid is 27 rows x 27 cols, but patterns are sparse; row 13 is all 1's, column 13 all 1's in output.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented mirroring of left sequences to right (reversed), but skipped fills too aggressively on continuations and conflicts, leading to incomplete right-side patterns in both training examples.
 * Worked: Basic mirroring for non-continuation sequences (e.g., in training 1, correctly placed some 8's below and 2's/3's on right); extracted 2-blobs correctly for 8-extensions in some positions (e.g., rows 20-22 in training 1 match expected 8's).
 * Didn't work: In training 1, row 5 (0-indexed) generated [3,3,2,2] starting at col 19 but expected starts at col 18 with [3,3,2,2]; also added extra 2 at row 20 col 23 which expected lacks; row 6 has correct but overall mismatches in 3-prefix positioning.
 * In training 1, failed to prefix 2-runs with 3's correctly in rows 18-19 (generated correct, but row 20 has misplaced 2/3); also added 8 at row 3 col 20-21 which expected has, but extra 8's elsewhere.
 * In training 2, mirroring introduced incorrect 3's and 8's in left side (e.g., row 3 col 6=3 but expected 4? Wait, expected has 3 at row 3 col 20); over-extended 8-blocks to width 4 in rows 23-26 but expected varies (e.g., row 23 has 8's at col 19-22, but generated has at 19-22 correctly? Wait, mismatches in row 20-22 with extra 2's and 3's on left).
 * In training 2, complete_two_runs_with_three_prefix filled 3's leftward from right 2's but started at i=14 and filled to c>=14, which is buggy (should fill into left? But code fills left from i, yet i=14 is right side); led to no fills in some prefix spots.
 * add_eight_block_below_two_blob worked partially (added 8's below 2-blobs in right side), but over-added vertically (e.g., in training 2, extended to row 26 but expected stops earlier) and added partial 8 at col 3 incorrectly or missed.
 * complete_partial_left_two only checked cols 0-12 for 2 followed by 4, filling with 3, but missed cases where partials are deeper or on right.
 * extract_blobs is helpful and correct for finding connected 2-groups, but only used for color=2; could extend to other colors.
 * mirror_left_to_right has logic for uniform color upward extension, but condition "all(x == sequence[0] for x in sequence) and sequence[0] != 1" skipped color=1 correctly but over-applied for 2's in some vertical stacks.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of mirroring and blob extensions but bugs in prefixing (wrong starting columns, conflicts), over-filling 8's, and missing subtle position shifts (e.g., 3-prefixes start one column left of 2-run).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors left patterns to right (e.g., row 3: left 8,8,3,3 -> right 3,3,8,8 correctly reversed; row 5-6: 9's and 2's mirrored with length 4 each), adds 8's below 2-blobs in rows 23-26 cols 19-22, and prefixes some 3's before 2's in rows 20-22 cols 14-19.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4, right side has 2,2,2 at cols 19-21 but no 3-prefix before them (expected likely 3's at cols 16-18 or similar based on training patterns); row 7-8 have 1,1 on right but left has 1,1 at cols 5-6, suggesting incomplete mirroring or continuation skip error.
 * Row 20-22: 3's and 2's prefixed correctly on right, but row 22 has 2,3 on left cols 5-6 which seems like a partial fill error (complete_partial_left_two may have over-applied); expected likely no left changes there.
 * 8-block in rows 23-26 cols 19-22 looks correct for below 2's in row 19? But test input not shown, assuming based on patterns—partial 8 at row 23 col 4? Code has no such fill, but earlier partial rule mentions col 3.
 * Missing upward extensions for uniform sequences (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 might need upward if applicable); overall, test output has more fills than expected in left partials and incomplete prefixes, suggesting same prefix bug as training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:34:15] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (with row 13 and column 13 as dividers or barriers) where blank cells (4s) are filled based on pattern completion rules involving symmetry (mirroring left-to-right across the center), sequence extensions (e.g., completing 2s with 3s as prefixes/suffixes), blob extensions (adding 8s to rectangular groups of 2s), and special fillings for even-width rectangular 2-blobs (adding 9s and 1s). The goal is to apply these rules in a specific order to match the expected completed grid without overwriting existing non-4 cells unless specified.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross (row 13 and column 13) that must be skipped or treated as barriers; no filling occurs there, and blobs cannot cross them.
 * Left side (columns 0-12) and right side (14-26) are handled semi-independently but with mirroring: sequences on left can be reversed and placed on right if they start after column 13, but only if not a direct vertical continuation from the row above, and only overwrite if the sequence contains 1,3, or 9.
 * Sequence extraction (get_sequence) finds contiguous non-4 runs starting from a column, but mirroring requires symmetric positioning (e.g., end_left mirrored to start_right = 26 - end_left) and skips if start_right < 14.
 * Completing 2s with 3s: On left, add 3-suffix after a run of 2s if space allows and blanks; on right, add 3-prefix before a run of 2s, but skip rows with any 9 on left. Length of 3-run matches 2-run length (k).
 * Blobs of 2s are only extended if rectangular (h * w == blob size), and 8s are added above (for upper blobs) or below (for lower blobs) in matching widths, but only on blanks; no diagonal or irregular shapes.
 * For even-width rectangular 2-blobs on left (w >=2, even, fully within 0-12), add w/2 9s to the left and w 1s to the right; symmetric on right but mirrored (9s outside right, 1s inside leftward).
 * Order matters: complete rectangular 2-blobs first, then left 3-suffixes, then mirror, then right 3-prefixes, then add 8s—running out of order can cause overwrites or misses.
 * Subtle: "Overwrite" in mirroring only if seq has 1/3/9, but still checks for 4 or overwrite condition; blobs exclude single cells (len(blob)>1); no filling if prefix/suffix would go outside bounds or overlap non-4s.
 * Vertical continuity check (is_continuation) prevents redundant mirroring if the exact sequence repeats from row above at same start column.
 * All operations preserve existing non-4 cells; 4s are blanks to fill.
 * Easy to miss: Rectangular check is strict (no holes or irregular); 8-extensions are vertical only (same columns); mirroring skips short sequences or those too close to center; right-side 3-prefix skips rows with left 9s to avoid conflicts.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) partially understands mirroring and blob extraction but fails on sequence completion and ordering, leading to incorrect 3-placements and missed 8-extensions in both training examples.
 * For Training 1: Generated incorrectly places 9s and 2s in row 6 left (expected 2s further left without 9s there), adds extra 1s in row 5 right where expected 3s, misses 8 in row 3 right col 21-22 (generated 4s), places 3s in row 18-20 left starting too early (expected from col 14), and adds 8 in row 21 left col 3 where expected nothing; also row 6 right has 1,1,2,2,9 but expected 3,3,2,2,4. These differences suggest over-aggressive mirroring without proper continuation checks and wrong 3-prefix logic.
 * For Training 2: Generated places 3s in row 4 left col 6 (unexpected, expected nothing), adds 1s in row 5-6 left cols 7-8 where expected nothing, over-extends 8s in rows 23-26 right (expected 3s mixed in), places 1s in row 20 right where expected nothing, and misses 3s in row 23 right cols 20-21 (generated 8s); row 23 left has 8,8,3,3 but expected nothing there. Issues include faulty rectangular 2-blob detection (wrong widths for 9/1 filling) and 3-prefix overwriting existing patterns.
 * Function `mirror_left_to_right` is partially helpful but broken: it overwrites too eagerly (e.g., places reversed seq even on non-4s if condition met) and skips valid mirrors if start_right <14 incorrectly; needs tighter bounds and continuation logic.
 * Function `complete_right_two_with_three_prefix` is unhelpful/broken: skips rows with left 9s correctly but fills 3s in wrong positions (e.g., too far right or overwriting), and loop starts from c=26 but decrements without proper start detection.
 * Function `complete_left_two_with_three_suffix` has similar issues: fills 3s but increments c incorrectly after fill, leading to missed or extra suffixes.
 * Function `add_eight_blocks` is helpful for blob extension but limited: only vertical, rectangular, and direction based on blob position (upper adds above, lower below), but misses some (e.g., Train1 row3 right) due to prior wrong fillings; doesn't handle mixed upper/lower well.
 * Function `complete_rectangular_two_blobs` is mostly helpful for 9/1 additions but buggy on right side: mirrors incorrectly (adds 9s outward but 1s inward with wrong counts), and assumes even w but doesn't check vertical alignment strictly.
 * Overall, attempt shows core understanding of blobs and mirroring but fails on order (e.g., mirroring before all completions causes chain errors) and boundary conditions (e.g., col 12/14 edges); extract_blobs is essential and correct for identifying groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It overfills with 9s in rows 5-6 left (four 9s wide, but expected fewer or none based on patterns), places 1s in rows 7-8 left cols 5-6 unexpectedly (likely wrong mirroring of 2s), adds 3s in row 4 right cols 14-17 where a prefix for 2s in 19-21 might be intended but positioning seems off (expected possibly shifted), extends 8s in row 2 left cols 3-4 and row 20-23 right cols 18-21 but misses potential upper extensions above row 2; row 20-22 left has 1s and 2s with 9s that look like over-mirrored from right 2s without continuation check. These suggest the program applies rules but in wrong sequence, causing asymmetric fills (e.g., left 9s not mirrored properly to right 1s) and extra blobs; does not match expected symmetry or completion as rules would dictate cleaner 3-prefixes and rectangular 8s without extras.

[2025-10-02 03:34:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 28-row by 27-column grid partially filled with colors (integers 1-9 representing shapes or blobs) and 4's as empty/background spaces, featuring a fixed central column (index 13) and central row (index 13) filled with 1's forming a cross; the goal is to complete the grid by applying a symmetry-based rule across the central vertical axis to form coherent patterns or objects, likely mirroring or propagating colors for individual shapes while preserving some asymmetries or shifts in the final output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid symmetry is left-right around column 13 (pairs like column 0 with 26, 1 with 25, ..., 12 with 14), but the expected outputs are not fully symmetric overall—patterns appear mirrored within specific "objects" or blobs of the same color, but these blobs can be shifted vertically (e.g., by 1 row) between left and right sides, and some areas remain one-sided without a mirror.
 * Empty cells (4's) are filled only where they complete a symmetric object, but not blindly; if both symmetric positions are 4 in the input, the program must infer the color from context (e.g., adjacent rows or connected components), as the current attempt fails to do this and leaves them empty when expected has a color.
 * Conflicts occur when symmetric positions both have non-4 colors: the attempt leaves them unchanged, but expected resolves to a specific pattern (e.g., preferring a connected blob's color or reversing order for mirror effect), suggesting object-based completion rather than global overwrite.
 * Patterns involve connected same-color blobs (e.g., 8's forming a shape across 2-4 rows/columns, 2's and 3's forming reversed-mirror shapes like 2-2-3-3 on left matching 3-3-2-2 on right but shifted down by 1 row); subtle shifts and reversals are key, and blobs do not always straddle the center equally.
 * The central cross of 1's is invariant and not to be modified; colors do not propagate into or across the center unless part of a blob.
 * No horizontal symmetry is evident, but vertical shifts suggest possible interaction with the central row; objects seem "drawn" partially on left or right, requiring completion to a symmetric form without overfilling unrelated areas.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have isolated or partial blobs on one side (e.g., 3's appearing only on right without left mirror in some rows), indicating the rule completes only intended objects, not the entire grid; over-mirroring creates extras not in expected.
 * Input likely has sparse hints (some 4's on both sides of pairs), so the program must detect blobs (connected same-color groups, perhaps 4-connected or 8-connected) and extend them symmetrically if incomplete.
 * Row 13 (all 1's) and column 13 (all 1's) act as barriers or fixed elements; colors do not cross them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `make_grid_copy` using `deepcopy` is helpful for non-destructive processing. The `apply_left_right_symmetry` captures the core idea of pairing positions and filling 4's but is incomplete (see unhelpful below); it could be extended to detect blobs first.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

# Potential helpful extension: Extract connected components (blobs) of same color, ignoring 4's and 1's in center.
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Finds connected components (4-connected) of a given color, excluding center cross.
    Returns list of lists of (row, col) positions for each blob.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and not (j == 13 or i == 13):
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and not (ny == 13 or nx == 13):
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies non-4 colors to symmetric 4 positions in cases where only one side has the color (e.g., in training 1 row 4, 8's are filled on right to match left, appearing in generated as 8's on both sides at positions 5-6 left and 20-21 right, which aligns with expected).
 * It fails to fill positions where both symmetric spots are 4 in input but expected requires a color, indicating no inference of missing blob parts (e.g., in training 1 row 3, generated has all 4's on sides, but expected has 8's at right 20-21; likely input had 4's there, but context from adjacent rows demands filling).
 * In conflict cases (both sides non-4 but different), it preserves the input without resolution, leading to mismatches (e.g., training 1 row 5: generated keeps left 8's at 5-6 and right 2's at 20-21, but expected has left 8's at 5-6 and right 3's at 18-19 + 2's at 20-21, so missed filling 18-19 with 3's and didn't reverse/resolve the 8 vs. 2 conflict).
 * For training 1 row 6-7, generated correctly mirrors the 2's and 3's where possible (left 5-8 = 2,2,3,3 to right 18-21 = 3,3,2,2, matching the reversed pattern in expected), showing partial success for connected blobs without conflict.
 * In training 2 row 4-5, it mirrors 3's and 8's correctly in some pairs (e.g., position 6 left 3 to 20 right 3), but fails lower down (e.g., row 20 generated has symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but expected has extended 9's, 2's, and 1's only on left at 2-11, with partial on right in row 21-22, indicating over-mirroring unrelated areas).
 * Training 1 mismatches include missing one-sided fills (e.g., row 18-19 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 at 16-21 in expected, but generated likely left some as 4 if no left mirror); row 20 left adds 2 at 3 and 3 at 4 in expected without right mirror. Unknown why generated row 5 right has only 2's at 20-21 but misses 3's at 18-19—possibly input had 3's but code didn't propagate due to non-empty adjacent or range limit.
 * Training 2 mismatches: generated row 20-23 overfills symmetric 2's, but expected has asymmetric extension (e.g., row 20 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 but right all 4's; row 21 right partial 1,1,2,2,9); row 23-24 generated symmetric 3's/8's, but expected has them only on right or shifted.
 * The `apply_left_right_symmetry` function is partially helpful for pairing and filling empties but broken for conflicts and inference—it collects non-4's before modifying but doesn't overwrite non-4's or detect blobs for extension, leading to incomplete outputs; do not use as-is in future, but adapt for blob detection.
 * No other functions in the attempt; `deepcopy` is reliable but basic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it attempts full left-right mirroring by filling 4's (e.g., row 3 left 3-6=8,8,3,3 mirrored to right 20-23=3,3,8,8; row 4 adds 2's at right 18-20 and 8's at 21-22), creating a mostly symmetric grid, but expected likely follows the same partial, shifted, object-based completion as training (e.g., blobs like 9's in row 5-6 left 1-4=9's mirrored but reversed/shifted on right, with 2's at 5-7 both sides but not overfilled; 1's in row 7-8 at 5-6 both sides). 
 * It overfills symmetries where expected may leave one-sided (e.g., row 20-23 generated symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but test input patterns suggest asymmetric extensions like training 2 row 20); misses potential inferences for empty pairs (e.g., if input has partial 3's or 8's blobs, generated fills only existing mirrors, but expected would complete shifted blobs).
 * The output makes some sense for simple symmetry (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 at 1-4 left to 22-25 right, 2's connected), but looks too uniform/symmetric compared to training expecteds' partial/shifted blobs, suggesting it doesn't handle vertical shifts or object boundaries correctly—likely incorrect as it would fail similar to training cases with missing fills (e.g., if test has empty symmetric pairs needing context fill, they stay 4).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (indices 0-26), where non-empty cells (values other than 4, which seems to represent blanks or empty space) in certain regions are propagated via reflections across the vertical midline, horizontal midline, and main diagonal to fill in corresponding blank cells in symmetric positions, resulting in a fully symmetric completed grid. The goal is to apply these reflections correctly in the right order or iterations to match the expected symmetric patterns in training examples, which include colored shapes (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, 9s) that mirror across quadrants while preserving a central row of 1s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 27x27, with row 13 (0-indexed) fixed as all 1s, acting as a central divider or axis that should not be altered.
 * Reflections are across three axes: vertical (columns symmetric around c=13), horizontal (rows symmetric around r=13), and diagonal (both r and c symmetric around 13), but the current implementation only partially fills blanks (4s) without ensuring full propagation or handling overlaps/multiple reflections per cell.
 * Only copy non-4 values to 4 positions; do not overwrite existing non-4 values, but the order of reflections matters—e.g., upper-right first may not propagate fully if later reflections depend on prior fills.
 * Subtlety: Reflections seem to be one-way (from source to target if target is 4), but may need to be bidirectional or repeated in loops until no changes occur, as partial fills in one step can enable further propagation.
 * Patterns represent shapes (e.g., blobs of 2s, 3s) that must mirror exactly, including size and position; mismatches occur when shapes are incomplete (e.g., missing extensions like three 2s instead of two, or incorrect positioning across the center).
 * The central row (all 1s) and column interactions: values near the center may need special handling to avoid overwriting the 1s row.
 * Grid has quadrants divided by the center lines; upper-left influences lower-right via diagonal, but current code doesn't fully symmetrize all pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs extend shapes horizontally or vertically across more cells (e.g., three 3s and three 2s in row 19-20 of training 1), suggesting reflections must propagate chains of values, not just single cells.
 * No rotation or other transformations; strictly reflections, and 4s are placeholders to be filled, not propagated themselves.
 * Potential for overfilling: If a cell gets filled multiple times from different reflections, it should stabilize to the correct value, but current code doesn't iterate.

# Note: This flood-fill could help verify symmetry by checking if shapes mirror across axes, but it's not used in the current program.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used three one-way reflection functions (upper-right vertical, bottom-left horizontal, bottom-right diagonal), applied sequentially without iteration, which partially filled some symmetric positions but failed to propagate full shapes (e.g., in training 1, generated two 2s where expected three, and misplaced 8s/3s in lower rows).
 * Worked: Correctly identified the three symmetry axes and conditional filling (only to 4s from non-4s), and preserved the central row of 1s; some upper-left patterns were mirrored to upper-right and bottom-left correctly (e.g., 8s in rows 4-5).
 * Did not work: Incomplete propagation—e.g., in training 1, row 19 expected three 2s and three 3s extending rightward, but generated only two; row 20 had incorrect 2 at col 3 instead of expected 2 at col 3 but missing extensions; diagonal reflection didn't fully mirror shapes across center (e.g., 8s in row 21-22 expected three-wide but generated two).
 * In training 2, generated partial mirrors (e.g., 2s and 9s in rows 5-6 mirrored somewhat, but row 20 had extra 2s where expected 9s/1s chain; row 23 had 3s/8s misplaced); failed to extend shapes like four 2s into proper symmetric blocks with 1s and 9s.
 * Order of reflections caused issues: upper-right first filled verticals prematurely, but horizontal/diagonal didn't update based on those changes, leading to asymmetries (e.g., unknown reason for 1s appearing in wrong positions in row 5 col 20-21 of training 2 generated vs. expected).
 * No iteration: Single pass per reflection means chained fills (e.g., a fill enabling another reflection) are missed.
 * Loops only over range(13) instead of 27, limiting to half-grid and missing bidirectional or full coverage.
 * Function reflect_upper_right is helpful for vertical symmetry but incomplete (one-way, half-range); similar for others—keep but extend to bidirectional and full range.
 * No shape extraction used, which might help debug by verifying mirrored blobs, but not essential yet.
 * Central row handling is correct (not overwritten), but interactions near row/col 13 are subtle and sometimes lead to partial fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially symmetrizes but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete shape extensions similar to training failures—e.g., row 4 has two 8s and two 3s mirrored to row 23, but expected likely needs three-wide for 2s/3s based on training patterns (row 4 generated: 8,8,3,3 but test input suggests larger blobs); row 5 has two 2s where patterns imply more.
 * In rows 5-6, 9s and 2s are mirrored vertically and diagonally, but only two 2s each instead of potentially three or four to match shape completeness seen in expected trainings; 1s in rows 7-8 and 19-20 appear symmetric but isolated, possibly missing connections to central patterns.
 * Lower half (rows 19-24) has partial mirrors (e.g., row 21 two 2s, row 23 two 8s/3s), but asymmetries like row 4's 8s/3s not fully propagating to row 23's expected extended form; overall, it looks like 70% symmetric but misses chain propagations, making it incorrect without expected to confirm, but inconsistent with training expectations for full shape mirroring.
 * The output preserves the central 1s row correctly, which is good, but fails to handle larger blobs (e.g., four 9s in row 6 not fully mirrored horizontally in lower rows).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid divided by central lines at row 13 and column 13, where patterns (sequences or "blobs" of numbers representing colors like 1,2,3,8,9) on the left side (columns 0-12) are mirrored, extended, or transformed to the right side (columns 14-26) and sometimes downward, following rules for symmetry, continuations from above rows, prefixing runs of 2's with 3's, and adding blocks of 8's below certain 2-blobs, while leaving 4's as empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed dividers: all of row 13 and column 13 are filled with 1's, and patterns do not cross these lines (e.g., blobs skip column 13 and row 13 in extraction).
 * Mirroring from left to right applies to sequences of non-4 cells in a row, but only if they are not exact continuations of the same sequence from the row above (to avoid over-mirroring vertical stacks); reversed sequences are placed starting from the symmetric position on the right (e.g., for a sequence ending at column j on left, mirror starts at 26 - (j- something)).
 * For runs of 2's on the right side (columns 14+), if length >=2, prefix them with an equal-length run of 3's immediately to the left (in columns 13+), but only fill 4's without conflicts.
 * Below blobs of 2's (connected components, ignoring dividers), add vertical extensions of 8's in the rows immediately below the blob's bottom row, matching the blob's horizontal width, but only in empty (4) cells; also handle partial fills like a single 8 at specific positions (e.g., column 3 in the first extension row).
 * Complete partial extensions: if a 2 on the left (columns 0-12) is followed by a 4 to its right, fill that 4 with 3 (suggesting a "partial left two" rule for incomplete mirrors).
 * Subtlety: For uniform-color sequences (all same number) of length >=2 (except color 1), if not a continuation, extend upward into the previous row's mirror area if empty.
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same color, excluding divider cells; only blobs with size >1 are considered for extensions.
 * Conflicts in mirroring: if a mirror position already has a non-4 that doesn't match the expected reversed value, skip filling; partial matches (some cells already correct) may still allow filling the rest.
 * Order of operations matters: mirroring first, then completing 2-runs with 3-prefixes, then adding 8-blocks below 2-blobs, then partial left completions.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side patterns can influence left-side fills (e.g., 3-prefixes extend leftward into column 14- but wait, code has i=14, filling left to c=i-1-p >=14? Wait, seems buggy); also, 9's and other colors like 1's may have special non-mirroring behavior.
 * Vertical influences: Check for continuations only upward (r-1), not downward; 8-extensions are strictly below and don't mirror.
 * Grid is 27 rows x 27 cols, but patterns are sparse; row 13 is all 1's, column 13 all 1's in output.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented mirroring of left sequences to right (reversed), but skipped fills too aggressively on continuations and conflicts, leading to incomplete right-side patterns in both training examples.
 * Worked: Basic mirroring for non-continuation sequences (e.g., in training 1, correctly placed some 8's below and 2's/3's on right); extracted 2-blobs correctly for 8-extensions in some positions (e.g., rows 20-22 in training 1 match expected 8's).
 * Didn't work: In training 1, row 5 (0-indexed) generated [3,3,2,2] starting at col 19 but expected starts at col 18 with [3,3,2,2]; also added extra 2 at row 20 col 23 which expected lacks; row 6 has correct but overall mismatches in 3-prefix positioning.
 * In training 1, failed to prefix 2-runs with 3's correctly in rows 18-19 (generated correct, but row 20 has misplaced 2/3); also added 8 at row 3 col 20-21 which expected has, but extra 8's elsewhere.
 * In training 2, mirroring introduced incorrect 3's and 8's in left side (e.g., row 3 col 6=3 but expected 4? Wait, expected has 3 at row 3 col 20); over-extended 8-blocks to width 4 in rows 23-26 but expected varies (e.g., row 23 has 8's at col 19-22, but generated has at 19-22 correctly? Wait, mismatches in row 20-22 with extra 2's and 3's on left).
 * In training 2, complete_two_runs_with_three_prefix filled 3's leftward from right 2's but started at i=14 and filled to c>=14, which is buggy (should fill into left? But code fills left from i, yet i=14 is right side); led to no fills in some prefix spots.
 * add_eight_block_below_two_blob worked partially (added 8's below 2-blobs in right side), but over-added vertically (e.g., in training 2, extended to row 26 but expected stops earlier) and added partial 8 at col 3 incorrectly or missed.
 * complete_partial_left_two only checked cols 0-12 for 2 followed by 4, filling with 3, but missed cases where partials are deeper or on right.
 * extract_blobs is helpful and correct for finding connected 2-groups, but only used for color=2; could extend to other colors.
 * mirror_left_to_right has logic for uniform color upward extension, but condition "all(x == sequence[0] for x in sequence) and sequence[0] != 1" skipped color=1 correctly but over-applied for 2's in some vertical stacks.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of mirroring and blob extensions but bugs in prefixing (wrong starting columns, conflicts), over-filling 8's, and missing subtle position shifts (e.g., 3-prefixes start one column left of 2-run).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors left patterns to right (e.g., row 3: left 8,8,3,3 -> right 3,3,8,8 correctly reversed; row 5-6: 9's and 2's mirrored with length 4 each), adds 8's below 2-blobs in rows 23-26 cols 19-22, and prefixes some 3's before 2's in rows 20-22 cols 14-19.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4, right side has 2,2,2 at cols 19-21 but no 3-prefix before them (expected likely 3's at cols 16-18 or similar based on training patterns); row 7-8 have 1,1 on right but left has 1,1 at cols 5-6, suggesting incomplete mirroring or continuation skip error.
 * Row 20-22: 3's and 2's prefixed correctly on right, but row 22 has 2,3 on left cols 5-6 which seems like a partial fill error (complete_partial_left_two may have over-applied); expected likely no left changes there.
 * 8-block in rows 23-26 cols 19-22 looks correct for below 2's in row 19? But test input not shown, assuming based on patterns—partial 8 at row 23 col 4? Code has no such fill, but earlier partial rule mentions col 3.
 * Missing upward extensions for uniform sequences (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 might need upward if applicable); overall, test output has more fills than expected in left partials and incomplete prefixes, suggesting same prefix bug as training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (with row 13 and column 13 as dividers or barriers) where blank cells (4s) are filled based on pattern completion rules involving symmetry (mirroring left-to-right across the center), sequence extensions (e.g., completing 2s with 3s as prefixes/suffixes), blob extensions (adding 8s to rectangular groups of 2s), and special fillings for even-width rectangular 2-blobs (adding 9s and 1s). The goal is to apply these rules in a specific order to match the expected completed grid without overwriting existing non-4 cells unless specified.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross (row 13 and column 13) that must be skipped or treated as barriers; no filling occurs there, and blobs cannot cross them.
 * Left side (columns 0-12) and right side (14-26) are handled semi-independently but with mirroring: sequences on left can be reversed and placed on right if they start after column 13, but only if not a direct vertical continuation from the row above, and only overwrite if the sequence contains 1,3, or 9.
 * Sequence extraction (get_sequence) finds contiguous non-4 runs starting from a column, but mirroring requires symmetric positioning (e.g., end_left mirrored to start_right = 26 - end_left) and skips if start_right < 14.
 * Completing 2s with 3s: On left, add 3-suffix after a run of 2s if space allows and blanks; on right, add 3-prefix before a run of 2s, but skip rows with any 9 on left. Length of 3-run matches 2-run length (k).
 * Blobs of 2s are only extended if rectangular (h * w == blob size), and 8s are added above (for upper blobs) or below (for lower blobs) in matching widths, but only on blanks; no diagonal or irregular shapes.
 * For even-width rectangular 2-blobs on left (w >=2, even, fully within 0-12), add w/2 9s to the left and w 1s to the right; symmetric on right but mirrored (9s outside right, 1s inside leftward).
 * Order matters: complete rectangular 2-blobs first, then left 3-suffixes, then mirror, then right 3-prefixes, then add 8s—running out of order can cause overwrites or misses.
 * Subtle: "Overwrite" in mirroring only if seq has 1/3/9, but still checks for 4 or overwrite condition; blobs exclude single cells (len(blob)>1); no filling if prefix/suffix would go outside bounds or overlap non-4s.
 * Vertical continuity check (is_continuation) prevents redundant mirroring if the exact sequence repeats from row above at same start column.
 * All operations preserve existing non-4 cells; 4s are blanks to fill.
 * Easy to miss: Rectangular check is strict (no holes or irregular); 8-extensions are vertical only (same columns); mirroring skips short sequences or those too close to center; right-side 3-prefix skips rows with left 9s to avoid conflicts.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) partially understands mirroring and blob extraction but fails on sequence completion and ordering, leading to incorrect 3-placements and missed 8-extensions in both training examples.
 * For Training 1: Generated incorrectly places 9s and 2s in row 6 left (expected 2s further left without 9s there), adds extra 1s in row 5 right where expected 3s, misses 8 in row 3 right col 21-22 (generated 4s), places 3s in row 18-20 left starting too early (expected from col 14), and adds 8 in row 21 left col 3 where expected nothing; also row 6 right has 1,1,2,2,9 but expected 3,3,2,2,4. These differences suggest over-aggressive mirroring without proper continuation checks and wrong 3-prefix logic.
 * For Training 2: Generated places 3s in row 4 left col 6 (unexpected, expected nothing), adds 1s in row 5-6 left cols 7-8 where expected nothing, over-extends 8s in rows 23-26 right (expected 3s mixed in), places 1s in row 20 right where expected nothing, and misses 3s in row 23 right cols 20-21 (generated 8s); row 23 left has 8,8,3,3 but expected nothing there. Issues include faulty rectangular 2-blob detection (wrong widths for 9/1 filling) and 3-prefix overwriting existing patterns.
 * Function `mirror_left_to_right` is partially helpful but broken: it overwrites too eagerly (e.g., places reversed seq even on non-4s if condition met) and skips valid mirrors if start_right <14 incorrectly; needs tighter bounds and continuation logic.
 * Function `complete_right_two_with_three_prefix` is unhelpful/broken: skips rows with left 9s correctly but fills 3s in wrong positions (e.g., too far right or overwriting), and loop starts from c=26 but decrements without proper start detection.
 * Function `complete_left_two_with_three_suffix` has similar issues: fills 3s but increments c incorrectly after fill, leading to missed or extra suffixes.
 * Function `add_eight_blocks` is helpful for blob extension but limited: only vertical, rectangular, and direction based on blob position (upper adds above, lower below), but misses some (e.g., Train1 row3 right) due to prior wrong fillings; doesn't handle mixed upper/lower well.
 * Function `complete_rectangular_two_blobs` is mostly helpful for 9/1 additions but buggy on right side: mirrors incorrectly (adds 9s outward but 1s inward with wrong counts), and assumes even w but doesn't check vertical alignment strictly.
 * Overall, attempt shows core understanding of blobs and mirroring but fails on order (e.g., mirroring before all completions causes chain errors) and boundary conditions (e.g., col 12/14 edges); extract_blobs is essential and correct for identifying groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It overfills with 9s in rows 5-6 left (four 9s wide, but expected fewer or none based on patterns), places 1s in rows 7-8 left cols 5-6 unexpectedly (likely wrong mirroring of 2s), adds 3s in row 4 right cols 14-17 where a prefix for 2s in 19-21 might be intended but positioning seems off (expected possibly shifted), extends 8s in row 2 left cols 3-4 and row 20-23 right cols 18-21 but misses potential upper extensions above row 2; row 20-22 left has 1s and 2s with 9s that look like over-mirrored from right 2s without continuation check. These suggest the program applies rules but in wrong sequence, causing asymmetric fills (e.g., left 9s not mirrored properly to right 1s) and extra blobs; does not match expected symmetry or completion as rules would dictate cleaner 3-prefixes and rectangular 8s without extras.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:45:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 matrix (with row 13 and column 13 acting as a central divider or cross that is skipped in most operations), where blank cells (4's) are filled based on symmetry, pattern extension, and propagation rules involving specific numbers (e.g., runs of 2's extend to 3's, uniform 2 blocks pair with 9's and 1's, 2 blobs extend to 8's vertically). The goal is to apply a sequence of transformations to complete the grid logically, matching expected patterns in training examples, likely simulating a logic puzzle like a fill-a-pix or region-growing challenge with mirroring across the center.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross (row 13 and column 13) that must be skipped in all operations—no filling or propagation into/out of these positions, and blobs or runs cannot cross them.
 * Mirroring is left-to-right (or symmetric across column 13), but only applies to non-continuation sequences of length >=2 on the left side (columns 0-12), filling 4's on the right (columns 14-26) with reversed sequences if at least one matching non-4 exists on the right to "seed" it; continuations (identical left runs in consecutive rows) are skipped to avoid over-mirroring vertical patterns.
 * Runs of 2's on the left (columns 0-12) can extend rightward into adjacent 4's with 3's (suffix after the run), but only if the extension fits within columns 0-12 without overlapping non-4's.
 * On the right (columns 14-26), runs of 2's can extend leftward (prefix) into 4's with 3's, but only if the prefix fits and is all 4's.
 * Uniform even-length (>=2) runs of 2's on the left extend leftward into 4's with 9's (half the length) and rightward into 4's with 1's (half the length), but only if spaces are all 4's and within bounds (0-12); similar but mirrored logic for right-side 2 runs (1's prefix, 9's suffix), though the suffix logic in the code has bounds issues (e.g., min(nines_start + num9, 27) risks overflow).
 * Vertical propagation fills 4's above (upward) or below (downward) based on non-4 neighbors, but skips the center row/column and only propagates if the source is non-4.
 * Blobs of 2's are extracted as connected components (4-directional adjacency), excluding singles unless it's a single 2; only rectangular blobs (full height x width fill) are extended vertically with 8's—upward for upper-half blobs (min_r <13), downward for lower-half (max_r >13), but only if the extension space (another full rectangle of same size) is all 4's or existing 8's; average column position determines left/right but isn't used in extension.
 * Subtleties: Order of operations matters (e.g., mirroring before completions, propagation after); avoid filling if it would overlap non-4's or cross center; include single 2's as blobs for potential extension but not others; right-side completions have buggy index calculations (e.g., ones_start = run_start - k assumes prefix length k, but code sets to 1's incorrectly in some cases); vertical extension skips if partial (e.g., ext_end_r >26); propagation is bidirectional but applied in passes (up then down).
 * General: All changes must be conservative—only fill 4's, never overwrite non-4's; patterns suggest thematic consistency (e.g., 2's as "cores" extending to borders like 3/8/9/1); test for rectangularity strictly (len(positions) == height * width).

def get_left_run(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:
    seq = []
    c = 0
    while c < 13 and grid[r][c] != 4:
        seq.append(grid[r][c])
        c += 1
    return c - len(seq), seq  # Returns start column and sequence
```
(Helpful for identifying left-side runs for mirroring/continuations; core to symmetry detection, but assumes runs start at c=0—may need generalization for mid-row runs.)

```python
def is_continuation(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> bool:
    if r == 0:
        return False
    prev_start, prev_seq = get_left_run(grid, r - 1)
    curr_start, curr_seq = get_left_run(grid, r)
    return prev_start == curr_start and prev_seq == curr_seq
```
(Useful for skipping vertical repeats in mirroring; prevents over-filling stacked patterns.)

```python
def propagate_vertical(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = make_grid_copy(grid)
    # Up propagation (fill above from below)
    for r in range(1, 27):
        for c in range(27):
            if r == 13 or c == 13:
                continue
            if g[r - 1][c] == 4 and g[r][c] != 4:
                g[r - 1][c] = g[r][c]
    # Down propagation (fill below from above)
    for r in range(26):
        for c in range(27):
            if r == 13 or c == 13:
                continue
            if g[r][c] != 4 and g[r + 1][c] == 4:
                g[r + 1][c] = g[r][c]
    return g
```
(Helpful for vertical filling; bidirectional and skips center correctly, but may need multiple iterations if chains are long; works well for simple cases but could propagate too early if order is wrong.)

```python
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    rows, cols = 27, 27
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and i != 13 and j != 13:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and nx != 13 and ny != 13:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(blob) > 1 or (len(blob) == 1 and color == 2):  # include singles for 2
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```
(Essential for identifying connected 2's as blobs; DFS-based, excludes center, includes single 2's—key for extension rules; could be extended for other colors.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `mirror_left_to_right`: Buggy—has_match check requires a matching non-4 on right, but fills only 4's with reversed seq; skips too aggressively and doesn't handle mid-row starts; leads to under-filling (e.g., no mirroring in train1 row5-12).
- `complete_2_runs_with_3`: Left-side suffix logic overlaps run (c += k -1 buggy); right-side prefix assumes prefix_start = run_start - k, which may not match run length; overfills or skips valid extensions.
- `complete_uniform_2_with_9_1_left`: Assumes even k for uniform 2's, extends prefix with 9's (k//2) and suffix with 1's (k), but suffix end = s_start + k risks exceeding 13; only left-side, ignores non-uniform.
- `complete_2_run_right_with_1_9`: Similar bugs—ones_start = run_start - k (should be half?), nines_start = run_start + k, and bounds check is incomplete (min(...,27) but 27 is out); fills 1's in prefix but code sets to 1's incorrectly for length k instead of half.
- `extend_2_with_8`: Only extends if fully rectangular and space is 4's/8's, but upper extension checks g[er][ec] !=4 and !=8 (should be ==4 or ==8?); lower extension sets to 8 unconditionally if can_extend; avg_c <13.5 unused; doesn't handle partial or non-rect blobs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding of rules but poor implementation.
 * Worked: Vertical propagation correctly fills some chains (e.g., 1's in column 13? Wait, column 13 skipped, but row13 is all 1's untouched); blob extraction identifies 2's for extension; some 3's from 2-runs are placed (e.g., train1 rows 5-12 columns 7-8).
 * Didn't work: Mirroring underperforms—no fills in many expected symmetric spots (e.g., train1 row6 columns 18-19 should be 3,3 but empty); 8's misplaced or missing (train1 generated has 8's in row3 col5-6 and row4 col5-6, but expected has them in row4 col21-22, row5 col21-22, row21 col3, row22 col20-22); extra/unexpected 9's and 1's (train1 row5 col18-19=1,1 but expected empty until later); 3's overextended (train1 row17 col16-18=3,3,3 but expected starts later); right-side 2-run completions buggy, leading to no 9's in train1 row5 col22.
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated fills 8's too early/left (rows3-4 col5-6) vs expected right/lower (rows4-5 col21-22, row21 col3, rows22-24 col20-22); misses 2's in row6 col5-6 and 3's in row6 col7-8; extra 1's in row4 col18-19; lower half 3's/2's shifted wrong (row20 col3=2 but expected row20 empty there).
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in row2 col6 and row4 col6 (expected empty); 8's in row4 col5-6 but expected row4 col5 empty, row5 col21=3,8; fills 1's in row5 col7-8 but expected there; lower half overfills 9's/2's/1's in rows19-26 col2-13 (e.g., row19 col2-3=9,9 but expected row19 empty col2-3); misses 8's in row23 col4-5 and 3's in row24-25 col6-7.
 * Function `complete_2_run_right_with_1_9` is broken (index errors, wrong lengths—e.g., fills full k 1's instead of half); `extend_2_with_8` is partially helpful but buggy (wrong can_extend logic, unused is_left); overall program order (mirror -> left9/1 -> right1/9 -> 3's -> prop -> extend) causes early fills to block later ones.
 * extract_blobs is essential for 2-extension but underused (only for 8's, misses non-rect or multi-color blobs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it overfills the grid with patterns that don't align with training expectations, suggesting rule misapplications (e.g., heavy 9's in rows5-12 col1-4 look like overextended left 2-runs, but training shows more sparse 9's; 8's in rows2-3 col3-4 and row4 col3-4 seem prematurely extended upward without full rectangles; lower half has 1's in row18 col14-17 and 2's/9's in rows19-26 col20-27, but training lower patterns are more contained like row20 col3=2,3 without broad 1's prefix). It appears to propagate too aggressively (e.g., 3's in rows3-12 col16-18 match train but extend to row2 incorrectly); misses potential mirroring (e.g., if input has left 3's, right should symmetric but seems asymmetric). Without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify fully, but it doesn't make sense as a logical completion—too many dense fills (e.g., rows5-12 almost full col0-9 with 9/2/1) vs training's sparser, symmetric results; likely needs better bounds checking and continuation skips to handle test's unique patterns (e.g., longer vertical 2's?).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 03:45:58] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 03:49:44] Response:
- **Vertical reflection transformation for top quadrants (consistent across both train examples)**: The position (bbox x-coordinates) and color of non-background blocks (e.g., Maroon, Green, Red, Light Blue, Blue) in the top-left quadrant interact to produce corresponding blocks in the top-right quadrant. Specifically, x-coordinates are reflected over the vertical center (approximately x' = 26 - x, reversing the x-interval: new_xmin = 26 - old_xmax, new_xmax = 26 - old_xmin), y-coordinates remain unchanged, color is preserved, holes remain 0, and pixels/bbox dimensions are approximately preserved. If the reflected position would overlap or closely adjoin an existing block in the top-right, the y-position is adjusted (e.g., shifted up by 1 unit) to attach adjacently without overlap, preserving the relative structure (e.g., L-shape orientation flips left-right due to reflection).

- **Horizontal reflection transformation for bottom quadrants (consistent across both train examples)**: The position (bbox y-coordinates) and color of blocks in the top half (after vertical symmetry is applied) interact to produce corresponding blocks in the bottom half of the same side (left or right quadrant). Specifically, y-coordinates are reflected over the horizontal center (y' = 26 - y, reversing the y-interval: new_ymin = 26 - old_ymax, new_ymax = 26 - old_ymin), x-coordinates remain unchanged (no left-right flip for vertical reflection), color is preserved, holes remain 0, and pixels/bbox dimensions are approximately preserved. If the reflected position would overlap or closely adjoin an existing block in the bottom quadrant, the position is adjusted (e.g., shifted in x or y by 1 unit, or extended in bbox dimensions) and/or resized to attach adjacently or merge ranges (e.g., matching y-range or x-adjacency to existing Red blocks), while preserving the relative structure (e.g., horizontal extensions attach inner/outer based on top pattern).

- **Dependency on existing blocks during reflection adjustments (consistent across both train examples)**: Position and size (bbox, pixels) of existing Red blocks in target quadrants (top-right or bottom) effect the final placement and sizing of reflected blocks. Adjustments prioritize attachment (adjacent positioning) over exact reflection, often extending or shifting to align with the existing block's bbox (e.g., matching height/width, inner-side adjacency for horizontal parts), without changing color of the existing block. This interaction prevents overlaps and ensures structural consistency (e.g., completing L-shapes or lines).

- **Preservation of static elements (consistent across both train examples)**: The Blue cross (bbox [0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) has no interaction with other elements and remains unchanged. Yellow quadrant backgrounds (holes typically 1) have minor pixel count variations but no direct transformation from block interactions; changes (e.g., holes=0 in one case) are unknown and not consistently tied to specific block properties.

- **Unknown interactions**: Specific triggers for color choices in bottom additions beyond preservation (e.g., why Green/Maroon in train1 L-completions vs. Light Blue/Blue in train2 extensions) are not consistently explained by position, size, or holes across examples—appears dependent on top pattern but not uniformly applied. No consistent interaction observed for isolated small Red blocks without top-pattern analogs (e.g., exact small L-formation in train1 bottom-left). Hole counts (always 0 for blocks) do not effect transformations consistently. Silhouettes/edges do not show consistent movement effects beyond bbox adjustments.

[2025-10-02 03:49:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Vertical reflection transformation for top quadrants (consistent across both train examples)**: The position (bbox x-coordinates) and color of non-background blocks (e.g., Maroon, Green, Red, Light Blue, Blue) in the top-left quadrant interact to produce corresponding blocks in the top-right quadrant. Specifically, x-coordinates are reflected over the vertical center (approximately x' = 26 - x, reversing the x-interval: new_xmin = 26 - old_xmax, new_xmax = 26 - old_xmin), y-coordinates remain unchanged, color is preserved, holes remain 0, and pixels/bbox dimensions are approximately preserved. If the reflected position would overlap or closely adjoin an existing block in the top-right, the y-position is adjusted (e.g., shifted up by 1 unit) to attach adjacently without overlap, preserving the relative structure (e.g., L-shape orientation flips left-right due to reflection).

- **Horizontal reflection transformation for bottom quadrants (consistent across both train examples)**: The position (bbox y-coordinates) and color of blocks in the top half (after vertical symmetry is applied) interact to produce corresponding blocks in the bottom half of the same side (left or right quadrant). Specifically, y-coordinates are reflected over the horizontal center (y' = 26 - y, reversing the y-interval: new_ymin = 26 - old_ymax, new_ymax = 26 - old_ymin), x-coordinates remain unchanged (no left-right flip for vertical reflection), color is preserved, holes remain 0, and pixels/bbox dimensions are approximately preserved. If the reflected position would overlap or closely adjoin an existing block in the bottom quadrant, the position is adjusted (e.g., shifted in x or y by 1 unit, or extended in bbox dimensions) and/or resized to attach adjacently or merge ranges (e.g., matching y-range or x-adjacency to existing Red blocks), while preserving the relative structure (e.g., horizontal extensions attach inner/outer based on top pattern).

- **Dependency on existing blocks during reflection adjustments (consistent across both train examples)**: Position and size (bbox, pixels) of existing Red blocks in target quadrants (top-right or bottom) effect the final placement and sizing of reflected blocks. Adjustments prioritize attachment (adjacent positioning) over exact reflection, often extending or shifting to align with the existing block's bbox (e.g., matching height/width, inner-side adjacency for horizontal parts), without changing color of the existing block. This interaction prevents overlaps and ensures structural consistency (e.g., completing L-shapes or lines).

- **Preservation of static elements (consistent across both train examples)**: The Blue cross (bbox [0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) has no interaction with other elements and remains unchanged. Yellow quadrant backgrounds (holes typically 1) have minor pixel count variations but no direct transformation from block interactions; changes (e.g., holes=0 in one case) are unknown and not consistently tied to specific block properties.

- **Unknown interactions**: Specific triggers for color choices in bottom additions beyond preservation (e.g., why Green/Maroon in train1 L-completions vs. Light Blue/Blue in train2 extensions) are not consistently explained by position, size, or holes across examples—appears dependent on top pattern but not uniformly applied. No consistent interaction observed for isolated small Red blocks without top-pattern analogs (e.g., exact small L-formation in train1 bottom-left). Hole counts (always 0 for blocks) do not effect transformations consistently. Silhouettes/edges do not show consistent movement effects beyond bbox adjustments.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:04:09] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual symmetry puzzle on a 27x27 grid divided into four quadrants (top-left 0-12 rows/cols, top-right 0-12 rows/13-26 cols, bottom-left 13-26 rows/0-12 cols, bottom-right 13-26 rows/13-26 cols), where the goal is to mirror shapes from the top-left quadrant into the other three quadrants using reflections across axes, with special handling for a "red" anchor shape (color 2) that may resize or position blocks relative to it, and flips for x/y axes depending on the target quadrant. The grid uses 4 as background, 1 as a central horizontal divider (row 13), and other colors (e.g., 2,3,8,9) for distinct shapes or blocks that must be copied, flipped, and potentially adjusted for attachments or overlaps without corrupting the background or divider.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Reflections must preserve shape integrity but apply flips: top-right flips horizontally (x-axis mirror), bottom-left and bottom-right flip vertically (y-axis mirror) and possibly adjust for "bottom" orientation, which may invert attachments (e.g., above becomes below).
 * Color 2 (red) is special: it acts as an anchor; if absent in target, copy and flip it from source; if present, use its bounding box to position/resize other blocks relative to attachments (left/right for horizontal, above/below for vertical), adjusting heights/widths based on original red size (e.g., h_new = max(1, h_t - h + orig_red_h) to fit around it).
 * Attachments are crucial: detect if source block touches red on left/right/above/below; if attached, place target block accordingly (e.g., left_attach places to the left of target red, flipping position for bottom quadrants); if not attached, default to full-grid flip (using 26 - coord for mirroring across center).
 * Avoid overlaps: the has_overlap function checks for non-background/non-divider/non-color cells in target area, but it's underused; filling must not overwrite 1 or 4, and shapes shouldn't bleed across quadrants or the divider.
 * Bounding boxes (bbox) must be precise: min/max r/c for each color block in source/target; empty bbox means skip or handle specially (e.g., no red in target triggers full copy/flip).
 * Subtle grid bounds: reflections use 0-12 source, but targets adjust (e.g., top-right cols 14-26); flips use 26 - max/min for centering; bottom quadrants treat row 13 as divider, so vertical placements may shift down (e.g., above_attach in bottom flips to below red).
 * Shapes are solid blocks (rectangular fills), not pixel-perfect; multiple same-color blocks aren't split—treat per color bbox.
 * Easy to miss: when red exists in target, non-attached blocks still flip relative to whole grid, not red; for bottom, horizontal attachments don't flip x, but vertical do y-invert; resize only for attached blocks to "fill gaps" around red; ignore 1 and 4 in color extraction.
 * Order matters: apply reflections sequentially (top-right first, then bottom-left, then bottom-right), as each modifies the grid cumulatively.
 * Potential bugs: fill function clamps to grid (0 to len-1), but may clip shapes; get_colors excludes 1/4 correctly, but doesn't handle multi-block same color; attachment detection uses overlap checks (y_overlap = max(minr, minr_s) <= min(maxr, maxr_s)), but fails if blocks touch edges without overlap.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_colors(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> set:
    colors = set()
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] not in (1, 4):
                colors.add(g[r][c])
    return colors
```
(Extracts unique non-background/divider colors in a region; helpful for identifying shapes to reflect.)

```python
def get_bbox(g: List[List[int]], color: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1) for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1) if g[r][c] == color]
    if not positions:
        return None
    minr = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    maxr = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    minc = min(c for _, c in positions)
    maxc = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return minr, maxr, minc, maxc
```
(Computes tight bounding box for a color in a region; essential for positioning/reflecting individual shapes accurately.)

```python
def fill(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, color: int):
    for r in range(max(0, min_r), min(len(g) - 1, max_r) + 1):
        for c in range(max(0, min_c), min(len(g[0]) - 1, max_c) + 1):
            g[r][c] = color
```
(Fills a rectangular area with a color, clamping to grid bounds; useful for placing reflected shapes, but ensure no overwrite of 1/4.)

```python
def has_overlap(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, color: int) -> bool:
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= r < len(g) and 0 <= c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] not in (1, 4) and g[r][c] != color:
                return True
    return False
```
(Checks if target area has conflicting colors before filling; helpful for avoiding corruption, but underutilized in the main logic—could prevent bad placements.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding of quadrant reflections and flips (e.g., top-right horizontal flip works somewhat, as upper 8s and 2/3 placements are close in training 1), but fails on attachment/resizing logic for red (2), leading to mispositioned or oversized blocks in bottom quadrants.
 * In training 1: Generated places 8s correctly in top-right (rows 4-5, cols 20-21 matching expected), but upper 2/3 in rows 6-7 are correct; however, bottom-left has extra/wrong 8s in rows 15-17 cols 19-22 (expected empty there, has 8s instead of 4s), and row 20 has 2/3 extended to col 23-25 incorrectly (expected only to col 22); row 18-20 2/3 are shifted right vs. expected left-aligned under divider; upper row 3 has 8s in cols 20-21 but expected in row 4 only—timing of reflections overwrites partially.
 * In training 1: Bottom-right row 22 has single 8 in col 3 (generated) vs. expected none; row 20-21 2/3 in cols 19-25 generated vs. expected cols 18-22; unknown reason for 3s in row 21 col 22-25 (mismatch in flip/resize).
 * In training 2: Upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8/3 in rows 4-5 correct, 2/1/9 in rows 5-6 flipped horizontally ok), but bottom-left row 19 has 9/2 misplaced (generated cols 18-21 vs. expected none, expected shapes higher); row 20-21 9/2/1 in cols 16-23 generated vs. expected cols 20-26 flipped; bottom-right row 23-26 3s extended wrongly (generated full row 22-26 cols 4-11 vs. expected partial and positioned differently).
 * In training 2: Row 16-18 bottom-left empty in generated but expected 8/3 placements; attachment detection fails, placing non-attached blocks as attached (e.g., 9s treated as left-attached to non-existent red).
 * Sequential reflection order causes cumulative errors: top-right ok, but bottom-left overwrites with wrong y-flips, bottom-right inherits errors.
 * reflect_quadrant function is overly complex and buggy (e.g., red handling assumes orig_red_h/w from source even if no source red; attachment logic inverts wrongly for bottom (e.g., above_attach sets minr_new = maxr_t +1 but doesn't adjust h_new consistently); skips red copy if has_red_target but doesn't verify).
 * get_colors and get_bbox are helpful and mostly correct (accurate for single-block colors), but fill ignores overlap checks, leading to background corruption (e.g., overwriting 4s with shapes in wrong spots).
 * has_overlap is defined but not called in reflect_quadrant, so useless in practice—add it before fill to skip or adjust placements.
 * No handling for multi-component same-color shapes (bbox takes whole, but if disconnected, it merges wrongly—though examples seem connected).
 * Program assumes fixed quadrants (0-12/14-26), correct for 27x27 with 1-col/row divider at 13, but doesn't protect row 13 from fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it partially mirrors top-left shapes (e.g., 8/3 in rows 3-4 cols 3-7 flipped to top-right cols 20-24 ok, 9/2 in rows 5-6 cols 1-6 to bottom-right cols 18-23), but bottom-left has 3s in rows 15-18 cols 18-20 (unexpected, as source has no direct vertical mirror there—likely false attachment placing 3s relative to phantom red); row 7-8 has 1s in cols 5-6 (corrupting background, expected 4s); bottom-right row 19-22 has oversized 9/2/8 blocks (e.g., row 19 cols 12-19 9s extended beyond expected flip of source 9/2, and 8s in cols 22-26 too wide vs. source 8s); row 20 has 2 in col 5 (stray, not in expected symmetry); upper row 3 8s in cols 20-21 ok but row 4 8s overlap wrongly with 9/2; overall, lacks proper red anchoring (no color 2 in source visible, but generated places 2s in bottom without source, and resizes fail leading to protrusions into divider/background). This suggests the reflection logic over-applies flips without checking source red presence, and attachment detection misfires for vertical bottom placements.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 04:05:22] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 04:06:25] Response:
- **Blue cross and yellow backgrounds**: The blue cross (bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) is fixed and present in every panel across all examples, dividing the canvas into four quadrants with fixed yellow background regions (bboxes: [0,0,12,12], [14,0,26,12], [0,14,12,26], [14,14,26,26]). The cross creates a structural division that confines all other colored blocks to specific quadrants without overlap into the cross area.

- **Colored blocks and yellow backgrounds (pixel coverage interaction)**: In every panel, the pixel count of each yellow background is consistently 169 minus the total pixels of all colored blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue) whose bboxes fall entirely within that quadrant's bbox. This indicates blocks directly cover and reduce the visible pixels of the underlying yellow background in their quadrant, with no overlap between blocks themselves (as totals always sum to 169). This relation holds exactly for all quadrants in both train inputs and outputs.

- **Colored blocks' positional confinement**: All colored blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue; holes=0) have bboxes strictly within one of the four yellow quadrant bboxes in every panel, with no blocks spanning quadrants or the blue cross area. Their positions (bbox coordinates) determine which yellow's pixel count they affect.

- **Yellow backgrounds' hole property**: Yellow backgrounds have holes=1 in nearly all cases across panels (exception: bottom-left in train output 2 has holes=0), potentially linked to the blue cross division, but the exact cause of variation is unknown and not consistently tied to block presence or positions.

- **Red block in top-right quadrant**: A Red block with bbox approximately near [20,5,21,6] and pixels around 4-9 is consistently present in the top-right quadrant across all train inputs and outputs (exact bbox/pixels vary slightly), positioned to affect the top-right yellow's pixel count, but no consistent transformation or interaction with other elements beyond coverage is identifiable.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 04:06:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Blue cross and yellow backgrounds**: The blue cross (bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) is fixed and present in every panel across all examples, dividing the canvas into four quadrants with fixed yellow background regions (bboxes: [0,0,12,12], [14,0,26,12], [0,14,12,26], [14,14,26,26]). The cross creates a structural division that confines all other colored blocks to specific quadrants without overlap into the cross area.

- **Colored blocks and yellow backgrounds (pixel coverage interaction)**: In every panel, the pixel count of each yellow background is consistently 169 minus the total pixels of all colored blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue) whose bboxes fall entirely within that quadrant's bbox. This indicates blocks directly cover and reduce the visible pixels of the underlying yellow background in their quadrant, with no overlap between blocks themselves (as totals always sum to 169). This relation holds exactly for all quadrants in both train inputs and outputs.

- **Colored blocks' positional confinement**: All colored blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Blue, Light Blue; holes=0) have bboxes strictly within one of the four yellow quadrant bboxes in every panel, with no blocks spanning quadrants or the blue cross area. Their positions (bbox coordinates) determine which yellow's pixel count they affect.

- **Yellow backgrounds' hole property**: Yellow backgrounds have holes=1 in nearly all cases across panels (exception: bottom-left in train output 2 has holes=0), potentially linked to the blue cross division, but the exact cause of variation is unknown and not consistently tied to block presence or positions.

- **Red block in top-right quadrant**: A Red block with bbox approximately near [20,5,21,6] and pixels around 4-9 is consistently present in the top-right quadrant across all train inputs and outputs (exact bbox/pixels vary slightly), positioned to affect the top-right yellow's pixel count, but no consistent transformation or interaction with other elements beyond coverage is identifiable.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:18:00] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual symmetry puzzle on a 27x27 grid (divided into four 13x13 quadrants separated by a central row of 1's at row 13 and a central column of 1's implied at col 13, though the middle row spans all columns), where the top-left quadrant provides a base pattern of numbers (1-9 representing colors/objects, 4 as empty), and the goal is to mirror it into the other three quadrants using horizontal, vertical, and 180-degree flips, while resolving overlaps by prioritizing non-4 values only if they match or the target is empty, and potentially applying vertical shifts in the top-right to align without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid structure is fixed: rows 0-12 and cols 0-12 are given (top-left); row 13 is all 1's (central horizontal divider); cols 13 is likely all 1's vertically but not explicitly shown in outputs (may be implicit or overlaid); other areas start as 4's.
 * Flips must be exact: horizontal flip reverses columns; vertical reverses rows; 180 combines both; overlays only set non-4 values from the pattern if the target is 4 (empty) or already matches the value to avoid overwriting mismatches.
 * Top-right quadrant (rows 0-12, cols 14-26) requires a vertical shift (k rows up/down) to find a conflict-free alignment, as direct overlay may overlap with the central column or existing patterns; the shift search loops over possible k (0 to 12) and checks for non-matching non-4 values before placing.
 * Bottom-left (rows 14-26, cols 0-12) uses vertical flip overlaid directly at (14,0), but may need to consider central column overlaps or shifts if patterns extend.
 * Bottom-right (rows 14-26, cols 14-26) uses 180 flip overlaid directly at (14,14), but again, overlaps with central elements or shifted top-right bleed-over could cause issues.
 * Subtlety: The central cross (row 13 all 1's, col 13 all 1's?) acts as a divider that shouldn't be overwritten, and patterns may "bleed" or align across it, requiring conflict checks beyond simple overlay.
 * Non-4 values represent distinct objects/colors that must preserve shape/symmetry; mismatches indicate wrong flip or shift.
 * Grid size is 27x27 exactly (13+1+13), and all outputs must fill exactly without going out of bounds.
 * Overlays are non-destructive: only set if target is 4 or matches; if conflict found during shift search, try next k.
 * Potential miss: Vertical shifts only for top-right; other quadrants may need horizontal shifts or rotations if symmetries are diagonal or rotated.
 * No extraction of "objects" needed beyond the raw top-left slice; patterns are holistic, not individual blobs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def flip_horizontal(p: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [row[::-1] for row in p]

def flip_vertical(p: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return p[::-1]

def flip_180(p: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return flip_horizontal(flip_vertical(p))
```

```python
def overlay_pattern(g: List[List[int]], pattern: List[List[int]], row_start: int, col_start: int):
    n = 13
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            p = pattern[i][j]
            if p != 4:
                r = row_start + i
                c = col_start + j
                if 0 <= r < len(g) and 0 <= c < len(g[0]):  # Bounds check added for safety
                    if g[r][c] == 4:
                        g[r][c] = p
                    # Note: Original only sets if 4, but to match, should check == p too, but code has if g[r][c] == 4: g[r][c] = p (incomplete for matches)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies the quadrant structure, extracts the top-left 13x13 accurately, and applies the right flip types (horizontal for top-right, vertical for bottom-left, 180 for bottom-right).
 * Basic overlay logic works for non-shifted placements, preserving the central row of 1's and not overwriting it.
 * What worked: Top-left remains unchanged; central row stays all 1's; some symmetric elements like 8's and 2/3 pairs in bottom-left/right match expected in partial areas (e.g., rows 4-6 in train 1).
 * What didn't work: Top-right shift logic fails to find the correct k, often defaulting to k=0 or early values, leading to misaligned placements (e.g., in train 1, generated has 1's bleeding into col 13 incorrectly, and bottom-right row 18 has scattered 2's instead of aligned 3's; in train 2, top-right has misaligned 3's and 9's).
 * Direct overlays for bottom quadrants ignore potential conflicts from shifted top-right or central column, causing overwrites (e.g., train 1 generated row 20 has extra 2's in bottom-left where expected has 3's; train 2 generated bottom-right row 20 has isolated 2's instead of extended 9/2 patterns).
 * Shift search in top-right checks only for non-4 conflicts but places even on matches incorrectly (code sets only if 4, but doesn't handle partial overlaps well); it breaks on first non-conflict k, which may not be optimal if later k better aligns overall symmetry.
 * No handling for central column (col 13) being all 1's, leading to invalid overwrites there (e.g., generated often places 1's from patterns into col 13 in top rows).
 * In train 1, generated bottom-right rows 18-20 mismatch expected by having fragmented 2/3/8 patterns (e.g., row 18 generated: 4's with 2's, expected: aligned 3's extending left); reason unknown but likely wrong 180 flip application post-shift bleed.
 * In train 2, generated top-right rows 3-5 have 3's and 8's misaligned (e.g., row 3 col 20: 3 in generated, but expected has it shifted); bottom-left row 23 has extra 2's where expected has 3/8.
 * No object extraction function attempted or needed; raw slicing is sufficient and helpful.
 * The conflict check loop is helpful but buggy (nested breaks may skip full checks; doesn't verify post-placement symmetry).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from training failures: top-right has unshifted or wrongly shifted placements (e.g., rows 0-1 have 2's and 9's in cols 20-26, but without expected alignment, and 1's appear in row 2 col 20-21 mismatched to symmetry).
 * Bottom-left in test has fragmented 1's and 2's (e.g., row 19: 1's in cols 20-21, but as bottom-left should be cols 0-12, this suggests bleed-over or wrong col_start=0; row 19 is actually bottom, but output shows misplaced 1's).
 * Bottom-right shows extended 9's and 2's (rows 20-21 cols 4-11 and 22-25), but row 23 has 2's in cols 18-25 mismatched to expected 8/3 symmetry, indicating 180 flip not resolving overlaps from top-right shift.
 * Central column (col 13) has 1's correctly in row 13, but top rows have 1's placed there from patterns, which shouldn't happen if divider is protected.
 * Overall, test output lacks cohesive symmetry (e.g., 9's in top-right rows 5-6 don't mirror top-left's implied patterns cleanly), and since trainings failed similarly, this likely misaligns the test input's objects like 9's and 3's.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 04:18:17] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** example (both Train 1 and Train 2, across inputs and outputs) and demonstrate clear, consistent influence or effect (e.g., one element affecting another's position, color, size, or count). I ignored isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small single-pixel shapes that vary without pattern, or color introductions like Light Blue that don't universally interact). No high-level puzzle solution or speculation on unknown transformations is included; where a connection's mechanism is unclear but the interaction is consistent, it is noted as "unknown transformation."

#### 1. **Blue Cross Lines → Quadrant Division and Shape Confinement**
   - **Description**: The blue element (holes=0, bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53) forms fixed vertical and horizontal lines that divide the entire 26x26 panel into four consistent 2x2 quadrants (top-left: [0,0,12,12]; top-right: [14,0,26,12]; bottom-left: [0,14,12,26]; bottom-right: [14,14,26,26]).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: This blue element confines all other colored shapes (maroon, red, green) to specific quadrants; no shape crosses quadrant boundaries in any example. It remains unchanged across all inputs and outputs.
   - **Consistency**: Present and identical in every panel of both training examples; directly affects position of all shapes by enforcing quadrant isolation.
   - **Affected Components**: Position (bbox x/y limits) of maroon, red, green rectangles.

#### 2. **Colored Shapes (Maroon/Red/Green) → Yellow Background Pixel Count**
   - **Description**: Yellow backgrounds (holes=1) fill each quadrant completely (bbox matching quadrant bounds, base area ~169 pixels per quadrant).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Overlapping colored shapes (maroon, red, green; holes=0) reduce the yellow pixel count in their quadrant by exactly the sum of the overlapping shapes' pixel counts (assuming no overlaps between shapes themselves). For example, in Train 1 input top-left: yellow pixels=157, shapes total pixels=12 (4+4+4), 169-12=157. This holds for all quadrants.
   - **Consistency**: Exact pixel subtraction occurs in every quadrant of every input and output in both training examples; yellow holes=1 remains constant regardless of overlaps.
   - **Affected Components**: Yellow pixels (decreased by shape pixels); no effect on shape positions or colors.
   - **Note**: Yellow bbox and holes are unaffected; this is a passive overlap effect.

#### 3. **Top-Left Quadrant Shapes → Top-Right Quadrant Shape Addition**
   - **Description**: Top-left quadrant consistently contains multiple stacked or adjacent maroon, red, and/or green rectangles (e.g., vertical/horizontal arrangements at y~3-8, x~3-8).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Colors and relative positions from top-left shapes are copied or mirrored to add new maroon, red, and/or green shapes in the top-right quadrant of the output (e.g., Train 1: top-left maroon/red/green → output top-right adds maroon [20,3,21,4] and green [18,5,19,6]; Train 2: top-left green/maroon/light blue/red/blue → output top-right adds green [20,3,20,4], maroon [21,4,21,4], blue [18,5,19,6]). Existing top-right shapes (usually single red) are preserved.
   - **Consistency**: Addition of at least one matching color from top-left occurs in every output's top-right quadrant; relative vertical positioning (e.g., higher y in top-left → similar y offset in top-right) is mirrored horizontally. No such addition in inputs.
   - **Affected Components**: Top-right position (x~18-22, y matching top-left offsets), color (maroon/red/green from top-left), and pixels (often matching input shape sizes).
   - **Note**: Exact mirroring mechanism (e.g., x-flip offset) is unknown but consistently results in horizontal symmetry.

#### 4. **Top-Left Quadrant Shapes → Bottom Quadrant Shape Addition**
   - **Description**: Top-left quadrant shapes (maroon, red, green stacks/adjacencies).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Colors from top-left are added as new maroon, red, and/or green shapes in both bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants of the output (e.g., Train 1: top-left maroon/red/green → output bottom-left adds green [4,20,4,20]/red [3,20,3,20]/maroon [3,21,3,21]; bottom-right adds green [16,18,18,20]/red [19,18,21,20]; Train 2: similar additions of green/maroon/red/blue/light blue derivatives). Existing bottom shapes (usually small reds) are preserved.
   - **Consistency**: Every output's bottom quadrants gain at least one new shape color matching top-left's set; additions appear in pairs (one per bottom quadrant) with vertical positioning (y~18-26).
   - **Affected Components**: Bottom position (y~18-26, x quadrant-specific: left ~3-5, right ~16-21), color (subset of top-left colors), and pixels (often scaled, e.g., small 1-2 pixels in bottom-left, larger 4-16 in bottom-right).
   - **Note**: Transformation (e.g., rotation, scaling, or reorientation of stack) is unknown but consistently propagates top-left colors downward.

#### 5. **Shape Pixels → Shape Pixels (Preservation in Outputs)**
   - **Description**: Individual maroon, red, green shapes have fixed pixels (e.g., common sizes: 1, 2, 4, 9, 16) and holes=0.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: When shapes are copied or preserved in outputs (e.g., top-left to top-left, existing reds in right/bottom), their exact pixel count is retained (e.g., Train 1 input red [20,5,21,6] pixels=4 → output same; Train 2 input red [5,5,6,6] pixels=4 → output same).
   - **Consistency**: All preserved or directly copied shapes match input pixels exactly in every output; new added shapes may vary but inherit from top-left set.
   - **Affected Components**: Pixels (unchanged for copies); interacts with yellow pixel reduction (see #2).
   - **Note**: No creation of holes (holes=0 consistent for all shapes); bbox may adjust for position but encloses the same pixel area.

#### Unknowns/Non-Connections
- **Color-Specific Transformations**: While colors propagate (e.g., green often appears adjacent to red in stacks), the rule for which color goes where (e.g., green → vertical in bottom-right) is not consistently explainable across both examples without speculation—marked as unknown.
- **Irrelevant Elements**: Single-pixel or isolated reds in bottom-left (e.g., [3,20,3,20] pixels=1) do not consistently interact or propagate; they are preserved but not derived from top-left. Light Blue and extra Blue shapes in Train 2 do not appear in Train 1, so no universal connection. Maroon L-shapes or exact stacking orientations vary without consistent effect.
- **Position → Color Changes**: No consistent evidence that position alone changes color (e.g., y-offset → new color); color propagation ties to top-left overall config, not isolated positions.
- **Panel Sequence Effect**: The three-panel structure (inputs → output) consistently applies transformations only in the final (output) panel, but the exact sequencing rule is unknown.

These connections are derived solely from patterns observable in the provided training data and apply directly to analyzing the test input (e.g., its top-left stack would influence output quadrants via #3 and #4). No further interpretation or solution is attempted.

[2025-10-02 04:19:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two training examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** example (both Train 1 and Train 2, across inputs and outputs) and demonstrate clear, consistent influence or effect (e.g., one element affecting another's position, color, size, or count). I ignored isolated or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small single-pixel shapes that vary without pattern, or color introductions like Light Blue that don't universally interact). No high-level puzzle solution or speculation on unknown transformations is included; where a connection's mechanism is unclear but the interaction is consistent, it is noted as "unknown transformation."

#### 1. **Blue Cross Lines → Quadrant Division and Shape Confinement**
   - **Description**: The blue element (holes=0, bbox=[0,0,26,26], pixels=53) forms fixed vertical and horizontal lines that divide the entire 26x26 panel into four consistent 2x2 quadrants (top-left: [0,0,12,12]; top-right: [14,0,26,12]; bottom-left: [0,14,12,26]; bottom-right: [14,14,26,26]).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: This blue element confines all other colored shapes (maroon, red, green) to specific quadrants; no shape crosses quadrant boundaries in any example. It remains unchanged across all inputs and outputs.
   - **Consistency**: Present and identical in every panel of both training examples; directly affects position of all shapes by enforcing quadrant isolation.
   - **Affected Components**: Position (bbox x/y limits) of maroon, red, green rectangles.

#### 2. **Colored Shapes (Maroon/Red/Green) → Yellow Background Pixel Count**
   - **Description**: Yellow backgrounds (holes=1) fill each quadrant completely (bbox matching quadrant bounds, base area ~169 pixels per quadrant).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Overlapping colored shapes (maroon, red, green; holes=0) reduce the yellow pixel count in their quadrant by exactly the sum of the overlapping shapes' pixel counts (assuming no overlaps between shapes themselves). For example, in Train 1 input top-left: yellow pixels=157, shapes total pixels=12 (4+4+4), 169-12=157. This holds for all quadrants.
   - **Consistency**: Exact pixel subtraction occurs in every quadrant of every input and output in both training examples; yellow holes=1 remains constant regardless of overlaps.
   - **Affected Components**: Yellow pixels (decreased by shape pixels); no effect on shape positions or colors.
   - **Note**: Yellow bbox and holes are unaffected; this is a passive overlap effect.

#### 3. **Top-Left Quadrant Shapes → Top-Right Quadrant Shape Addition**
   - **Description**: Top-left quadrant consistently contains multiple stacked or adjacent maroon, red, and/or green rectangles (e.g., vertical/horizontal arrangements at y~3-8, x~3-8).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Colors and relative positions from top-left shapes are copied or mirrored to add new maroon, red, and/or green shapes in the top-right quadrant of the output (e.g., Train 1: top-left maroon/red/green → output top-right adds maroon [20,3,21,4] and green [18,5,19,6]; Train 2: top-left green/maroon/light blue/red/blue → output top-right adds green [20,3,20,4], maroon [21,4,21,4], blue [18,5,19,6]). Existing top-right shapes (usually single red) are preserved.
   - **Consistency**: Addition of at least one matching color from top-left occurs in every output's top-right quadrant; relative vertical positioning (e.g., higher y in top-left → similar y offset in top-right) is mirrored horizontally. No such addition in inputs.
   - **Affected Components**: Top-right position (x~18-22, y matching top-left offsets), color (maroon/red/green from top-left), and pixels (often matching input shape sizes).
   - **Note**: Exact mirroring mechanism (e.g., x-flip offset) is unknown but consistently results in horizontal symmetry.

#### 4. **Top-Left Quadrant Shapes → Bottom Quadrant Shape Addition**
   - **Description**: Top-left quadrant shapes (maroon, red, green stacks/adjacencies).
   - **Interaction/Effect**: Colors from top-left are added as new maroon, red, and/or green shapes in both bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants of the output (e.g., Train 1: top-left maroon/red/green → output bottom-left adds green [4,20,4,20]/red [3,20,3,20]/maroon [3,21,3,21]; bottom-right adds green [16,18,18,20]/red [19,18,21,20]; Train 2: similar additions of green/maroon/red/blue/light blue derivatives). Existing bottom shapes (usually small reds) are preserved.
   - **Consistency**: Every output's bottom quadrants gain at least one new shape color matching top-left's set; additions appear in pairs (one per bottom quadrant) with vertical positioning (y~18-26).
   - **Affected Components**: Bottom position (y~18-26, x quadrant-specific: left ~3-5, right ~16-21), color (subset of top-left colors), and pixels (often scaled, e.g., small 1-2 pixels in bottom-left, larger 4-16 in bottom-right).
   - **Note**: Transformation (e.g., rotation, scaling, or reorientation of stack) is unknown but consistently propagates top-left colors downward.

#### 5. **Shape Pixels → Shape Pixels (Preservation in Outputs)**
   - **Description**: Individual maroon, red, green shapes have fixed pixels (e.g., common sizes: 1, 2, 4, 9, 16) and holes=0.
   - **Interaction/Effect**: When shapes are copied or preserved in outputs (e.g., top-left to top-left, existing reds in right/bottom), their exact pixel count is retained (e.g., Train 1 input red [20,5,21,6] pixels=4 → output same; Train 2 input red [5,5,6,6] pixels=4 → output same).
   - **Consistency**: All preserved or directly copied shapes match input pixels exactly in every output; new added shapes may vary but inherit from top-left set.
   - **Affected Components**: Pixels (unchanged for copies); interacts with yellow pixel reduction (see #2).
   - **Note**: No creation of holes (holes=0 consistent for all shapes); bbox may adjust for position but encloses the same pixel area.

#### Unknowns/Non-Connections
- **Color-Specific Transformations**: While colors propagate (e.g., green often appears adjacent to red in stacks), the rule for which color goes where (e.g., green → vertical in bottom-right) is not consistently explainable across both examples without speculation—marked as unknown.
- **Irrelevant Elements**: Single-pixel or isolated reds in bottom-left (e.g., [3,20,3,20] pixels=1) do not consistently interact or propagate; they are preserved but not derived from top-left. Light Blue and extra Blue shapes in Train 2 do not appear in Train 1, so no universal connection. Maroon L-shapes or exact stacking orientations vary without consistent effect.
- **Position → Color Changes**: No consistent evidence that position alone changes color (e.g., y-offset → new color); color propagation ties to top-left overall config, not isolated positions.
- **Panel Sequence Effect**: The three-panel structure (inputs → output) consistently applies transformations only in the final (output) panel, but the exact sequencing rule is unknown.

These connections are derived solely from patterns observable in the provided training data and apply directly to analyzing the test input (e.g., its top-left stack would influence output quadrants via #3 and #4). No further interpretation or solution is attempted.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python

    out = [row[:] for row in g]
    add_horizontal_mirror_top(out)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:27:52] Response:
**High level:** This is a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid, where the top-left 13x13 quadrant contains patterned non-4 values (representing shapes or colors like 1,2,3,8,9) amid 4's (likely empty space), with a fixed central row (index 13) of all 1's acting as a divider or axis. The task is to propagate these patterns to the other three 13x13 quadrants via specific mirroring operations—horizontal reflection for the top-right, vertical reflection for the bottom-left, and 180-degree rotation for the bottom-right—while resolving overlaps or conflicts without overwriting the central row or introducing inconsistencies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is divided into four 13x13 quadrants separated by the central row of 1's (row 13, 0-indexed), which must remain unchanged and serves as a symmetry axis; mirrors should not alter it or propagate into it.
 * Mirroring is not simple copy-flip: horizontal mirror (top-right) reflects left-to-right across the vertical axis (column 13); vertical mirror (bottom-left) reflects top-to-bottom across the horizontal axis (row 13); 180-degree mirror (bottom-right) rotates the top-left 180 degrees around the center.
 * Conflicts arise when a mirrored value would overwrite a non-4 cell in the target quadrant that doesn't match; the previous attempt's "shift" logic (adding/subtracting 1 to row/column indices if conflict detected) is a heuristic but fails because it inconsistently skips or misplaces entire rows/columns, leading to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Non-4 values must be preserved and exactly matched in shape/size/orientation across mirrors; 4's are fillers and can be overwritten, but existing non-4's in input (if any) block propagation only if mismatched—though inputs seem to have only top-left filled.
 * Subtlety: Mirrors may overlap at quadrant edges (e.g., near row/column 13), requiring priority (e.g., apply in sequence: horizontal first, then vertical, then 180) or conflict resolution by keeping the "source" value; the central cross (row 13 and column 13) might need special handling to avoid bleeding.
 * Patterns are often symmetric internally (e.g., pairs like 8-8 or 2-2), suggesting blob-like objects that must be reflected as wholes; breaking them (e.g., partial copies) causes mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: The 180 mirror inverts both row and column (tr = n-1-r, tc = n-1-c), but quadrant size (13) means off-by-one errors around the center; also, inputs have no pre-filled values in other quadrants, so all propagation starts from top-left only.
 * Sequence matters: Applying mirrors in wrong order can cause self-overlaps (e.g., vertical mirror affecting what horizontal would place); detect conflicts per cell, not globally.
 * The 1's in the central row might represent a "mirror frame" and could influence adjacency rules, but they aren't propagated.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new helpful functions were introduced in this attempt; the existing mirror functions (add_horizontal_mirror_top, add_vertical_mirror_bottom_left, add_180_mirror_bottom_right) attempt conflict detection via any() loops but are flawed due to global shift logic that skips rows instead of per-cell resolution. The copy step (out = [row[:] for row in g]) is basic but useful for non-destructive editing.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful conflict-check function (not from attempt, but derived for future use)
def check_conflict(out: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, tr: int, tc: int) -> bool:
    return out[tr][tc] != 4 and out[tr][tc] != out[sr][sc]
# Could be used in mirrors to decide overwrite only if no conflict, else skip or resolve.
```

The attempt's functions are not fully helpful as-is (see below); no object-extraction functions were used or proposed, but one might be needed to identify "blobs" (connected non-4 groups) for whole-object mirroring to avoid partial breaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly identifies the quadrant structure (13x13 top-left source, 27 total size) and basic mirror types (horizontal, vertical, 180), and preserves the central row of 1's untouched, which works in all outputs.
 * The copy-to-out and sequential application (horizontal -> vertical -> 180) is a good start, avoiding direct mutation of input.
 * Conflict detection via any() over the quadrant is a reasonable idea for deciding shifts, but it fails because the shift (0 or 1) is applied globally per mirror, causing entire rows to be skipped or offset (e.g., in train 1, bottom-left vertical mirror shifts incorrectly, leading to missing 3's and 2's in rows 18-20).
 * Train 1 generated: Top three rows match expected (all 4's with central 1); rows 3-7 partially match (8's and 2-3 patterns in top-left and mirrors) but bottom-left has extra 8's in row 3 col 20-21 (expected empty), row 18 has only two 2's instead of three, row 19 has 2-2-2 but shifted left without leading 4's/3's, row 20 has single 2 in col 3 (expected 2-3 pattern), row 21 has 8 in col 3 (expected none), and bottom-right has mismatched 8's in rows 22-24 (expected three 8's horizontally). These differences suggest over-propagation or wrong vertical/180 application, unknown why shift triggers incorrectly.
 * Train 2 generated: Top section (rows 0-7) matches expected closely (3's, 8's, 9-2-1 patterns mirrored), central row intact, but bottom half mismatches: row 19 has 2's but expected empty there, row 20 has partial 2's without full extension, rows 21-22 duplicate top-left 9-2-1 but shifted/missing 1's, row 23 has 9-2-1 but expected 1-2-9 flipped, row 24 has 8-3 but incomplete (missing pairs), row 25 has 3's but expected 3-3 pair, row 26 empty but expected 3-3. Differences indicate 180 mirror copies top-left directly without full inversion, and vertical doesn't flip properly; shift logic likely causes partial skips.
 * No object extraction was attempted, but patterns suggest it's needed (e.g., treat 2-2 as a unit); without it, cell-by-cell mirroring breaks connected shapes.
 * The shift heuristic in all three functions is broken/not helpful: it detects any mismatch but responds by offsetting all rows/columns, which distorts positions (e.g., tr = n-1-r + shift skips valid placements); better to resolve per cell (overwrite if target is 4 or matches, else skip).
 * Global quad=13 and n=27 are correct, but range(quad) assumes 0-12 indices without center adjustment.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors patterns (e.g., top-left 3-3-8-8 in rows 2-3 cols 20-26 matches horizontal flip; bottom-left has 2-2-2-9-9-9-9 in row 19 cols 19-26, suggesting vertical flip of top-right; 1-1 pairs in rows 6-7 and 18-19 indicate attempted 180 for bottom-right) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Row 2 has 3-3-8-8 starting at col 20 (good for horizontal), but row 4 has 2-2-2-9x4 in bottom-left (expected vertical flip of row 1's empty? Wait, input not given, but assuming similar to trains, this overfills with unmirrored 9's); rows 5-6 have 9x4-2-2 in bottom-right but asymmetric (9's not paired as in trains); row 7 has 2-1-1 (partial, missing full flip); bottom rows 22-24 have 2-2-2-9x4 but row 23 repeats top-left without 180 inversion (expected rotated version with 1-1-2-2 or similar); empty areas like row 8-12 in bottom have scattered 1's not in expected symmetry. It mismatches because shift logic offsets 180 mirror (e.g., 1's appear in wrong quadrant edges), and no per-cell conflict resolution leads to incomplete blobs (e.g., 9's extend too far without matching source). Without expected test output, it's unclear exact target, but patterns don't consistently reflect wholes (e.g., 9-9-9-9 should be exact flip, not partial), indicating same flaws as trains—likely incorrect.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 04:28:04] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** provided train example (Train input 1 ↔ output 1, Train input 2 ↔ output 2). These are limited to elements that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way, such as through position, color, pixel count, or structural overlap. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., empty quadrants, overall grid silhouette) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., exact color transformations in lower half, which vary by example without a common pattern) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., why y-positions shift slightly in one example during mirroring) are noted but not forced into explanations. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is provided.

- **Blue cross → Yellow backgrounds (structural division and holes)**:  
  The blue cross (bbox spanning [0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) consistently divides the canvas into 4 quadrants and creates a single hole (holes=1) in each yellow background object. This interaction is fixed and unchanged across all inputs/outputs; the cross does not move, resize, or alter pixel count, but its presence directly causes the hole property in yellows. Yellows adjust bbox to avoid cross overlap but inherit the hole from it.

- **Colored blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Light Blue) → Yellow backgrounds (pixel count reduction via coverage)**:  
  When new colored blocks (non-yellow, non-blue-cross) are added within a quadrant's bounds in the output compared to input, the corresponding yellow background's pixel count decreases by exactly the total pixels of those new blocks (e.g., Train 1 upper right: yellow decreases by 8 when Maroon pixels=4 + Green pixels=4 are added; Train 2 lower left: yellow decreases by 36 when Light Blue pixels=8 + Blue pixels=16 + Maroon pixels=4 + Green pixels=8 are added). This coverage interaction is positional (block bbox must overlap the yellow's bbox) and consistent; existing blocks' coverage is already reflected in input yellow pixels, so only additions affect the change. Holes in yellow remain 1 except in one case (Train 2 lower left output: holes=0, unknown reason—possibly related to block density connecting the existing hole, but not consistent across examples).

- **Upper left quadrant colored blocks → Upper right quadrant colored blocks (mirroring by position and color)**:  
  Each colored block (Maroon, Red, Green, Light Blue) in the upper left quadrant (bbox x within ~0-12, y within ~0-12) consistently causes a new block of the **same color** to appear in the upper right quadrant (bbox x within ~14-26, y within ~0-12) at an approximately mirrored x-position across the vertical center (~x=13). Y-position is generally preserved but may shift slightly upward by 1 unit in some cases (consistent pattern in Train 1, exact in Train 2; unknown exact rule for shift). Size (bbox dimensions, pixels) and shape properties (e.g., rectangular, no holes) are preserved. If the mirrored position overlaps an existing block (same or different color), no new block is added (e.g., Train 2: left Red mirrors to existing right Red position, so it stays unchanged). This is a position-to-position and color-to-color interaction; no change to left blocks themselves. Examples: Train 1 Maroon [5,4,6,5] → new Maroon [20,3,21,4]; Train 2 Light Blue [4,5,4,6] → new Light Blue [22,5,22,6].

No other interactions (e.g., lower quadrant block transformations, hole count changes beyond the cross, color-specific effects like Red → Green) are consistent across **every** example, as they vary in color, position, or outcome without a repeatable pattern. For instance, lower half additions occur in both but use different colors (Green/Maroon in Train 1 vs. Light Blue/Blue/Maroon/Green in Train 2) with no shared transformation rule identifiable from positions or properties alone.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 04:30:13] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 28-row by 27-column grid partially filled with colors (integers 1-9 representing shapes or blobs) and 4's as empty/background spaces, featuring a fixed central column (index 13) and central row (index 13) filled with 1's forming a cross; the goal is to complete the grid by applying a symmetry-based rule across the central vertical axis to form coherent patterns or objects, likely mirroring or propagating colors for individual shapes while preserving some asymmetries or shifts in the final output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid symmetry is left-right around column 13 (pairs like column 0 with 26, 1 with 25, ..., 12 with 14), but the expected outputs are not fully symmetric overall—patterns appear mirrored within specific "objects" or blobs of the same color, but these blobs can be shifted vertically (e.g., by 1 row) between left and right sides, and some areas remain one-sided without a mirror.
 * Empty cells (4's) are filled only where they complete a symmetric object, but not blindly; if both symmetric positions are 4 in the input, the program must infer the color from context (e.g., adjacent rows or connected components), as the current attempt fails to do this and leaves them empty when expected has a color.
 * Conflicts occur when symmetric positions both have non-4 colors: the attempt leaves them unchanged, but expected resolves to a specific pattern (e.g., preferring a connected blob's color or reversing order for mirror effect), suggesting object-based completion rather than global overwrite.
 * Patterns involve connected same-color blobs (e.g., 8's forming a shape across 2-4 rows/columns, 2's and 3's forming reversed-mirror shapes like 2-2-3-3 on left matching 3-3-2-2 on right but shifted down by 1 row); subtle shifts and reversals are key, and blobs do not always straddle the center equally.
 * The central cross of 1's is invariant and not to be modified; colors do not propagate into or across the center unless part of a blob.
 * No horizontal symmetry is evident, but vertical shifts suggest possible interaction with the central row; objects seem "drawn" partially on left or right, requiring completion to a symmetric form without overfilling unrelated areas.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have isolated or partial blobs on one side (e.g., 3's appearing only on right without left mirror in some rows), indicating the rule completes only intended objects, not the entire grid; over-mirroring creates extras not in expected.
 * Input likely has sparse hints (some 4's on both sides of pairs), so the program must detect blobs (connected same-color groups, perhaps 4-connected or 8-connected) and extend them symmetrically if incomplete.
 * Row 13 (all 1's) and column 13 (all 1's) act as barriers or fixed elements; colors do not cross them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `make_grid_copy` using `deepcopy` is helpful for non-destructive processing. The `apply_left_right_symmetry` captures the core idea of pairing positions and filling 4's but is incomplete (see unhelpful below); it could be extended to detect blobs first.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

# Potential helpful extension: Extract connected components (blobs) of same color, ignoring 4's and 1's in center.
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Finds connected components (4-connected) of a given color, excluding center cross.
    Returns list of lists of (row, col) positions for each blob.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and not (j == 13 or i == 13):
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and not (ny == 13 or nx == 13):
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies non-4 colors to symmetric 4 positions in cases where only one side has the color (e.g., in training 1 row 4, 8's are filled on right to match left, appearing in generated as 8's on both sides at positions 5-6 left and 20-21 right, which aligns with expected).
 * It fails to fill positions where both symmetric spots are 4 in input but expected requires a color, indicating no inference of missing blob parts (e.g., in training 1 row 3, generated has all 4's on sides, but expected has 8's at right 20-21; likely input had 4's there, but context from adjacent rows demands filling).
 * In conflict cases (both sides non-4 but different), it preserves the input without resolution, leading to mismatches (e.g., training 1 row 5: generated keeps left 8's at 5-6 and right 2's at 20-21, but expected has left 8's at 5-6 and right 3's at 18-19 + 2's at 20-21, so missed filling 18-19 with 3's and didn't reverse/resolve the 8 vs. 2 conflict).
 * For training 1 row 6-7, generated correctly mirrors the 2's and 3's where possible (left 5-8 = 2,2,3,3 to right 18-21 = 3,3,2,2, matching the reversed pattern in expected), showing partial success for connected blobs without conflict.
 * In training 2 row 4-5, it mirrors 3's and 8's correctly in some pairs (e.g., position 6 left 3 to 20 right 3), but fails lower down (e.g., row 20 generated has symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but expected has extended 9's, 2's, and 1's only on left at 2-11, with partial on right in row 21-22, indicating over-mirroring unrelated areas).
 * Training 1 mismatches include missing one-sided fills (e.g., row 18-19 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 at 16-21 in expected, but generated likely left some as 4 if no left mirror); row 20 left adds 2 at 3 and 3 at 4 in expected without right mirror. Unknown why generated row 5 right has only 2's at 20-21 but misses 3's at 18-19—possibly input had 3's but code didn't propagate due to non-empty adjacent or range limit.
 * Training 2 mismatches: generated row 20-23 overfills symmetric 2's, but expected has asymmetric extension (e.g., row 20 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 but right all 4's; row 21 right partial 1,1,2,2,9); row 23-24 generated symmetric 3's/8's, but expected has them only on right or shifted.
 * The `apply_left_right_symmetry` function is partially helpful for pairing and filling empties but broken for conflicts and inference—it collects non-4's before modifying but doesn't overwrite non-4's or detect blobs for extension, leading to incomplete outputs; do not use as-is in future, but adapt for blob detection.
 * No other functions in the attempt; `deepcopy` is reliable but basic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it attempts full left-right mirroring by filling 4's (e.g., row 3 left 3-6=8,8,3,3 mirrored to right 20-23=3,3,8,8; row 4 adds 2's at right 18-20 and 8's at 21-22), creating a mostly symmetric grid, but expected likely follows the same partial, shifted, object-based completion as training (e.g., blobs like 9's in row 5-6 left 1-4=9's mirrored but reversed/shifted on right, with 2's at 5-7 both sides but not overfilled; 1's in row 7-8 at 5-6 both sides). 
 * It overfills symmetries where expected may leave one-sided (e.g., row 20-23 generated symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but test input patterns suggest asymmetric extensions like training 2 row 20); misses potential inferences for empty pairs (e.g., if input has partial 3's or 8's blobs, generated fills only existing mirrors, but expected would complete shifted blobs).
 * The output makes some sense for simple symmetry (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 at 1-4 left to 22-25 right, 2's connected), but looks too uniform/symmetric compared to training expecteds' partial/shifted blobs, suggesting it doesn't handle vertical shifts or object boundaries correctly—likely incorrect as it would fail similar to training cases with missing fills (e.g., if test has empty symmetric pairs needing context fill, they stay 4).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 matrix (with row 13 and column 13 acting as a central divider or cross that is skipped in most operations), where blank cells (4's) are filled based on symmetry, pattern extension, and propagation rules involving specific numbers (e.g., runs of 2's extend to 3's, uniform 2 blocks pair with 9's and 1's, 2 blobs extend to 8's vertically). The goal is to apply a sequence of transformations to complete the grid logically, matching expected patterns in training examples, likely simulating a logic puzzle like a fill-a-pix or region-growing challenge with mirroring across the center.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross (row 13 and column 13) that must be skipped in all operations—no filling or propagation into/out of these positions, and blobs or runs cannot cross them.
 * Mirroring is left-to-right (or symmetric across column 13), but only applies to non-continuation sequences of length >=2 on the left side (columns 0-12), filling 4's on the right (columns 14-26) with reversed sequences if at least one matching non-4 exists on the right to "seed" it; continuations (identical left runs in consecutive rows) are skipped to avoid over-mirroring vertical patterns.
 * Runs of 2's on the left (columns 0-12) can extend rightward into adjacent 4's with 3's (suffix after the run), but only if the extension fits within columns 0-12 without overlapping non-4's.
 * On the right (columns 14-26), runs of 2's can extend leftward (prefix) into 4's with 3's, but only if the prefix fits and is all 4's.
 * Uniform even-length (>=2) runs of 2's on the left extend leftward into 4's with 9's (half the length) and rightward into 4's with 1's (half the length), but only if spaces are all 4's and within bounds (0-12); similar but mirrored logic for right-side 2 runs (1's prefix, 9's suffix), though the suffix logic in the code has bounds issues (e.g., min(nines_start + num9, 27) risks overflow).
 * Vertical propagation fills 4's above (upward) or below (downward) based on non-4 neighbors, but skips the center row/column and only propagates if the source is non-4.
 * Blobs of 2's are extracted as connected components (4-directional adjacency), excluding singles unless it's a single 2; only rectangular blobs (full height x width fill) are extended vertically with 8's—upward for upper-half blobs (min_r <13), downward for lower-half (max_r >13), but only if the extension space (another full rectangle of same size) is all 4's or existing 8's; average column position determines left/right but isn't used in extension.
 * Subtleties: Order of operations matters (e.g., mirroring before completions, propagation after); avoid filling if it would overlap non-4's or cross center; include single 2's as blobs for potential extension but not others; right-side completions have buggy index calculations (e.g., ones_start = run_start - k assumes prefix length k, but code sets to 1's incorrectly in some cases); vertical extension skips if partial (e.g., ext_end_r >26); propagation is bidirectional but applied in passes (up then down).
 * General: All changes must be conservative—only fill 4's, never overwrite non-4's; patterns suggest thematic consistency (e.g., 2's as "cores" extending to borders like 3/8/9/1); test for rectangularity strictly (len(positions) == height * width).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)
```
(Utility for safe modifications; essential to avoid mutating input.)

```python
def get_left_run(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:
    seq = []
    c = 0
    while c < 13 and grid[r][c] != 4:
        seq.append(grid[r][c])
        c += 1
    return c - len(seq), seq  # Returns start column and sequence
```
(Helpful for identifying left-side runs for mirroring/continuations; core to symmetry detection, but assumes runs start at c=0—may need generalization for mid-row runs.)

```python
def is_continuation(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> bool:
    if r == 0:
        return False
    prev_start, prev_seq = get_left_run(grid, r - 1)
    curr_start, curr_seq = get_left_run(grid, r)
    return prev_start == curr_start and prev_seq == curr_seq
```
(Useful for skipping vertical repeats in mirroring; prevents over-filling stacked patterns.)

```python
def propagate_vertical(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = make_grid_copy(grid)
    # Up propagation (fill above from below)
    for r in range(1, 27):
        for c in range(27):
            if r == 13 or c == 13:
                continue
            if g[r - 1][c] == 4 and g[r][c] != 4:
                g[r - 1][c] = g[r][c]
    # Down propagation (fill below from above)
    for r in range(26):
        for c in range(27):
            if r == 13 or c == 13:
                continue
            if g[r][c] != 4 and g[r + 1][c] == 4:
                g[r + 1][c] = g[r][c]
    return g
```
(Helpful for vertical filling; bidirectional and skips center correctly, but may need multiple iterations if chains are long; works well for simple cases but could propagate too early if order is wrong.)

```python
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    rows, cols = 27, 27
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]

```
(Essential for identifying connected 2's as blobs; DFS-based, excludes center, includes single 2's—key for extension rules; could be extended for other colors.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `mirror_left_to_right`: Buggy—has_match check requires a matching non-4 on right, but fills only 4's with reversed seq; skips too aggressively and doesn't handle mid-row starts; leads to under-filling (e.g., no mirroring in train1 row5-12).
- `complete_2_runs_with_3`: Left-side suffix logic overlaps run (c += k -1 buggy); right-side prefix assumes prefix_start = run_start - k, which may not match run length; overfills or skips valid extensions.
- `complete_uniform_2_with_9_1_left`: Assumes even k for uniform 2's, extends prefix with 9's (k//2) and suffix with 1's (k), but suffix end = s_start + k risks exceeding 13; only left-side, ignores non-uniform.
- `complete_2_run_right_with_1_9`: Similar bugs—ones_start = run_start - k (should be half?), nines_start = run_start + k, and bounds check is incomplete (min(...,27) but 27 is out); fills 1's in prefix but code sets to 1's incorrectly for length k instead of half.
- `extend_2_with_8`: Only extends if fully rectangular and space is 4's/8's, but upper extension checks g[er][ec] !=4 and !=8 (should be ==4 or ==8?); lower extension sets to 8 unconditionally if can_extend; avg_c <13.5 unused; doesn't handle partial or non-rect blobs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding of rules but poor implementation.
 * Worked: Vertical propagation correctly fills some chains (e.g., 1's in column 13? Wait, column 13 skipped, but row13 is all 1's untouched); blob extraction identifies 2's for extension; some 3's from 2-runs are placed (e.g., train1 rows 5-12 columns 7-8).
 * Didn't work: Mirroring underperforms—no fills in many expected symmetric spots (e.g., train1 row6 columns 18-19 should be 3,3 but empty); 8's misplaced or missing (train1 generated has 8's in row3 col5-6 and row4 col5-6, but expected has them in row4 col21-22, row5 col21-22, row21 col3, row22 col20-22); extra/unexpected 9's and 1's (train1 row5 col18-19=1,1 but expected empty until later); 3's overextended (train1 row17 col16-18=3,3,3 but expected starts later); right-side 2-run completions buggy, leading to no 9's in train1 row5 col22.
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated fills 8's too early/left (rows3-4 col5-6) vs expected right/lower (rows4-5 col21-22, row21 col3, rows22-24 col20-22); misses 2's in row6 col5-6 and 3's in row6 col7-8; extra 1's in row4 col18-19; lower half 3's/2's shifted wrong (row20 col3=2 but expected row20 empty there).
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in row2 col6 and row4 col6 (expected empty); 8's in row4 col5-6 but expected row4 col5 empty, row5 col21=3,8; fills 1's in row5 col7-8 but expected there; lower half overfills 9's/2's/1's in rows19-26 col2-13 (e.g., row19 col2-3=9,9 but expected row19 empty col2-3); misses 8's in row23 col4-5 and 3's in row24-25 col6-7.
 * Function `complete_2_run_right_with_1_9` is broken (index errors, wrong lengths—e.g., fills full k 1's instead of half); `extend_2_with_8` is partially helpful but buggy (wrong can_extend logic, unused is_left); overall program order (mirror -> left9/1 -> right1/9 -> 3's -> prop -> extend) causes early fills to block later ones.
 * extract_blobs is essential for 2-extension but underused (only for 8's, misses non-rect or multi-color blobs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it overfills the grid with patterns that don't align with training expectations, suggesting rule misapplications (e.g., heavy 9's in rows5-12 col1-4 look like overextended left 2-runs, but training shows more sparse 9's; 8's in rows2-3 col3-4 and row4 col3-4 seem prematurely extended upward without full rectangles; lower half has 1's in row18 col14-17 and 2's/9's in rows19-26 col20-27, but training lower patterns are more contained like row20 col3=2,3 without broad 1's prefix). It appears to propagate too aggressively (e.g., 3's in rows3-12 col16-18 match train but extend to row2 incorrectly); misses potential mirroring (e.g., if input has left 3's, right should symmetric but seems asymmetric). Without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify fully, but it doesn't make sense as a logical completion—too many dense fills (e.g., rows5-12 almost full col0-9 with 9/2/1) vs training's sparser, symmetric results; likely needs better bounds checking and continuation skips to handle test's unique patterns (e.g., longer vertical 2's?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (indices 0-26), where non-empty cells (values other than 4, which seems to represent blanks or empty space) in certain regions are propagated via reflections across the vertical midline, horizontal midline, and main diagonal to fill in corresponding blank cells in symmetric positions, resulting in a fully symmetric completed grid. The goal is to apply these reflections correctly in the right order or iterations to match the expected symmetric patterns in training examples, which include colored shapes (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, 9s) that mirror across quadrants while preserving a central row of 1s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 27x27, with row 13 (0-indexed) fixed as all 1s, acting as a central divider or axis that should not be altered.
 * Reflections are across three axes: vertical (columns symmetric around c=13), horizontal (rows symmetric around r=13), and diagonal (both r and c symmetric around 13), but the current implementation only partially fills blanks (4s) without ensuring full propagation or handling overlaps/multiple reflections per cell.
 * Only copy non-4 values to 4 positions; do not overwrite existing non-4 values, but the order of reflections matters—e.g., upper-right first may not propagate fully if later reflections depend on prior fills.
 * Subtlety: Reflections seem to be one-way (from source to target if target is 4), but may need to be bidirectional or repeated in loops until no changes occur, as partial fills in one step can enable further propagation.
 * Patterns represent shapes (e.g., blobs of 2s, 3s) that must mirror exactly, including size and position; mismatches occur when shapes are incomplete (e.g., missing extensions like three 2s instead of two, or incorrect positioning across the center).
 * The central row (all 1s) and column interactions: values near the center may need special handling to avoid overwriting the 1s row.
 * Grid has quadrants divided by the center lines; upper-left influences lower-right via diagonal, but current code doesn't fully symmetrize all pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs extend shapes horizontally or vertically across more cells (e.g., three 3s and three 2s in row 19-20 of training 1), suggesting reflections must propagate chains of values, not just single cells.
 * No rotation or other transformations; strictly reflections, and 4s are placeholders to be filled, not propagated themselves.
 * Potential for overfilling: If a cell gets filled multiple times from different reflections, it should stabilize to the correct value, but current code doesn't iterate.

    return list(shapes.values())
```
# Note: This flood-fill could help verify symmetry by checking if shapes mirror across axes, but it's not used in the current program.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used three one-way reflection functions (upper-right vertical, bottom-left horizontal, bottom-right diagonal), applied sequentially without iteration, which partially filled some symmetric positions but failed to propagate full shapes (e.g., in training 1, generated two 2s where expected three, and misplaced 8s/3s in lower rows).
 * Worked: Correctly identified the three symmetry axes and conditional filling (only to 4s from non-4s), and preserved the central row of 1s; some upper-left patterns were mirrored to upper-right and bottom-left correctly (e.g., 8s in rows 4-5).
 * Did not work: Incomplete propagation—e.g., in training 1, row 19 expected three 2s and three 3s extending rightward, but generated only two; row 20 had incorrect 2 at col 3 instead of expected 2 at col 3 but missing extensions; diagonal reflection didn't fully mirror shapes across center (e.g., 8s in row 21-22 expected three-wide but generated two).
 * In training 2, generated partial mirrors (e.g., 2s and 9s in rows 5-6 mirrored somewhat, but row 20 had extra 2s where expected 9s/1s chain; row 23 had 3s/8s misplaced); failed to extend shapes like four 2s into proper symmetric blocks with 1s and 9s.
 * Order of reflections caused issues: upper-right first filled verticals prematurely, but horizontal/diagonal didn't update based on those changes, leading to asymmetries (e.g., unknown reason for 1s appearing in wrong positions in row 5 col 20-21 of training 2 generated vs. expected).
 * No iteration: Single pass per reflection means chained fills (e.g., a fill enabling another reflection) are missed.
 * Loops only over range(13) instead of 27, limiting to half-grid and missing bidirectional or full coverage.
 * Function reflect_upper_right is helpful for vertical symmetry but incomplete (one-way, half-range); similar for others—keep but extend to bidirectional and full range.
 * No shape extraction used, which might help debug by verifying mirrored blobs, but not essential yet.
 * Central row handling is correct (not overwritten), but interactions near row/col 13 are subtle and sometimes lead to partial fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially symmetrizes but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete shape extensions similar to training failures—e.g., row 4 has two 8s and two 3s mirrored to row 23, but expected likely needs three-wide for 2s/3s based on training patterns (row 4 generated: 8,8,3,3 but test input suggests larger blobs); row 5 has two 2s where patterns imply more.
 * In rows 5-6, 9s and 2s are mirrored vertically and diagonally, but only two 2s each instead of potentially three or four to match shape completeness seen in expected trainings; 1s in rows 7-8 and 19-20 appear symmetric but isolated, possibly missing connections to central patterns.
 * Lower half (rows 19-24) has partial mirrors (e.g., row 21 two 2s, row 23 two 8s/3s), but asymmetries like row 4's 8s/3s not fully propagating to row 23's expected extended form; overall, it looks like 70% symmetric but misses chain propagations, making it incorrect without expected to confirm, but inconsistent with training expectations for full shape mirroring.
 * The output preserves the central 1s row correctly, which is good, but fails to handle larger blobs (e.g., four 9s in row 6 not fully mirrored horizontally in lower rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid divided by central lines at row 13 and column 13, where patterns (sequences or "blobs" of numbers representing colors like 1,2,3,8,9) on the left side (columns 0-12) are mirrored, extended, or transformed to the right side (columns 14-26) and sometimes downward, following rules for symmetry, continuations from above rows, prefixing runs of 2's with 3's, and adding blocks of 8's below certain 2-blobs, while leaving 4's as empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed dividers: all of row 13 and column 13 are filled with 1's, and patterns do not cross these lines (e.g., blobs skip column 13 and row 13 in extraction).
 * Mirroring from left to right applies to sequences of non-4 cells in a row, but only if they are not exact continuations of the same sequence from the row above (to avoid over-mirroring vertical stacks); reversed sequences are placed starting from the symmetric position on the right (e.g., for a sequence ending at column j on left, mirror starts at 26 - (j- something)).
 * For runs of 2's on the right side (columns 14+), if length >=2, prefix them with an equal-length run of 3's immediately to the left (in columns 13+), but only fill 4's without conflicts.
 * Below blobs of 2's (connected components, ignoring dividers), add vertical extensions of 8's in the rows immediately below the blob's bottom row, matching the blob's horizontal width, but only in empty (4) cells; also handle partial fills like a single 8 at specific positions (e.g., column 3 in the first extension row).
 * Complete partial extensions: if a 2 on the left (columns 0-12) is followed by a 4 to its right, fill that 4 with 3 (suggesting a "partial left two" rule for incomplete mirrors).
 * Subtlety: For uniform-color sequences (all same number) of length >=2 (except color 1), if not a continuation, extend upward into the previous row's mirror area if empty.
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same color, excluding divider cells; only blobs with size >1 are considered for extensions.
 * Conflicts in mirroring: if a mirror position already has a non-4 that doesn't match the expected reversed value, skip filling; partial matches (some cells already correct) may still allow filling the rest.
 * Order of operations matters: mirroring first, then completing 2-runs with 3-prefixes, then adding 8-blocks below 2-blobs, then partial left completions.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side patterns can influence left-side fills (e.g., 3-prefixes extend leftward into column 14- but wait, code has i=14, filling left to c=i-1-p >=14? Wait, seems buggy); also, 9's and other colors like 1's may have special non-mirroring behavior.
 * Vertical influences: Check for continuations only upward (r-1), not downward; 8-extensions are strictly below and don't mirror.
 * Grid is 27 rows x 27 cols, but patterns are sparse; row 13 is all 1's, column 13 all 1's in output.

                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented mirroring of left sequences to right (reversed), but skipped fills too aggressively on continuations and conflicts, leading to incomplete right-side patterns in both training examples.
 * Worked: Basic mirroring for non-continuation sequences (e.g., in training 1, correctly placed some 8's below and 2's/3's on right); extracted 2-blobs correctly for 8-extensions in some positions (e.g., rows 20-22 in training 1 match expected 8's).
 * Didn't work: In training 1, row 5 (0-indexed) generated [3,3,2,2] starting at col 19 but expected starts at col 18 with [3,3,2,2]; also added extra 2 at row 20 col 23 which expected lacks; row 6 has correct but overall mismatches in 3-prefix positioning.
 * In training 1, failed to prefix 2-runs with 3's correctly in rows 18-19 (generated correct, but row 20 has misplaced 2/3); also added 8 at row 3 col 20-21 which expected has, but extra 8's elsewhere.
 * In training 2, mirroring introduced incorrect 3's and 8's in left side (e.g., row 3 col 6=3 but expected 4? Wait, expected has 3 at row 3 col 20); over-extended 8-blocks to width 4 in rows 23-26 but expected varies (e.g., row 23 has 8's at col 19-22, but generated has at 19-22 correctly? Wait, mismatches in row 20-22 with extra 2's and 3's on left).
 * In training 2, complete_two_runs_with_three_prefix filled 3's leftward from right 2's but started at i=14 and filled to c>=14, which is buggy (should fill into left? But code fills left from i, yet i=14 is right side); led to no fills in some prefix spots.
 * add_eight_block_below_two_blob worked partially (added 8's below 2-blobs in right side), but over-added vertically (e.g., in training 2, extended to row 26 but expected stops earlier) and added partial 8 at col 3 incorrectly or missed.
 * complete_partial_left_two only checked cols 0-12 for 2 followed by 4, filling with 3, but missed cases where partials are deeper or on right.
 * extract_blobs is helpful and correct for finding connected 2-groups, but only used for color=2; could extend to other colors.
 * mirror_left_to_right has logic for uniform color upward extension, but condition "all(x == sequence[0] for x in sequence) and sequence[0] != 1" skipped color=1 correctly but over-applied for 2's in some vertical stacks.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of mirroring and blob extensions but bugs in prefixing (wrong starting columns, conflicts), over-filling 8's, and missing subtle position shifts (e.g., 3-prefixes start one column left of 2-run).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors left patterns to right (e.g., row 3: left 8,8,3,3 -> right 3,3,8,8 correctly reversed; row 5-6: 9's and 2's mirrored with length 4 each), adds 8's below 2-blobs in rows 23-26 cols 19-22, and prefixes some 3's before 2's in rows 20-22 cols 14-19.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4, right side has 2,2,2 at cols 19-21 but no 3-prefix before them (expected likely 3's at cols 16-18 or similar based on training patterns); row 7-8 have 1,1 on right but left has 1,1 at cols 5-6, suggesting incomplete mirroring or continuation skip error.
 * Row 20-22: 3's and 2's prefixed correctly on right, but row 22 has 2,3 on left cols 5-6 which seems like a partial fill error (complete_partial_left_two may have over-applied); expected likely no left changes there.
 * 8-block in rows 23-26 cols 19-22 looks correct for below 2's in row 19? But test input not shown, assuming based on patterns—partial 8 at row 23 col 4? Code has no such fill, but earlier partial rule mentions col 3.
 * Missing upward extensions for uniform sequences (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 might need upward if applicable); overall, test output has more fills than expected in left partials and incomplete prefixes, suggesting same prefix bug as training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (with row 13 and column 13 as dividers or barriers) where blank cells (4s) are filled based on pattern completion rules involving symmetry (mirroring left-to-right across the center), sequence extensions (e.g., completing 2s with 3s as prefixes/suffixes), blob extensions (adding 8s to rectangular groups of 2s), and special fillings for even-width rectangular 2-blobs (adding 9s and 1s). The goal is to apply these rules in a specific order to match the expected completed grid without overwriting existing non-4 cells unless specified.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross (row 13 and column 13) that must be skipped or treated as barriers; no filling occurs there, and blobs cannot cross them.
 * Left side (columns 0-12) and right side (14-26) are handled semi-independently but with mirroring: sequences on left can be reversed and placed on right if they start after column 13, but only if not a direct vertical continuation from the row above, and only overwrite if the sequence contains 1,3, or 9.
 * Sequence extraction (get_sequence) finds contiguous non-4 runs starting from a column, but mirroring requires symmetric positioning (e.g., end_left mirrored to start_right = 26 - end_left) and skips if start_right < 14.
 * Completing 2s with 3s: On left, add 3-suffix after a run of 2s if space allows and blanks; on right, add 3-prefix before a run of 2s, but skip rows with any 9 on left. Length of 3-run matches 2-run length (k).
 * Blobs of 2s are only extended if rectangular (h * w == blob size), and 8s are added above (for upper blobs) or below (for lower blobs) in matching widths, but only on blanks; no diagonal or irregular shapes.
 * For even-width rectangular 2-blobs on left (w >=2, even, fully within 0-12), add w/2 9s to the left and w 1s to the right; symmetric on right but mirrored (9s outside right, 1s inside leftward).
 * Order matters: complete rectangular 2-blobs first, then left 3-suffixes, then mirror, then right 3-prefixes, then add 8s—running out of order can cause overwrites or misses.
 * Subtle: "Overwrite" in mirroring only if seq has 1/3/9, but still checks for 4 or overwrite condition; blobs exclude single cells (len(blob)>1); no filling if prefix/suffix would go outside bounds or overlap non-4s.
 * Vertical continuity check (is_continuation) prevents redundant mirroring if the exact sequence repeats from row above at same start column.
 * All operations preserve existing non-4 cells; 4s are blanks to fill.
 * Easy to miss: Rectangular check is strict (no holes or irregular); 8-extensions are vertical only (same columns); mirroring skips short sequences or those too close to center; right-side 3-prefix skips rows with left 9s to avoid conflicts.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) partially understands mirroring and blob extraction but fails on sequence completion and ordering, leading to incorrect 3-placements and missed 8-extensions in both training examples.
 * For Training 1: Generated incorrectly places 9s and 2s in row 6 left (expected 2s further left without 9s there), adds extra 1s in row 5 right where expected 3s, misses 8 in row 3 right col 21-22 (generated 4s), places 3s in row 18-20 left starting too early (expected from col 14), and adds 8 in row 21 left col 3 where expected nothing; also row 6 right has 1,1,2,2,9 but expected 3,3,2,2,4. These differences suggest over-aggressive mirroring without proper continuation checks and wrong 3-prefix logic.
 * For Training 2: Generated places 3s in row 4 left col 6 (unexpected, expected nothing), adds 1s in row 5-6 left cols 7-8 where expected nothing, over-extends 8s in rows 23-26 right (expected 3s mixed in), places 1s in row 20 right where expected nothing, and misses 3s in row 23 right cols 20-21 (generated 8s); row 23 left has 8,8,3,3 but expected nothing there. Issues include faulty rectangular 2-blob detection (wrong widths for 9/1 filling) and 3-prefix overwriting existing patterns.
 * Function `mirror_left_to_right` is partially helpful but broken: it overwrites too eagerly (e.g., places reversed seq even on non-4s if condition met) and skips valid mirrors if start_right <14 incorrectly; needs tighter bounds and continuation logic.
 * Function `complete_right_two_with_three_prefix` is unhelpful/broken: skips rows with left 9s correctly but fills 3s in wrong positions (e.g., too far right or overwriting), and loop starts from c=26 but decrements without proper start detection.
 * Function `complete_left_two_with_three_suffix` has similar issues: fills 3s but increments c incorrectly after fill, leading to missed or extra suffixes.
 * Function `add_eight_blocks` is helpful for blob extension but limited: only vertical, rectangular, and direction based on blob position (upper adds above, lower below), but misses some (e.g., Train1 row3 right) due to prior wrong fillings; doesn't handle mixed upper/lower well.
 * Function `complete_rectangular_two_blobs` is mostly helpful for 9/1 additions but buggy on right side: mirrors incorrectly (adds 9s outward but 1s inward with wrong counts), and assumes even w but doesn't check vertical alignment strictly.
 * Overall, attempt shows core understanding of blobs and mirroring but fails on order (e.g., mirroring before all completions causes chain errors) and boundary conditions (e.g., col 12/14 edges); extract_blobs is essential and correct for identifying groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It overfills with 9s in rows 5-6 left (four 9s wide, but expected fewer or none based on patterns), places 1s in rows 7-8 left cols 5-6 unexpectedly (likely wrong mirroring of 2s), adds 3s in row 4 right cols 14-17 where a prefix for 2s in 19-21 might be intended but positioning seems off (expected possibly shifted), extends 8s in row 2 left cols 3-4 and row 20-23 right cols 18-21 but misses potential upper extensions above row 2; row 20-22 left has 1s and 2s with 9s that look like over-mirrored from right 2s without continuation check. These suggest the program applies rules but in wrong sequence, causing asymmetric fills (e.g., left 9s not mirrored properly to right 1s) and extra blobs; does not match expected symmetry or completion as rules would dictate cleaner 3-prefixes and rectangular 8s without extras.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual symmetry puzzle on a 27x27 grid divided into four quadrants (top-left 0-12 rows/cols, top-right 0-12 rows/13-26 cols, bottom-left 13-26 rows/0-12 cols, bottom-right 13-26 rows/13-26 cols), where the goal is to mirror shapes from the top-left quadrant into the other three quadrants using reflections across axes, with special handling for a "red" anchor shape (color 2) that may resize or position blocks relative to it, and flips for x/y axes depending on the target quadrant. The grid uses 4 as background, 1 as a central horizontal divider (row 13), and other colors (e.g., 2,3,8,9) for distinct shapes or blocks that must be copied, flipped, and potentially adjusted for attachments or overlaps without corrupting the background or divider.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Reflections must preserve shape integrity but apply flips: top-right flips horizontally (x-axis mirror), bottom-left and bottom-right flip vertically (y-axis mirror) and possibly adjust for "bottom" orientation, which may invert attachments (e.g., above becomes below).
 * Color 2 (red) is special: it acts as an anchor; if absent in target, copy and flip it from source; if present, use its bounding box to position/resize other blocks relative to attachments (left/right for horizontal, above/below for vertical), adjusting heights/widths based on original red size (e.g., h_new = max(1, h_t - h + orig_red_h) to fit around it).
 * Attachments are crucial: detect if source block touches red on left/right/above/below; if attached, place target block accordingly (e.g., left_attach places to the left of target red, flipping position for bottom quadrants); if not attached, default to full-grid flip (using 26 - coord for mirroring across center).
 * Avoid overlaps: the has_overlap function checks for non-background/non-divider/non-color cells in target area, but it's underused; filling must not overwrite 1 or 4, and shapes shouldn't bleed across quadrants or the divider.
 * Bounding boxes (bbox) must be precise: min/max r/c for each color block in source/target; empty bbox means skip or handle specially (e.g., no red in target triggers full copy/flip).
 * Subtle grid bounds: reflections use 0-12 source, but targets adjust (e.g., top-right cols 14-26); flips use 26 - max/min for centering; bottom quadrants treat row 13 as divider, so vertical placements may shift down (e.g., above_attach in bottom flips to below red).
 * Shapes are solid blocks (rectangular fills), not pixel-perfect; multiple same-color blocks aren't split—treat per color bbox.
 * Easy to miss: when red exists in target, non-attached blocks still flip relative to whole grid, not red; for bottom, horizontal attachments don't flip x, but vertical do y-invert; resize only for attached blocks to "fill gaps" around red; ignore 1 and 4 in color extraction.
 * Order matters: apply reflections sequentially (top-right first, then bottom-left, then bottom-right), as each modifies the grid cumulatively.
 * Potential bugs: fill function clamps to grid (0 to len-1), but may clip shapes; get_colors excludes 1/4 correctly, but doesn't handle multi-block same color; attachment detection uses overlap checks (y_overlap = max(minr, minr_s) <= min(maxr, maxr_s)), but fails if blocks touch edges without overlap.

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_colors(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> set:

        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] not in (1, 4):
                colors.add(g[r][c])
    return colors
```
(Extracts unique non-background/divider colors in a region; helpful for identifying shapes to reflect.)

```python
def get_bbox(g: List[List[int]], color: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1) for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1) if g[r][c] == color]
    if not positions:
        return None
    minr = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    maxr = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    minc = min(c for _, c in positions)
    maxc = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return minr, maxr, minc, maxc
```
(Computes tight bounding box for a color in a region; essential for positioning/reflecting individual shapes accurately.)

```python
def fill(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, color: int):
    for r in range(max(0, min_r), min(len(g) - 1, max_r) + 1):
        for c in range(max(0, min_c), min(len(g[0]) - 1, max_c) + 1):
            g[r][c] = color
```
(Fills a rectangular area with a color, clamping to grid bounds; useful for placing reflected shapes, but ensure no overwrite of 1/4.)

```python
def has_overlap(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, color: int) -> bool:
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= r < len(g) and 0 <= c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] not in (1, 4) and g[r][c] != color:
                return True
    return False
```
(Checks if target area has conflicting colors before filling; helpful for avoiding corruption, but underutilized in the main logic—could prevent bad placements.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding of quadrant reflections and flips (e.g., top-right horizontal flip works somewhat, as upper 8s and 2/3 placements are close in training 1), but fails on attachment/resizing logic for red (2), leading to mispositioned or oversized blocks in bottom quadrants.
 * In training 1: Generated places 8s correctly in top-right (rows 4-5, cols 20-21 matching expected), but upper 2/3 in rows 6-7 are correct; however, bottom-left has extra/wrong 8s in rows 15-17 cols 19-22 (expected empty there, has 8s instead of 4s), and row 20 has 2/3 extended to col 23-25 incorrectly (expected only to col 22); row 18-20 2/3 are shifted right vs. expected left-aligned under divider; upper row 3 has 8s in cols 20-21 but expected in row 4 only—timing of reflections overwrites partially.
 * In training 1: Bottom-right row 22 has single 8 in col 3 (generated) vs. expected none; row 20-21 2/3 in cols 19-25 generated vs. expected cols 18-22; unknown reason for 3s in row 21 col 22-25 (mismatch in flip/resize).
 * In training 2: Upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8/3 in rows 4-5 correct, 2/1/9 in rows 5-6 flipped horizontally ok), but bottom-left row 19 has 9/2 misplaced (generated cols 18-21 vs. expected none, expected shapes higher); row 20-21 9/2/1 in cols 16-23 generated vs. expected cols 20-26 flipped; bottom-right row 23-26 3s extended wrongly (generated full row 22-26 cols 4-11 vs. expected partial and positioned differently).
 * In training 2: Row 16-18 bottom-left empty in generated but expected 8/3 placements; attachment detection fails, placing non-attached blocks as attached (e.g., 9s treated as left-attached to non-existent red).
 * Sequential reflection order causes cumulative errors: top-right ok, but bottom-left overwrites with wrong y-flips, bottom-right inherits errors.
 * reflect_quadrant function is overly complex and buggy (e.g., red handling assumes orig_red_h/w from source even if no source red; attachment logic inverts wrongly for bottom (e.g., above_attach sets minr_new = maxr_t +1 but doesn't adjust h_new consistently); skips red copy if has_red_target but doesn't verify).
 * get_colors and get_bbox are helpful and mostly correct (accurate for single-block colors), but fill ignores overlap checks, leading to background corruption (e.g., overwriting 4s with shapes in wrong spots).
 * has_overlap is defined but not called in reflect_quadrant, so useless in practice—add it before fill to skip or adjust placements.
 * No handling for multi-component same-color shapes (bbox takes whole, but if disconnected, it merges wrongly—though examples seem connected).
 * Program assumes fixed quadrants (0-12/14-26), correct for 27x27 with 1-col/row divider at 13, but doesn't protect row 13 from fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it partially mirrors top-left shapes (e.g., 8/3 in rows 3-4 cols 3-7 flipped to top-right cols 20-24 ok, 9/2 in rows 5-6 cols 1-6 to bottom-right cols 18-23), but bottom-left has 3s in rows 15-18 cols 18-20 (unexpected, as source has no direct vertical mirror there—likely false attachment placing 3s relative to phantom red); row 7-8 has 1s in cols 5-6 (corrupting background, expected 4s); bottom-right row 19-22 has oversized 9/2/8 blocks (e.g., row 19 cols 12-19 9s extended beyond expected flip of source 9/2, and 8s in cols 22-26 too wide vs. source 8s); row 20 has 2 in col 5 (stray, not in expected symmetry); upper row 3 8s in cols 20-21 ok but row 4 8s overlap wrongly with 9/2; overall, lacks proper red anchoring (no color 2 in source visible, but generated places 2s in bottom without source, and resizes fail leading to protrusions into divider/background). This suggests the reflection logic over-applies flips without checking source red presence, and attachment detection misfires for vertical bottom placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual symmetry puzzle on a 27x27 grid (divided into four 13x13 quadrants separated by a central row of 1's at row 13 and a central column of 1's implied at col 13, though the middle row spans all columns), where the top-left quadrant provides a base pattern of numbers (1-9 representing colors/objects, 4 as empty), and the goal is to mirror it into the other three quadrants using horizontal, vertical, and 180-degree flips, while resolving overlaps by prioritizing non-4 values only if they match or the target is empty, and potentially applying vertical shifts in the top-right to align without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid structure is fixed: rows 0-12 and cols 0-12 are given (top-left); row 13 is all 1's (central horizontal divider); cols 13 is likely all 1's vertically but not explicitly shown in outputs (may be implicit or overlaid); other areas start as 4's.
 * Flips must be exact: horizontal flip reverses columns; vertical reverses rows; 180 combines both; overlays only set non-4 values from the pattern if the target is 4 (empty) or already matches the value to avoid overwriting mismatches.
 * Top-right quadrant (rows 0-12, cols 14-26) requires a vertical shift (k rows up/down) to find a conflict-free alignment, as direct overlay may overlap with the central column or existing patterns; the shift search loops over possible k (0 to 12) and checks for non-matching non-4 values before placing.
 * Bottom-left (rows 14-26, cols 0-12) uses vertical flip overlaid directly at (14,0), but may need to consider central column overlaps or shifts if patterns extend.
 * Bottom-right (rows 14-26, cols 14-26) uses 180 flip overlaid directly at (14,14), but again, overlaps with central elements or shifted top-right bleed-over could cause issues.
 * Subtlety: The central cross (row 13 all 1's, col 13 all 1's?) acts as a divider that shouldn't be overwritten, and patterns may "bleed" or align across it, requiring conflict checks beyond simple overlay.
 * Non-4 values represent distinct objects/colors that must preserve shape/symmetry; mismatches indicate wrong flip or shift.
 * Grid size is 27x27 exactly (13+1+13), and all outputs must fill exactly without going out of bounds.
 * Overlays are non-destructive: only set if target is 4 or matches; if conflict found during shift search, try next k.
 * Potential miss: Vertical shifts only for top-right; other quadrants may need horizontal shifts or rotations if symmetries are diagonal or rotated.
 * No extraction of "objects" needed beyond the raw top-left slice; patterns are holistic, not individual blobs.

            p = pattern[i][j]
            if p != 4:
                r = row_start + i
                c = col_start + j
                if 0 <= r < len(g) and 0 <= c < len(g[0]):  # Bounds check added for safety
                    if g[r][c] == 4:
                        g[r][c] = p
                    # Note: Original only sets if 4, but to match, should check == p too, but code has if g[r][c] == 4: g[r][c] = p (incomplete for matches)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies the quadrant structure, extracts the top-left 13x13 accurately, and applies the right flip types (horizontal for top-right, vertical for bottom-left, 180 for bottom-right).
 * Basic overlay logic works for non-shifted placements, preserving the central row of 1's and not overwriting it.
 * What worked: Top-left remains unchanged; central row stays all 1's; some symmetric elements like 8's and 2/3 pairs in bottom-left/right match expected in partial areas (e.g., rows 4-6 in train 1).
 * What didn't work: Top-right shift logic fails to find the correct k, often defaulting to k=0 or early values, leading to misaligned placements (e.g., in train 1, generated has 1's bleeding into col 13 incorrectly, and bottom-right row 18 has scattered 2's instead of aligned 3's; in train 2, top-right has misaligned 3's and 9's).
 * Direct overlays for bottom quadrants ignore potential conflicts from shifted top-right or central column, causing overwrites (e.g., train 1 generated row 20 has extra 2's in bottom-left where expected has 3's; train 2 generated bottom-right row 20 has isolated 2's instead of extended 9/2 patterns).
 * Shift search in top-right checks only for non-4 conflicts but places even on matches incorrectly (code sets only if 4, but doesn't handle partial overlaps well); it breaks on first non-conflict k, which may not be optimal if later k better aligns overall symmetry.
 * No handling for central column (col 13) being all 1's, leading to invalid overwrites there (e.g., generated often places 1's from patterns into col 13 in top rows).
 * In train 1, generated bottom-right rows 18-20 mismatch expected by having fragmented 2/3/8 patterns (e.g., row 18 generated: 4's with 2's, expected: aligned 3's extending left); reason unknown but likely wrong 180 flip application post-shift bleed.
 * In train 2, generated top-right rows 3-5 have 3's and 8's misaligned (e.g., row 3 col 20: 3 in generated, but expected has it shifted); bottom-left row 23 has extra 2's where expected has 3/8.
 * No object extraction function attempted or needed; raw slicing is sufficient and helpful.
 * The conflict check loop is helpful but buggy (nested breaks may skip full checks; doesn't verify post-placement symmetry).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from training failures: top-right has unshifted or wrongly shifted placements (e.g., rows 0-1 have 2's and 9's in cols 20-26, but without expected alignment, and 1's appear in row 2 col 20-21 mismatched to symmetry).
 * Bottom-left in test has fragmented 1's and 2's (e.g., row 19: 1's in cols 20-21, but as bottom-left should be cols 0-12, this suggests bleed-over or wrong col_start=0; row 19 is actually bottom, but output shows misplaced 1's).
 * Bottom-right shows extended 9's and 2's (rows 20-21 cols 4-11 and 22-25), but row 23 has 2's in cols 18-25 mismatched to expected 8/3 symmetry, indicating 180 flip not resolving overlaps from top-right shift.
 * Central column (col 13) has 1's correctly in row 13, but top rows have 1's placed there from patterns, which shouldn't happen if divider is protected.
 * Overall, test output lacks cohesive symmetry (e.g., 9's in top-right rows 5-6 don't mirror top-left's implied patterns cleanly), and since trainings failed similarly, this likely misaligns the test input's objects like 9's and 3's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid, where the top-left 13x13 quadrant contains patterned non-4 values (representing shapes or colors like 1,2,3,8,9) amid 4's (likely empty space), with a fixed central row (index 13) of all 1's acting as a divider or axis. The task is to propagate these patterns to the other three 13x13 quadrants via specific mirroring operations—horizontal reflection for the top-right, vertical reflection for the bottom-left, and 180-degree rotation for the bottom-right—while resolving overlaps or conflicts without overwriting the central row or introducing inconsistencies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is divided into four 13x13 quadrants separated by the central row of 1's (row 13, 0-indexed), which must remain unchanged and serves as a symmetry axis; mirrors should not alter it or propagate into it.
 * Mirroring is not simple copy-flip: horizontal mirror (top-right) reflects left-to-right across the vertical axis (column 13); vertical mirror (bottom-left) reflects top-to-bottom across the horizontal axis (row 13); 180-degree mirror (bottom-right) rotates the top-left 180 degrees around the center.
 * Conflicts arise when a mirrored value would overwrite a non-4 cell in the target quadrant that doesn't match; the previous attempt's "shift" logic (adding/subtracting 1 to row/column indices if conflict detected) is a heuristic but fails because it inconsistently skips or misplaces entire rows/columns, leading to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Non-4 values must be preserved and exactly matched in shape/size/orientation across mirrors; 4's are fillers and can be overwritten, but existing non-4's in input (if any) block propagation only if mismatched—though inputs seem to have only top-left filled.
 * Subtlety: Mirrors may overlap at quadrant edges (e.g., near row/column 13), requiring priority (e.g., apply in sequence: horizontal first, then vertical, then 180) or conflict resolution by keeping the "source" value; the central cross (row 13 and column 13) might need special handling to avoid bleeding.
 * Patterns are often symmetric internally (e.g., pairs like 8-8 or 2-2), suggesting blob-like objects that must be reflected as wholes; breaking them (e.g., partial copies) causes mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: The 180 mirror inverts both row and column (tr = n-1-r, tc = n-1-c), but quadrant size (13) means off-by-one errors around the center; also, inputs have no pre-filled values in other quadrants, so all propagation starts from top-left only.
 * Sequence matters: Applying mirrors in wrong order can cause self-overlaps (e.g., vertical mirror affecting what horizontal would place); detect conflicts per cell, not globally.
 * The 1's in the central row might represent a "mirror frame" and could influence adjacency rules, but they aren't propagated.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new helpful functions were introduced in this attempt; the existing mirror functions (add_horizontal_mirror_top, add_vertical_mirror_bottom_left, add_180_mirror_bottom_right) attempt conflict detection via any() loops but are flawed due to global shift logic that skips rows instead of per-cell resolution. The copy step (out = [row[:] for row in g]) is basic but useful for non-destructive editing.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful conflict-check function (not from attempt, but derived for future use)
def check_conflict(out: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, tr: int, tc: int) -> bool:
    return out[tr][tc] != 4 and out[tr][tc] != out[sr][sc]
# Could be used in mirrors to decide overwrite only if no conflict, else skip or resolve.
```

The attempt's functions are not fully helpful as-is (see below); no object-extraction functions were used or proposed, but one might be needed to identify "blobs" (connected non-4 groups) for whole-object mirroring to avoid partial breaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly identifies the quadrant structure (13x13 top-left source, 27 total size) and basic mirror types (horizontal, vertical, 180), and preserves the central row of 1's untouched, which works in all outputs.
 * The copy-to-out and sequential application (horizontal -> vertical -> 180) is a good start, avoiding direct mutation of input.
 * Conflict detection via any() over the quadrant is a reasonable idea for deciding shifts, but it fails because the shift (0 or 1) is applied globally per mirror, causing entire rows to be skipped or offset (e.g., in train 1, bottom-left vertical mirror shifts incorrectly, leading to missing 3's and 2's in rows 18-20).
 * Train 1 generated: Top three rows match expected (all 4's with central 1); rows 3-7 partially match (8's and 2-3 patterns in top-left and mirrors) but bottom-left has extra 8's in row 3 col 20-21 (expected empty), row 18 has only two 2's instead of three, row 19 has 2-2-2 but shifted left without leading 4's/3's, row 20 has single 2 in col 3 (expected 2-3 pattern), row 21 has 8 in col 3 (expected none), and bottom-right has mismatched 8's in rows 22-24 (expected three 8's horizontally). These differences suggest over-propagation or wrong vertical/180 application, unknown why shift triggers incorrectly.
 * Train 2 generated: Top section (rows 0-7) matches expected closely (3's, 8's, 9-2-1 patterns mirrored), central row intact, but bottom half mismatches: row 19 has 2's but expected empty there, row 20 has partial 2's without full extension, rows 21-22 duplicate top-left 9-2-1 but shifted/missing 1's, row 23 has 9-2-1 but expected 1-2-9 flipped, row 24 has 8-3 but incomplete (missing pairs), row 25 has 3's but expected 3-3 pair, row 26 empty but expected 3-3. Differences indicate 180 mirror copies top-left directly without full inversion, and vertical doesn't flip properly; shift logic likely causes partial skips.
 * No object extraction was attempted, but patterns suggest it's needed (e.g., treat 2-2 as a unit); without it, cell-by-cell mirroring breaks connected shapes.
 * The shift heuristic in all three functions is broken/not helpful: it detects any mismatch but responds by offsetting all rows/columns, which distorts positions (e.g., tr = n-1-r + shift skips valid placements); better to resolve per cell (overwrite if target is 4 or matches, else skip).
 * Global quad=13 and n=27 are correct, but range(quad) assumes 0-12 indices without center adjustment.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors patterns (e.g., top-left 3-3-8-8 in rows 2-3 cols 20-26 matches horizontal flip; bottom-left has 2-2-2-9-9-9-9 in row 19 cols 19-26, suggesting vertical flip of top-right; 1-1 pairs in rows 6-7 and 18-19 indicate attempted 180 for bottom-right) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Row 2 has 3-3-8-8 starting at col 20 (good for horizontal), but row 4 has 2-2-2-9x4 in bottom-left (expected vertical flip of row 1's empty? Wait, input not given, but assuming similar to trains, this overfills with unmirrored 9's); rows 5-6 have 9x4-2-2 in bottom-right but asymmetric (9's not paired as in trains); row 7 has 2-1-1 (partial, missing full flip); bottom rows 22-24 have 2-2-2-9x4 but row 23 repeats top-left without 180 inversion (expected rotated version with 1-1-2-2 or similar); empty areas like row 8-12 in bottom have scattered 1's not in expected symmetry. It mismatches because shift logic offsets 180 mirror (e.g., 1's appear in wrong quadrant edges), and no per-cell conflict resolution leads to incomplete blobs (e.g., 9's extend too far without matching source). Without expected test output, it's unclear exact target, but patterns don't consistently reflect wholes (e.g., 9-9-9-9 should be exact flip, not partial), indicating same flaws as trains—likely incorrect.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

The following is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** provided train example (Train input 1 ↔ output 1, Train input 2 ↔ output 2). These are limited to elements that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way, such as through position, color, pixel count, or structural overlap. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., empty quadrants, overall grid silhouette) are excluded. Inconsistent interactions (e.g., exact color transformations in lower half, which vary by example without a common pattern) are excluded. Unknown aspects (e.g., why y-positions shift slightly in one example during mirroring) are noted but not forced into explanations. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is provided.

- **Blue cross → Yellow backgrounds (structural division and holes)**:  
  The blue cross (bbox spanning [0,0,26,26], pixels=53, holes=0) consistently divides the canvas into 4 quadrants and creates a single hole (holes=1) in each yellow background object. This interaction is fixed and unchanged across all inputs/outputs; the cross does not move, resize, or alter pixel count, but its presence directly causes the hole property in yellows. Yellows adjust bbox to avoid cross overlap but inherit the hole from it.

- **Colored blocks (Maroon, Red, Green, Light Blue) → Yellow backgrounds (pixel count reduction via coverage)**:  
  When new colored blocks (non-yellow, non-blue-cross) are added within a quadrant's bounds in the output compared to input, the corresponding yellow background's pixel count decreases by exactly the total pixels of those new blocks (e.g., Train 1 upper right: yellow decreases by 8 when Maroon pixels=4 + Green pixels=4 are added; Train 2 lower left: yellow decreases by 36 when Light Blue pixels=8 + Blue pixels=16 + Maroon pixels=4 + Green pixels=8 are added). This coverage interaction is positional (block bbox must overlap the yellow's bbox) and consistent; existing blocks' coverage is already reflected in input yellow pixels, so only additions affect the change. Holes in yellow remain 1 except in one case (Train 2 lower left output: holes=0, unknown reason—possibly related to block density connecting the existing hole, but not consistent across examples).

- **Upper left quadrant colored blocks → Upper right quadrant colored blocks (mirroring by position and color)**:  
  Each colored block (Maroon, Red, Green, Light Blue) in the upper left quadrant (bbox x within ~0-12, y within ~0-12) consistently causes a new block of the **same color** to appear in the upper right quadrant (bbox x within ~14-26, y within ~0-12) at an approximately mirrored x-position across the vertical center (~x=13). Y-position is generally preserved but may shift slightly upward by 1 unit in some cases (consistent pattern in Train 1, exact in Train 2; unknown exact rule for shift). Size (bbox dimensions, pixels) and shape properties (e.g., rectangular, no holes) are preserved. If the mirrored position overlaps an existing block (same or different color), no new block is added (e.g., Train 2: left Red mirrors to existing right Red position, so it stays unchanged). This is a position-to-position and color-to-color interaction; no change to left blocks themselves. Examples: Train 1 Maroon [5,4,6,5] → new Maroon [20,3,21,4]; Train 2 Light Blue [4,5,4,6] → new Light Blue [22,5,22,6].

No other interactions (e.g., lower quadrant block transformations, hole count changes beyond the cross, color-specific effects like Red → Green) are consistent across **every** example, as they vary in color, position, or outcome without a repeatable pattern. For instance, lower half additions occur in both but use different colors (Green/Maroon in Train 1 vs. Light Blue/Blue/Maroon/Green in Train 2) with no shared transformation rule identifiable from positions or properties alone.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:42:24] Response:
**High level:** This is a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid where the central row (index 13) and central column (index 13) form a fixed cross of 1's, dividing the grid into four quadrants. The objective is to complete the pattern by reflecting non-empty cells (values like 2, 3, 8, 9 representing colored or shaped elements) from given positions across the horizontal (left-right), vertical (top-bottom), and 180-degree axes into empty cells (4's) in the symmetric positions, ensuring the final grid is fully symmetric without overwriting existing non-4 values or the central cross.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The central cross (row 13 all 1's, column 13 all 1's in every row) must remain unchanged and acts as a mirror axis; reflections should not modify it or propagate across it directly.
 * Reflections are one-way propagation from known non-4 cells to symmetric empty (4) cells only, but the code's bidirectional checks (filling both directions) can cause over-propagation, where mirrored values spread unexpectedly in subsequent passes.
 * Apply reflections in a specific sequence (horizontal, then vertical, then 180) and limit iterations (10 is excessive; 1-2 cycles may suffice to avoid feedback loops that fill unintended areas).
 * Patterns appear to originate in one or more quadrants (often top-left or partial), and the goal is quadrant mirroring: e.g., top-left mirrors to top-right (horizontal), bottom-left (vertical), and bottom-right (180).
 * Empty cells (4's) are fillers; non-4 values represent distinct "objects" or colors that must be exactly mirrored in shape, size, and position without blending or altering (e.g., a 2x2 block of 8's mirrors as 2x2, not stretched).
 * Subtle: The loops must exclude the center (r==13 for horizontal/180, c==13 for vertical) to avoid tampering with the cross, but the half-range (range(13)) ensures only one side sources to the other without double-processing.
 * Order of operations matters: Horizontal first may mirror left-right, but if input has asymmetric placements, vertical/180 can then mirror those incorrectly if not isolated per axis.
 * No overwriting: If a target cell is already non-4, do not change it, even if source differs—this preserves input patterns in multiple quadrants.
 * Grid size (27x27, odd) means center is a single line; symmetries are point-symmetric around (13,13).
 * Potential for diagonal-like effects via 180, but only for opposite quadrants; not full rotational symmetry.
 * In examples, inputs likely have partial patterns (e.g., blobs of same numbers forming shapes), and outputs complete all quadrants identically reflected.
 * Watch for edge cases: isolated cells, lines touching the center (but not crossing), or patterns spanning half the grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions attempt axis-based propagation but are flawed due to bidirectional filling and excessive iterations. No custom types are defined. The deepcopy for grid copying is useful to avoid mutating inputs. No object extraction functions are present, but one could be added to identify "blobs" (connected non-4 regions) for verification:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)
```

```python
def identify_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (value, row_start, col_start) for connected regions; helpful for debugging symmetries
    blobs = []
    visited = [[False] * 27 for _ in range(27)]
    for r in range(27):
        for c in range(27):
            if g[r][c] != 4 and not visited[r][c] and r != 13 and c != 13:  # Skip center cross
                val = g[r][c]
                # Simple flood-fill to find blob bounds (stub; expand for full connected component)
                min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = r, r, c, c
                # ... (implement DFS/BFS to expand bounds while same val and unvisited)
                blobs.append((val, min_r, min_c))  # Example: track start for mirroring checks
                # Mark visited in expansion
    return blobs
```

The reflect functions are partially helpful as a framework for propagation but broken in practice (see below); use as base but fix to one-way (e.g., only fill from "source" half to "target" half, assuming input is in source quadrants).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses axis reflections to propagate non-4 values into 4's symmetrically, which correctly identifies the core mechanic of mirroring across the central cross and handles grid copying/deepcopy well.
 * What worked: Basic propagation logic fills some symmetric positions accurately (e.g., in train1, 8's in row 4 columns 5-6 and 20-21 match expected; central 1's preserved; skips center correctly).
 * What didn't work: Bidirectional filling (checking both directions per pair) combined with 10 iterations causes over-propagation and feedback, leading to extra or misplaced values (e.g., in train1 row 6, generated places 2 at col 3 and 23, but expected has 4's there—likely from 180 reflecting prematurely; in row 20, generated has 2,2,2,3 pattern mismatched vs expected 2,3 then 3,3,3,2,2,2).
 * In train1, generated row 5 has 2,2 at 20-21 but expected has none (should be 3,3,2,2 starting col 18); row 18-19 generated all 4's but expected has 2,2,2 at col 20-22 in row 19.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly fills row 4 with 2,8,3,2 symmetric but expected has 8,3 on one side only initially; row 20 generated has 2,2,2,2 but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1; lower rows like 23-24 have extra 2's and misplaced 1's vs expected 9's and 3's.
 * 180 reflection over-applies, creating diagonal symmetries that aren't intended (e.g., train2 row 21 generated 2,2,2,2,1 but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1).
 * No object extraction; patterns are treated as individual cells, missing that non-4 groups (e.g., 2x2 blocks) must mirror as wholes.
 * Function `reflect_horizontal` is helpful for left-right but broken by skipping wrong axis (skips rows instead of columns? No, code skips r==13 but mirrors columns—naming confusing, but logic is left-right; still, bidirectional causes issues).
 * `reflect_vertical` similar: top-bottom logic sound but overfills in multi-iterations.
 * `reflect_180` essential for opposite quadrant but exacerbates mismatches by combining axes too early.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core reflection principle but fails on iteration control and directionality; trains both INCORRECT due to ~20-30% cell mismatches per example (exact count unknown but visible in blobs like extra 2's/3's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-propagates similarly to training examples, creating full symmetries that likely exceed the intended partial mirroring (e.g., row 3 has 8,8 at cols 3-4 and 22-23, but if input pattern is only in one quadrant like top-left, this bilateral fill ignores source-only propagation; row 5-6 has full 9,9,9,9 blocks symmetric top-bottom and left-right, but expected might have them only reflected to bottom-right via 180 without extras).
 * Row 7 has 1,1 at cols 5-6 and 20-21, but 1's should only be in center cross— this is a critical error, as non-center 1's overwrite empties incorrectly (likely from mispropagating center or blob error).
 * Row 19 has 1,1 symmetric, again invalid (1's only center); row 20 all 4's except center but expected likely mirrors upper patterns like 2's downward.
 * Bottom rows (23-24) mirror upper 8's/3's correctly in placement but may overfill if input lacks bottom sources.
 * Overall, test output looks overly symmetric and pollutes with non-center 1's, suggesting the program doesn't distinguish input quadrants properly—does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it violates fixed cross rule and creates artifacts not seen in expected trains.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in **every** train puzzle (both train 1 and train 2). I focused solely on common patterns without inferring or forcing unsolved transformations, high-level rules, or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., no inclusion of Light Blue interactions, as it appears only in train 2; no speculation on why y-positions shift in train 1 but not train 2). If a potential connection (e.g., exact transformations) cannot be explained consistently without solving, it is noted as unknown. Irrelevant static elements (e.g., fixed blue lines with no change or effect) are excluded.

1. **Colored block positions (bbox) and sizes (pixels) → Yellow background pixel counts (within same quadrant)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Non-yellow colored blocks (Red, Green, Maroon, Blue) located within a specific yellow quadrant's bbox directly reduce that yellow component's pixel count by exactly the block's pixel count. This holds for all quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) in both inputs and outputs of both trains.  
   - Example evidence: Quadrant area consistently totals ~169 pixels (13x13 grid units); yellow pixels + sum of contained block pixels = 169 in every case (e.g., train 1 top-right input: yellow 165 + Red 4 = 169; output: yellow 157 + Red 4 + Maroon 4 + Green 4 = 169). No exceptions or irregularities.  
   - Effect: Block placement "subtracts" from yellow area, indicating spatial overlap or occlusion within the quadrant. Yellow bbox and holes=1 remain fixed unless altered (see below), but pixel count always reflects this containment interaction.

2. **Top-left quadrant blocks (color, bbox x-position, pixels) → Top-right quadrant blocks (added instances)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Blocks in the top-left yellow quadrant (colors: Red, Green, Maroon, Blue; their x-positions, y-positions, and pixels) consistently cause the addition of new blocks in the top-right yellow quadrant with matching color and pixels, where the new block's x-position is a horizontal reflection over the vertical center line (x' ≈ 26 - x, preserving width). Y-positions are similar but not exactly consistent (same in train 2, shifted up by 1 unit in train 1). Existing top-right blocks (if matching) remain unchanged.  
   - Example evidence: Train 1 adds Maroon (reflected x20-21 from input x5-6), Green (reflected x18-19 from input x7-8); train 2 adds Green (x20 from x6), Maroon (x21 from x5), Blue (x18-19 from x7-8)—all matching color/pixels, with x-reflection. No such additions occur without a top-left counterpart.  
   - Effect: Top-left blocks "influence" top-right by replication via x-mirroring; y-adjustment is unknown (not consistent across trains). This does not affect bottom quadrants.

3. **Yellow holes property → Potential change from block placements (bottom-left quadrant only)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Yellow holes=1 in all input quadrants across both trains, but in outputs, bottom-left yellow holes changes to 0 (train 2) when multiple adjacent blocks are added within it (totaling >30 pixels). No other quadrants show this change consistently.  
   - Example evidence: Train 1 bottom-left output remains holes=1 (minimal additions: 2 pixels); train 2 bottom-left output holes=0 (additions: 52 pixels, including adjacent chains). Top quadrants and other bottoms stay holes=1.  
   - Effect: Dense/adjacent block placements within bottom-left may close the hole (altering connectivity), but the exact trigger is unknown (occurs only in one train output, but pattern ties to block density).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., bottom quadrant block additions show adjacency to existing blocks in both trains, but colors/sizes/transforms vary inconsistently—Green/Maroon in train 1, plus Blue/Light Blue in train 2; exact rules unknown. No consistent vertical mirroring or color-specific effects across all examples. Pixel counts for blocks themselves do not change unless duplicated, but duplication logic is unknown). Elements like the blue lines (fixed bbox/pixels) show no interactions.

[2025-10-02 04:45:06] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 28-row by 27-column grid partially filled with colors (integers 1-9 representing shapes or blobs) and 4's as empty/background spaces, featuring a fixed central column (index 13) and central row (index 13) filled with 1's forming a cross; the goal is to complete the grid by applying a symmetry-based rule across the central vertical axis to form coherent patterns or objects, likely mirroring or propagating colors for individual shapes while preserving some asymmetries or shifts in the final output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid symmetry is left-right around column 13 (pairs like column 0 with 26, 1 with 25, ..., 12 with 14), but the expected outputs are not fully symmetric overall—patterns appear mirrored within specific "objects" or blobs of the same color, but these blobs can be shifted vertically (e.g., by 1 row) between left and right sides, and some areas remain one-sided without a mirror.
 * Empty cells (4's) are filled only where they complete a symmetric object, but not blindly; if both symmetric positions are 4 in the input, the program must infer the color from context (e.g., adjacent rows or connected components), as the current attempt fails to do this and leaves them empty when expected has a color.
 * Conflicts occur when symmetric positions both have non-4 colors: the attempt leaves them unchanged, but expected resolves to a specific pattern (e.g., preferring a connected blob's color or reversing order for mirror effect), suggesting object-based completion rather than global overwrite.
 * Patterns involve connected same-color blobs (e.g., 8's forming a shape across 2-4 rows/columns, 2's and 3's forming reversed-mirror shapes like 2-2-3-3 on left matching 3-3-2-2 on right but shifted down by 1 row); subtle shifts and reversals are key, and blobs do not always straddle the center equally.
 * The central cross of 1's is invariant and not to be modified; colors do not propagate into or across the center unless part of a blob.
 * No horizontal symmetry is evident, but vertical shifts suggest possible interaction with the central row; objects seem "drawn" partially on left or right, requiring completion to a symmetric form without overfilling unrelated areas.
 * Easy to miss: Expected outputs have isolated or partial blobs on one side (e.g., 3's appearing only on right without left mirror in some rows), indicating the rule completes only intended objects, not the entire grid; over-mirroring creates extras not in expected.
 * Input likely has sparse hints (some 4's on both sides of pairs), so the program must detect blobs (connected same-color groups, perhaps 4-connected or 8-connected) and extend them symmetrically if incomplete.
 * Row 13 (all 1's) and column 13 (all 1's) act as barriers or fixed elements; colors do not cross them.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided `make_grid_copy` using `deepcopy` is helpful for non-destructive processing. The `apply_left_right_symmetry` captures the core idea of pairing positions and filling 4's but is incomplete (see unhelpful below); it could be extended to detect blobs first.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)

# Potential helpful extension: Extract connected components (blobs) of same color, ignoring 4's and 1's in center.
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    """
    Finds connected components (4-connected) of a given color, excluding center cross.
    Returns list of lists of (row, col) positions for each blob.
    """
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and not (j == 13 or i == 13):
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and not (ny == 13 or nx == 13):
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly copies non-4 colors to symmetric 4 positions in cases where only one side has the color (e.g., in training 1 row 4, 8's are filled on right to match left, appearing in generated as 8's on both sides at positions 5-6 left and 20-21 right, which aligns with expected).
 * It fails to fill positions where both symmetric spots are 4 in input but expected requires a color, indicating no inference of missing blob parts (e.g., in training 1 row 3, generated has all 4's on sides, but expected has 8's at right 20-21; likely input had 4's there, but context from adjacent rows demands filling).
 * In conflict cases (both sides non-4 but different), it preserves the input without resolution, leading to mismatches (e.g., training 1 row 5: generated keeps left 8's at 5-6 and right 2's at 20-21, but expected has left 8's at 5-6 and right 3's at 18-19 + 2's at 20-21, so missed filling 18-19 with 3's and didn't reverse/resolve the 8 vs. 2 conflict).
 * For training 1 row 6-7, generated correctly mirrors the 2's and 3's where possible (left 5-8 = 2,2,3,3 to right 18-21 = 3,3,2,2, matching the reversed pattern in expected), showing partial success for connected blobs without conflict.
 * In training 2 row 4-5, it mirrors 3's and 8's correctly in some pairs (e.g., position 6 left 3 to 20 right 3), but fails lower down (e.g., row 20 generated has symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but expected has extended 9's, 2's, and 1's only on left at 2-11, with partial on right in row 21-22, indicating over-mirroring unrelated areas).
 * Training 1 mismatches include missing one-sided fills (e.g., row 18-19 right 3,3,3,2,2,2 at 16-21 in expected, but generated likely left some as 4 if no left mirror); row 20 left adds 2 at 3 and 3 at 4 in expected without right mirror. Unknown why generated row 5 right has only 2's at 20-21 but misses 3's at 18-19—possibly input had 3's but code didn't propagate due to non-empty adjacent or range limit.
 * Training 2 mismatches: generated row 20-23 overfills symmetric 2's, but expected has asymmetric extension (e.g., row 20 left 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1 but right all 4's; row 21 right partial 1,1,2,2,9); row 23-24 generated symmetric 3's/8's, but expected has them only on right or shifted.
 * The `apply_left_right_symmetry` function is partially helpful for pairing and filling empties but broken for conflicts and inference—it collects non-4's before modifying but doesn't overwrite non-4's or detect blobs for extension, leading to incomplete outputs; do not use as-is in future, but adapt for blob detection.
 * No other functions in the attempt; `deepcopy` is reliable but basic.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it attempts full left-right mirroring by filling 4's (e.g., row 3 left 3-6=8,8,3,3 mirrored to right 20-23=3,3,8,8; row 4 adds 2's at right 18-20 and 8's at 21-22), creating a mostly symmetric grid, but expected likely follows the same partial, shifted, object-based completion as training (e.g., blobs like 9's in row 5-6 left 1-4=9's mirrored but reversed/shifted on right, with 2's at 5-7 both sides but not overfilled; 1's in row 7-8 at 5-6 both sides). 
 * It overfills symmetries where expected may leave one-sided (e.g., row 20-23 generated symmetric 2's at 4-7 left and 20-23 right, but test input patterns suggest asymmetric extensions like training 2 row 20); misses potential inferences for empty pairs (e.g., if input has partial 3's or 8's blobs, generated fills only existing mirrors, but expected would complete shifted blobs).
 * The output makes some sense for simple symmetry (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 at 1-4 left to 22-25 right, 2's connected), but looks too uniform/symmetric compared to training expecteds' partial/shifted blobs, suggesting it doesn't handle vertical shifts or object boundaries correctly—likely incorrect as it would fail similar to training cases with missing fills (e.g., if test has empty symmetric pairs needing context fill, they stay 4).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 matrix (with row 13 and column 13 acting as a central divider or cross that is skipped in most operations), where blank cells (4's) are filled based on symmetry, pattern extension, and propagation rules involving specific numbers (e.g., runs of 2's extend to 3's, uniform 2 blocks pair with 9's and 1's, 2 blobs extend to 8's vertically). The goal is to apply a sequence of transformations to complete the grid logically, matching expected patterns in training examples, likely simulating a logic puzzle like a fill-a-pix or region-growing challenge with mirroring across the center.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross (row 13 and column 13) that must be skipped in all operations—no filling or propagation into/out of these positions, and blobs or runs cannot cross them.
 * Mirroring is left-to-right (or symmetric across column 13), but only applies to non-continuation sequences of length >=2 on the left side (columns 0-12), filling 4's on the right (columns 14-26) with reversed sequences if at least one matching non-4 exists on the right to "seed" it; continuations (identical left runs in consecutive rows) are skipped to avoid over-mirroring vertical patterns.
 * Runs of 2's on the left (columns 0-12) can extend rightward into adjacent 4's with 3's (suffix after the run), but only if the extension fits within columns 0-12 without overlapping non-4's.
 * On the right (columns 14-26), runs of 2's can extend leftward (prefix) into 4's with 3's, but only if the prefix fits and is all 4's.
 * Uniform even-length (>=2) runs of 2's on the left extend leftward into 4's with 9's (half the length) and rightward into 4's with 1's (half the length), but only if spaces are all 4's and within bounds (0-12); similar but mirrored logic for right-side 2 runs (1's prefix, 9's suffix), though the suffix logic in the code has bounds issues (e.g., min(nines_start + num9, 27) risks overflow).
 * Vertical propagation fills 4's above (upward) or below (downward) based on non-4 neighbors, but skips the center row/column and only propagates if the source is non-4.
 * Blobs of 2's are extracted as connected components (4-directional adjacency), excluding singles unless it's a single 2; only rectangular blobs (full height x width fill) are extended vertically with 8's—upward for upper-half blobs (min_r <13), downward for lower-half (max_r >13), but only if the extension space (another full rectangle of same size) is all 4's or existing 8's; average column position determines left/right but isn't used in extension.
 * Subtleties: Order of operations matters (e.g., mirroring before completions, propagation after); avoid filling if it would overlap non-4's or cross center; include single 2's as blobs for potential extension but not others; right-side completions have buggy index calculations (e.g., ones_start = run_start - k assumes prefix length k, but code sets to 1's incorrectly in some cases); vertical extension skips if partial (e.g., ext_end_r >26); propagation is bidirectional but applied in passes (up then down).
 * General: All changes must be conservative—only fill 4's, never overwrite non-4's; patterns suggest thematic consistency (e.g., 2's as "cores" extending to borders like 3/8/9/1); test for rectangularity strictly (len(positions) == height * width).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)
```
(Utility for safe modifications; essential to avoid mutating input.)

```python
def get_left_run(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> Tuple[int, List[int]]:
    seq = []
    c = 0
    while c < 13 and grid[r][c] != 4:
        seq.append(grid[r][c])
        c += 1
    return c - len(seq), seq  # Returns start column and sequence
```
(Helpful for identifying left-side runs for mirroring/continuations; core to symmetry detection, but assumes runs start at c=0—may need generalization for mid-row runs.)

```python
def is_continuation(grid: List[List[int]], r: int) -> bool:
    if r == 0:
        return False
    prev_start, prev_seq = get_left_run(grid, r - 1)
    curr_start, curr_seq = get_left_run(grid, r)
    return prev_start == curr_start and prev_seq == curr_seq
```
(Useful for skipping vertical repeats in mirroring; prevents over-filling stacked patterns.)

```python
def propagate_vertical(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    g = make_grid_copy(grid)
    # Up propagation (fill above from below)
    for r in range(1, 27):
        for c in range(27):
            if r == 13 or c == 13:
                continue
            if g[r - 1][c] == 4 and g[r][c] != 4:
                g[r - 1][c] = g[r][c]
    # Down propagation (fill below from above)
    for r in range(26):
        for c in range(27):
            if r == 13 or c == 13:
                continue
            if g[r][c] != 4 and g[r + 1][c] == 4:
                g[r + 1][c] = g[r][c]
    return g
```
(Helpful for vertical filling; bidirectional and skips center correctly, but may need multiple iterations if chains are long; works well for simple cases but could propagate too early if order is wrong.)

```python
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    rows, cols = 27, 27
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j] and i != 13 and j != 13:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and nx != 13 and ny != 13:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(blob) > 1 or (len(blob) == 1 and color == 2):  # include singles for 2
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```
(Essential for identifying connected 2's as blobs; DFS-based, excludes center, includes single 2's—key for extension rules; could be extended for other colors.)

The following functions are broken or not helpful:
- `mirror_left_to_right`: Buggy—has_match check requires a matching non-4 on right, but fills only 4's with reversed seq; skips too aggressively and doesn't handle mid-row starts; leads to under-filling (e.g., no mirroring in train1 row5-12).
- `complete_2_runs_with_3`: Left-side suffix logic overlaps run (c += k -1 buggy); right-side prefix assumes prefix_start = run_start - k, which may not match run length; overfills or skips valid extensions.
- `complete_uniform_2_with_9_1_left`: Assumes even k for uniform 2's, extends prefix with 9's (k//2) and suffix with 1's (k), but suffix end = s_start + k risks exceeding 13; only left-side, ignores non-uniform.
- `complete_2_run_right_with_1_9`: Similar bugs—ones_start = run_start - k (should be half?), nines_start = run_start + k, and bounds check is incomplete (min(...,27) but 27 is out); fills 1's in prefix but code sets to 1's incorrectly for length k instead of half.
- `extend_2_with_8`: Only extends if fully rectangular and space is 4's/8's, but upper extension checks g[er][ec] !=4 and !=8 (should be ==4 or ==8?); lower extension sets to 8 unconditionally if can_extend; avg_c <13.5 unused; doesn't handle partial or non-rect blobs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided, but it fails both training examples completely (INCORRECT), indicating partial understanding of rules but poor implementation.
 * Worked: Vertical propagation correctly fills some chains (e.g., 1's in column 13? Wait, column 13 skipped, but row13 is all 1's untouched); blob extraction identifies 2's for extension; some 3's from 2-runs are placed (e.g., train1 rows 5-12 columns 7-8).
 * Didn't work: Mirroring underperforms—no fills in many expected symmetric spots (e.g., train1 row6 columns 18-19 should be 3,3 but empty); 8's misplaced or missing (train1 generated has 8's in row3 col5-6 and row4 col5-6, but expected has them in row4 col21-22, row5 col21-22, row21 col3, row22 col20-22); extra/unexpected 9's and 1's (train1 row5 col18-19=1,1 but expected empty until later); 3's overextended (train1 row17 col16-18=3,3,3 but expected starts later); right-side 2-run completions buggy, leading to no 9's in train1 row5 col22.
 * Train1 mismatches: Generated fills 8's too early/left (rows3-4 col5-6) vs expected right/lower (rows4-5 col21-22, row21 col3, rows22-24 col20-22); misses 2's in row6 col5-6 and 3's in row6 col7-8; extra 1's in row4 col18-19; lower half 3's/2's shifted wrong (row20 col3=2 but expected row20 empty there).
 * Train2 mismatches: Generated has extra 3's in row2 col6 and row4 col6 (expected empty); 8's in row4 col5-6 but expected row4 col5 empty, row5 col21=3,8; fills 1's in row5 col7-8 but expected there; lower half overfills 9's/2's/1's in rows19-26 col2-13 (e.g., row19 col2-3=9,9 but expected row19 empty col2-3); misses 8's in row23 col4-5 and 3's in row24-25 col6-7.
 * Function `complete_2_run_right_with_1_9` is broken (index errors, wrong lengths—e.g., fills full k 1's instead of half); `extend_2_with_8` is partially helpful but buggy (wrong can_extend logic, unused is_left); overall program order (mirror -> left9/1 -> right1/9 -> 3's -> prop -> extend) causes early fills to block later ones.
 * extract_blobs is essential for 2-extension but underused (only for 8's, misses non-rect or multi-color blobs).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it overfills the grid with patterns that don't align with training expectations, suggesting rule misapplications (e.g., heavy 9's in rows5-12 col1-4 look like overextended left 2-runs, but training shows more sparse 9's; 8's in rows2-3 col3-4 and row4 col3-4 seem prematurely extended upward without full rectangles; lower half has 1's in row18 col14-17 and 2's/9's in rows19-26 col20-27, but training lower patterns are more contained like row20 col3=2,3 without broad 1's prefix). It appears to propagate too aggressively (e.g., 3's in rows3-12 col16-18 match train but extend to row2 incorrectly); misses potential mirroring (e.g., if input has left 3's, right should symmetric but seems asymmetric). Without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify fully, but it doesn't make sense as a logical completion—too many dense fills (e.g., rows5-12 almost full col0-9 with 9/2/1) vs training's sparser, symmetric results; likely needs better bounds checking and continuation skips to handle test's unique patterns (e.g., longer vertical 2's?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (indices 0-26), where non-empty cells (values other than 4, which seems to represent blanks or empty space) in certain regions are propagated via reflections across the vertical midline, horizontal midline, and main diagonal to fill in corresponding blank cells in symmetric positions, resulting in a fully symmetric completed grid. The goal is to apply these reflections correctly in the right order or iterations to match the expected symmetric patterns in training examples, which include colored shapes (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 8s, 9s) that mirror across quadrants while preserving a central row of 1s.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 27x27, with row 13 (0-indexed) fixed as all 1s, acting as a central divider or axis that should not be altered.
 * Reflections are across three axes: vertical (columns symmetric around c=13), horizontal (rows symmetric around r=13), and diagonal (both r and c symmetric around 13), but the current implementation only partially fills blanks (4s) without ensuring full propagation or handling overlaps/multiple reflections per cell.
 * Only copy non-4 values to 4 positions; do not overwrite existing non-4 values, but the order of reflections matters—e.g., upper-right first may not propagate fully if later reflections depend on prior fills.
 * Subtlety: Reflections seem to be one-way (from source to target if target is 4), but may need to be bidirectional or repeated in loops until no changes occur, as partial fills in one step can enable further propagation.
 * Patterns represent shapes (e.g., blobs of 2s, 3s) that must mirror exactly, including size and position; mismatches occur when shapes are incomplete (e.g., missing extensions like three 2s instead of two, or incorrect positioning across the center).
 * The central row (all 1s) and column interactions: values near the center may need special handling to avoid overwriting the 1s row.
 * Grid has quadrants divided by the center lines; upper-left influences lower-right via diagonal, but current code doesn't fully symmetrize all pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs extend shapes horizontally or vertically across more cells (e.g., three 3s and three 2s in row 19-20 of training 1), suggesting reflections must propagate chains of values, not just single cells.
 * No rotation or other transformations; strictly reflections, and 4s are placeholders to be filled, not propagated themselves.
 * Potential for overfilling: If a cell gets filled multiple times from different reflections, it should stabilize to the correct value, but current code doesn't iterate.

# Note: This flood-fill could help verify symmetry by checking if shapes mirror across axes, but it's not used in the current program.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used three one-way reflection functions (upper-right vertical, bottom-left horizontal, bottom-right diagonal), applied sequentially without iteration, which partially filled some symmetric positions but failed to propagate full shapes (e.g., in training 1, generated two 2s where expected three, and misplaced 8s/3s in lower rows).
 * Worked: Correctly identified the three symmetry axes and conditional filling (only to 4s from non-4s), and preserved the central row of 1s; some upper-left patterns were mirrored to upper-right and bottom-left correctly (e.g., 8s in rows 4-5).
 * Did not work: Incomplete propagation—e.g., in training 1, row 19 expected three 2s and three 3s extending rightward, but generated only two; row 20 had incorrect 2 at col 3 instead of expected 2 at col 3 but missing extensions; diagonal reflection didn't fully mirror shapes across center (e.g., 8s in row 21-22 expected three-wide but generated two).
 * In training 2, generated partial mirrors (e.g., 2s and 9s in rows 5-6 mirrored somewhat, but row 20 had extra 2s where expected 9s/1s chain; row 23 had 3s/8s misplaced); failed to extend shapes like four 2s into proper symmetric blocks with 1s and 9s.
 * Order of reflections caused issues: upper-right first filled verticals prematurely, but horizontal/diagonal didn't update based on those changes, leading to asymmetries (e.g., unknown reason for 1s appearing in wrong positions in row 5 col 20-21 of training 2 generated vs. expected).
 * No iteration: Single pass per reflection means chained fills (e.g., a fill enabling another reflection) are missed.
 * Loops only over range(13) instead of 27, limiting to half-grid and missing bidirectional or full coverage.
 * Function reflect_upper_right is helpful for vertical symmetry but incomplete (one-way, half-range); similar for others—keep but extend to bidirectional and full range.
 * No shape extraction used, which might help debug by verifying mirrored blobs, but not essential yet.
 * Central row handling is correct (not overwritten), but interactions near row/col 13 are subtle and sometimes lead to partial fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially symmetrizes but does not look fully correct, as it shows incomplete shape extensions similar to training failures—e.g., row 4 has two 8s and two 3s mirrored to row 23, but expected likely needs three-wide for 2s/3s based on training patterns (row 4 generated: 8,8,3,3 but test input suggests larger blobs); row 5 has two 2s where patterns imply more.
 * In rows 5-6, 9s and 2s are mirrored vertically and diagonally, but only two 2s each instead of potentially three or four to match shape completeness seen in expected trainings; 1s in rows 7-8 and 19-20 appear symmetric but isolated, possibly missing connections to central patterns.
 * Lower half (rows 19-24) has partial mirrors (e.g., row 21 two 2s, row 23 two 8s/3s), but asymmetries like row 4's 8s/3s not fully propagating to row 23's expected extended form; overall, it looks like 70% symmetric but misses chain propagations, making it incorrect without expected to confirm, but inconsistent with training expectations for full shape mirroring.
 * The output preserves the central 1s row correctly, which is good, but fails to handle larger blobs (e.g., four 9s in row 6 not fully mirrored horizontally in lower rows).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a 27x27 grid divided by central lines at row 13 and column 13, where patterns (sequences or "blobs" of numbers representing colors like 1,2,3,8,9) on the left side (columns 0-12) are mirrored, extended, or transformed to the right side (columns 14-26) and sometimes downward, following rules for symmetry, continuations from above rows, prefixing runs of 2's with 3's, and adding blocks of 8's below certain 2-blobs, while leaving 4's as empty cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed dividers: all of row 13 and column 13 are filled with 1's, and patterns do not cross these lines (e.g., blobs skip column 13 and row 13 in extraction).
 * Mirroring from left to right applies to sequences of non-4 cells in a row, but only if they are not exact continuations of the same sequence from the row above (to avoid over-mirroring vertical stacks); reversed sequences are placed starting from the symmetric position on the right (e.g., for a sequence ending at column j on left, mirror starts at 26 - (j- something)).
 * For runs of 2's on the right side (columns 14+), if length >=2, prefix them with an equal-length run of 3's immediately to the left (in columns 13+), but only fill 4's without conflicts.
 * Below blobs of 2's (connected components, ignoring dividers), add vertical extensions of 8's in the rows immediately below the blob's bottom row, matching the blob's horizontal width, but only in empty (4) cells; also handle partial fills like a single 8 at specific positions (e.g., column 3 in the first extension row).
 * Complete partial extensions: if a 2 on the left (columns 0-12) is followed by a 4 to its right, fill that 4 with 3 (suggesting a "partial left two" rule for incomplete mirrors).
 * Subtlety: For uniform-color sequences (all same number) of length >=2 (except color 1), if not a continuation, extend upward into the previous row's mirror area if empty.
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same color, excluding divider cells; only blobs with size >1 are considered for extensions.
 * Conflicts in mirroring: if a mirror position already has a non-4 that doesn't match the expected reversed value, skip filling; partial matches (some cells already correct) may still allow filling the rest.
 * Order of operations matters: mirroring first, then completing 2-runs with 3-prefixes, then adding 8-blocks below 2-blobs, then partial left completions.
 * Easy to miss: Right-side patterns can influence left-side fills (e.g., 3-prefixes extend leftward into column 14- but wait, code has i=14, filling left to c=i-1-p >=14? Wait, seems buggy); also, 9's and other colors like 1's may have special non-mirroring behavior.
 * Vertical influences: Check for continuations only upward (r-1), not downward; 8-extensions are strictly below and don't mirror.
 * Grid is 27 rows x 27 cols, but patterns are sparse; row 13 is all 1's, column 13 all 1's in output.

                if len(blob) > 1:
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented mirroring of left sequences to right (reversed), but skipped fills too aggressively on continuations and conflicts, leading to incomplete right-side patterns in both training examples.
 * Worked: Basic mirroring for non-continuation sequences (e.g., in training 1, correctly placed some 8's below and 2's/3's on right); extracted 2-blobs correctly for 8-extensions in some positions (e.g., rows 20-22 in training 1 match expected 8's).
 * Didn't work: In training 1, row 5 (0-indexed) generated [3,3,2,2] starting at col 19 but expected starts at col 18 with [3,3,2,2]; also added extra 2 at row 20 col 23 which expected lacks; row 6 has correct but overall mismatches in 3-prefix positioning.
 * In training 1, failed to prefix 2-runs with 3's correctly in rows 18-19 (generated correct, but row 20 has misplaced 2/3); also added 8 at row 3 col 20-21 which expected has, but extra 8's elsewhere.
 * In training 2, mirroring introduced incorrect 3's and 8's in left side (e.g., row 3 col 6=3 but expected 4? Wait, expected has 3 at row 3 col 20); over-extended 8-blocks to width 4 in rows 23-26 but expected varies (e.g., row 23 has 8's at col 19-22, but generated has at 19-22 correctly? Wait, mismatches in row 20-22 with extra 2's and 3's on left).
 * In training 2, complete_two_runs_with_three_prefix filled 3's leftward from right 2's but started at i=14 and filled to c>=14, which is buggy (should fill into left? But code fills left from i, yet i=14 is right side); led to no fills in some prefix spots.
 * add_eight_block_below_two_blob worked partially (added 8's below 2-blobs in right side), but over-added vertically (e.g., in training 2, extended to row 26 but expected stops earlier) and added partial 8 at col 3 incorrectly or missed.
 * complete_partial_left_two only checked cols 0-12 for 2 followed by 4, filling with 3, but missed cases where partials are deeper or on right.
 * extract_blobs is helpful and correct for finding connected 2-groups, but only used for color=2; could extend to other colors.
 * mirror_left_to_right has logic for uniform color upward extension, but condition "all(x == sequence[0] for x in sequence) and sequence[0] != 1" skipped color=1 correctly but over-applied for 2's in some vertical stacks.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of mirroring and blob extensions but bugs in prefixing (wrong starting columns, conflicts), over-filling 8's, and missing subtle position shifts (e.g., 3-prefixes start one column left of 2-run).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors left patterns to right (e.g., row 3: left 8,8,3,3 -> right 3,3,8,8 correctly reversed; row 5-6: 9's and 2's mirrored with length 4 each), adds 8's below 2-blobs in rows 23-26 cols 19-22, and prefixes some 3's before 2's in rows 20-22 cols 14-19.
 * Does not look fully correct: In row 4, right side has 2,2,2 at cols 19-21 but no 3-prefix before them (expected likely 3's at cols 16-18 or similar based on training patterns); row 7-8 have 1,1 on right but left has 1,1 at cols 5-6, suggesting incomplete mirroring or continuation skip error.
 * Row 20-22: 3's and 2's prefixed correctly on right, but row 22 has 2,3 on left cols 5-6 which seems like a partial fill error (complete_partial_left_two may have over-applied); expected likely no left changes there.
 * 8-block in rows 23-26 cols 19-22 looks correct for below 2's in row 19? But test input not shown, assuming based on patterns—partial 8 at row 23 col 4? Code has no such fill, but earlier partial rule mentions col 3.
 * Missing upward extensions for uniform sequences (e.g., 9's in row 5-6 might need upward if applicable); overall, test output has more fills than expected in left partials and incomplete prefixes, suggesting same prefix bug as training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid (with row 13 and column 13 as dividers or barriers) where blank cells (4s) are filled based on pattern completion rules involving symmetry (mirroring left-to-right across the center), sequence extensions (e.g., completing 2s with 3s as prefixes/suffixes), blob extensions (adding 8s to rectangular groups of 2s), and special fillings for even-width rectangular 2-blobs (adding 9s and 1s). The goal is to apply these rules in a specific order to match the expected completed grid without overwriting existing non-4 cells unless specified.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central cross (row 13 and column 13) that must be skipped or treated as barriers; no filling occurs there, and blobs cannot cross them.
 * Left side (columns 0-12) and right side (14-26) are handled semi-independently but with mirroring: sequences on left can be reversed and placed on right if they start after column 13, but only if not a direct vertical continuation from the row above, and only overwrite if the sequence contains 1,3, or 9.
 * Sequence extraction (get_sequence) finds contiguous non-4 runs starting from a column, but mirroring requires symmetric positioning (e.g., end_left mirrored to start_right = 26 - end_left) and skips if start_right < 14.
 * Completing 2s with 3s: On left, add 3-suffix after a run of 2s if space allows and blanks; on right, add 3-prefix before a run of 2s, but skip rows with any 9 on left. Length of 3-run matches 2-run length (k).
 * Blobs of 2s are only extended if rectangular (h * w == blob size), and 8s are added above (for upper blobs) or below (for lower blobs) in matching widths, but only on blanks; no diagonal or irregular shapes.
 * For even-width rectangular 2-blobs on left (w >=2, even, fully within 0-12), add w/2 9s to the left and w 1s to the right; symmetric on right but mirrored (9s outside right, 1s inside leftward).
 * Order matters: complete rectangular 2-blobs first, then left 3-suffixes, then mirror, then right 3-prefixes, then add 8s—running out of order can cause overwrites or misses.
 * Subtle: "Overwrite" in mirroring only if seq has 1/3/9, but still checks for 4 or overwrite condition; blobs exclude single cells (len(blob)>1); no filling if prefix/suffix would go outside bounds or overlap non-4s.
 * Vertical continuity check (is_continuation) prevents redundant mirroring if the exact sequence repeats from row above at same start column.
 * All operations preserve existing non-4 cells; 4s are blanks to fill.
 * Easy to miss: Rectangular check is strict (no holes or irregular); 8-extensions are vertical only (same columns); mirroring skips short sequences or those too close to center; right-side 3-prefix skips rows with left 9s to avoid conflicts.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (single program provided) partially understands mirroring and blob extraction but fails on sequence completion and ordering, leading to incorrect 3-placements and missed 8-extensions in both training examples.
 * For Training 1: Generated incorrectly places 9s and 2s in row 6 left (expected 2s further left without 9s there), adds extra 1s in row 5 right where expected 3s, misses 8 in row 3 right col 21-22 (generated 4s), places 3s in row 18-20 left starting too early (expected from col 14), and adds 8 in row 21 left col 3 where expected nothing; also row 6 right has 1,1,2,2,9 but expected 3,3,2,2,4. These differences suggest over-aggressive mirroring without proper continuation checks and wrong 3-prefix logic.
 * For Training 2: Generated places 3s in row 4 left col 6 (unexpected, expected nothing), adds 1s in row 5-6 left cols 7-8 where expected nothing, over-extends 8s in rows 23-26 right (expected 3s mixed in), places 1s in row 20 right where expected nothing, and misses 3s in row 23 right cols 20-21 (generated 8s); row 23 left has 8,8,3,3 but expected nothing there. Issues include faulty rectangular 2-blob detection (wrong widths for 9/1 filling) and 3-prefix overwriting existing patterns.
 * Function `mirror_left_to_right` is partially helpful but broken: it overwrites too eagerly (e.g., places reversed seq even on non-4s if condition met) and skips valid mirrors if start_right <14 incorrectly; needs tighter bounds and continuation logic.
 * Function `complete_right_two_with_three_prefix` is unhelpful/broken: skips rows with left 9s correctly but fills 3s in wrong positions (e.g., too far right or overwriting), and loop starts from c=26 but decrements without proper start detection.
 * Function `complete_left_two_with_three_suffix` has similar issues: fills 3s but increments c incorrectly after fill, leading to missed or extra suffixes.
 * Function `add_eight_blocks` is helpful for blob extension but limited: only vertical, rectangular, and direction based on blob position (upper adds above, lower below), but misses some (e.g., Train1 row3 right) due to prior wrong fillings; doesn't handle mixed upper/lower well.
 * Function `complete_rectangular_two_blobs` is mostly helpful for 9/1 additions but buggy on right side: mirrors incorrectly (adds 9s outward but 1s inward with wrong counts), and assumes even w but doesn't check vertical alignment strictly.
 * Overall, attempt shows core understanding of blobs and mirroring but fails on order (e.g., mirroring before all completions causes chain errors) and boundary conditions (e.g., col 12/14 edges); extract_blobs is essential and correct for identifying groups.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It overfills with 9s in rows 5-6 left (four 9s wide, but expected fewer or none based on patterns), places 1s in rows 7-8 left cols 5-6 unexpectedly (likely wrong mirroring of 2s), adds 3s in row 4 right cols 14-17 where a prefix for 2s in 19-21 might be intended but positioning seems off (expected possibly shifted), extends 8s in row 2 left cols 3-4 and row 20-23 right cols 18-21 but misses potential upper extensions above row 2; row 20-22 left has 1s and 2s with 9s that look like over-mirrored from right 2s without continuation check. These suggest the program applies rules but in wrong sequence, causing asymmetric fills (e.g., left 9s not mirrored properly to right 1s) and extra blobs; does not match expected symmetry or completion as rules would dictate cleaner 3-prefixes and rectangular 8s without extras.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual symmetry puzzle on a 27x27 grid divided into four quadrants (top-left 0-12 rows/cols, top-right 0-12 rows/13-26 cols, bottom-left 13-26 rows/0-12 cols, bottom-right 13-26 rows/13-26 cols), where the goal is to mirror shapes from the top-left quadrant into the other three quadrants using reflections across axes, with special handling for a "red" anchor shape (color 2) that may resize or position blocks relative to it, and flips for x/y axes depending on the target quadrant. The grid uses 4 as background, 1 as a central horizontal divider (row 13), and other colors (e.g., 2,3,8,9) for distinct shapes or blocks that must be copied, flipped, and potentially adjusted for attachments or overlaps without corrupting the background or divider.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Reflections must preserve shape integrity but apply flips: top-right flips horizontally (x-axis mirror), bottom-left and bottom-right flip vertically (y-axis mirror) and possibly adjust for "bottom" orientation, which may invert attachments (e.g., above becomes below).
 * Color 2 (red) is special: it acts as an anchor; if absent in target, copy and flip it from source; if present, use its bounding box to position/resize other blocks relative to attachments (left/right for horizontal, above/below for vertical), adjusting heights/widths based on original red size (e.g., h_new = max(1, h_t - h + orig_red_h) to fit around it).
 * Attachments are crucial: detect if source block touches red on left/right/above/below; if attached, place target block accordingly (e.g., left_attach places to the left of target red, flipping position for bottom quadrants); if not attached, default to full-grid flip (using 26 - coord for mirroring across center).
 * Avoid overlaps: the has_overlap function checks for non-background/non-divider/non-color cells in target area, but it's underused; filling must not overwrite 1 or 4, and shapes shouldn't bleed across quadrants or the divider.
 * Bounding boxes (bbox) must be precise: min/max r/c for each color block in source/target; empty bbox means skip or handle specially (e.g., no red in target triggers full copy/flip).
 * Subtle grid bounds: reflections use 0-12 source, but targets adjust (e.g., top-right cols 14-26); flips use 26 - max/min for centering; bottom quadrants treat row 13 as divider, so vertical placements may shift down (e.g., above_attach in bottom flips to below red).
 * Shapes are solid blocks (rectangular fills), not pixel-perfect; multiple same-color blocks aren't split—treat per color bbox.
 * Easy to miss: when red exists in target, non-attached blocks still flip relative to whole grid, not red; for bottom, horizontal attachments don't flip x, but vertical do y-invert; resize only for attached blocks to "fill gaps" around red; ignore 1 and 4 in color extraction.
 * Order matters: apply reflections sequentially (top-right first, then bottom-left, then bottom-right), as each modifies the grid cumulatively.
 * Potential bugs: fill function clamps to grid (0 to len-1), but may clip shapes; get_colors excludes 1/4 correctly, but doesn't handle multi-block same color; attachment detection uses overlap checks (y_overlap = max(minr, minr_s) <= min(maxr, maxr_s)), but fails if blocks touch edges without overlap.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional, Tuple

def get_colors(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> set:
    colors = set()
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[r][c] not in (1, 4):
                colors.add(g[r][c])
    return colors
```
(Extracts unique non-background/divider colors in a region; helpful for identifying shapes to reflect.)

```python
def get_bbox(g: List[List[int]], color: int, min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int) -> Optional[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    positions = [(r, c) for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1) for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1) if g[r][c] == color]
    if not positions:
        return None
    minr = min(r for r, _ in positions)
    maxr = max(r for r, _ in positions)
    minc = min(c for _, c in positions)
    maxc = max(c for _, c in positions)
    return minr, maxr, minc, maxc
```
(Computes tight bounding box for a color in a region; essential for positioning/reflecting individual shapes accurately.)

```python
def fill(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, color: int):
    for r in range(max(0, min_r), min(len(g) - 1, max_r) + 1):
        for c in range(max(0, min_c), min(len(g[0]) - 1, max_c) + 1):
            g[r][c] = color
```
(Fills a rectangular area with a color, clamping to grid bounds; useful for placing reflected shapes, but ensure no overwrite of 1/4.)

```python
def has_overlap(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, color: int) -> bool:
    for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if 0 <= r < len(g) and 0 <= c < len(g[0]) and g[r][c] not in (1, 4) and g[r][c] != color:
                return True
    return False
```
(Checks if target area has conflicting colors before filling; helpful for avoiding corruption, but underutilized in the main logic—could prevent bad placements.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shows partial understanding of quadrant reflections and flips (e.g., top-right horizontal flip works somewhat, as upper 8s and 2/3 placements are close in training 1), but fails on attachment/resizing logic for red (2), leading to mispositioned or oversized blocks in bottom quadrants.
 * In training 1: Generated places 8s correctly in top-right (rows 4-5, cols 20-21 matching expected), but upper 2/3 in rows 6-7 are correct; however, bottom-left has extra/wrong 8s in rows 15-17 cols 19-22 (expected empty there, has 8s instead of 4s), and row 20 has 2/3 extended to col 23-25 incorrectly (expected only to col 22); row 18-20 2/3 are shifted right vs. expected left-aligned under divider; upper row 3 has 8s in cols 20-21 but expected in row 4 only—timing of reflections overwrites partially.
 * In training 1: Bottom-right row 22 has single 8 in col 3 (generated) vs. expected none; row 20-21 2/3 in cols 19-25 generated vs. expected cols 18-22; unknown reason for 3s in row 21 col 22-25 (mismatch in flip/resize).
 * In training 2: Upper parts mostly match (e.g., 8/3 in rows 4-5 correct, 2/1/9 in rows 5-6 flipped horizontally ok), but bottom-left row 19 has 9/2 misplaced (generated cols 18-21 vs. expected none, expected shapes higher); row 20-21 9/2/1 in cols 16-23 generated vs. expected cols 20-26 flipped; bottom-right row 23-26 3s extended wrongly (generated full row 22-26 cols 4-11 vs. expected partial and positioned differently).
 * In training 2: Row 16-18 bottom-left empty in generated but expected 8/3 placements; attachment detection fails, placing non-attached blocks as attached (e.g., 9s treated as left-attached to non-existent red).
 * Sequential reflection order causes cumulative errors: top-right ok, but bottom-left overwrites with wrong y-flips, bottom-right inherits errors.
 * reflect_quadrant function is overly complex and buggy (e.g., red handling assumes orig_red_h/w from source even if no source red; attachment logic inverts wrongly for bottom (e.g., above_attach sets minr_new = maxr_t +1 but doesn't adjust h_new consistently); skips red copy if has_red_target but doesn't verify).
 * get_colors and get_bbox are helpful and mostly correct (accurate for single-block colors), but fill ignores overlap checks, leading to background corruption (e.g., overwriting 4s with shapes in wrong spots).
 * has_overlap is defined but not called in reflect_quadrant, so useless in practice—add it before fill to skip or adjust placements.
 * No handling for multi-component same-color shapes (bbox takes whole, but if disconnected, it merges wrongly—though examples seem connected).
 * Program assumes fixed quadrants (0-12/14-26), correct for 27x27 with 1-col/row divider at 13, but doesn't protect row 13 from fills.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it partially mirrors top-left shapes (e.g., 8/3 in rows 3-4 cols 3-7 flipped to top-right cols 20-24 ok, 9/2 in rows 5-6 cols 1-6 to bottom-right cols 18-23), but bottom-left has 3s in rows 15-18 cols 18-20 (unexpected, as source has no direct vertical mirror there—likely false attachment placing 3s relative to phantom red); row 7-8 has 1s in cols 5-6 (corrupting background, expected 4s); bottom-right row 19-22 has oversized 9/2/8 blocks (e.g., row 19 cols 12-19 9s extended beyond expected flip of source 9/2, and 8s in cols 22-26 too wide vs. source 8s); row 20 has 2 in col 5 (stray, not in expected symmetry); upper row 3 8s in cols 20-21 ok but row 4 8s overlap wrongly with 9/2; overall, lacks proper red anchoring (no color 2 in source visible, but generated places 2s in bottom without source, and resizes fail leading to protrusions into divider/background). This suggests the reflection logic over-applies flips without checking source red presence, and attachment detection misfires for vertical bottom placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual symmetry puzzle on a 27x27 grid (divided into four 13x13 quadrants separated by a central row of 1's at row 13 and a central column of 1's implied at col 13, though the middle row spans all columns), where the top-left quadrant provides a base pattern of numbers (1-9 representing colors/objects, 4 as empty), and the goal is to mirror it into the other three quadrants using horizontal, vertical, and 180-degree flips, while resolving overlaps by prioritizing non-4 values only if they match or the target is empty, and potentially applying vertical shifts in the top-right to align without conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid structure is fixed: rows 0-12 and cols 0-12 are given (top-left); row 13 is all 1's (central horizontal divider); cols 13 is likely all 1's vertically but not explicitly shown in outputs (may be implicit or overlaid); other areas start as 4's.
 * Flips must be exact: horizontal flip reverses columns; vertical reverses rows; 180 combines both; overlays only set non-4 values from the pattern if the target is 4 (empty) or already matches the value to avoid overwriting mismatches.
 * Top-right quadrant (rows 0-12, cols 14-26) requires a vertical shift (k rows up/down) to find a conflict-free alignment, as direct overlay may overlap with the central column or existing patterns; the shift search loops over possible k (0 to 12) and checks for non-matching non-4 values before placing.
 * Bottom-left (rows 14-26, cols 0-12) uses vertical flip overlaid directly at (14,0), but may need to consider central column overlaps or shifts if patterns extend.
 * Bottom-right (rows 14-26, cols 14-26) uses 180 flip overlaid directly at (14,14), but again, overlaps with central elements or shifted top-right bleed-over could cause issues.
 * Subtlety: The central cross (row 13 all 1's, col 13 all 1's?) acts as a divider that shouldn't be overwritten, and patterns may "bleed" or align across it, requiring conflict checks beyond simple overlay.
 * Non-4 values represent distinct objects/colors that must preserve shape/symmetry; mismatches indicate wrong flip or shift.
 * Grid size is 27x27 exactly (13+1+13), and all outputs must fill exactly without going out of bounds.
 * Overlays are non-destructive: only set if target is 4 or matches; if conflict found during shift search, try next k.
 * Potential miss: Vertical shifts only for top-right; other quadrants may need horizontal shifts or rotations if symmetries are diagonal or rotated.
 * No extraction of "objects" needed beyond the raw top-left slice; patterns are holistic, not individual blobs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return [row[::-1] for row in p]

def flip_vertical(p: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

        for j in range(n):
            p = pattern[i][j]
            if p != 4:
                r = row_start + i
                c = col_start + j
                if 0 <= r < len(g) and 0 <= c < len(g[0]):  # Bounds check added for safety
                    if g[r][c] == 4:
                        g[r][c] = p
                    # Note: Original only sets if 4, but to match, should check == p too, but code has if g[r][c] == 4: g[r][c] = p (incomplete for matches)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt correctly identifies the quadrant structure, extracts the top-left 13x13 accurately, and applies the right flip types (horizontal for top-right, vertical for bottom-left, 180 for bottom-right).
 * Basic overlay logic works for non-shifted placements, preserving the central row of 1's and not overwriting it.
 * What worked: Top-left remains unchanged; central row stays all 1's; some symmetric elements like 8's and 2/3 pairs in bottom-left/right match expected in partial areas (e.g., rows 4-6 in train 1).
 * What didn't work: Top-right shift logic fails to find the correct k, often defaulting to k=0 or early values, leading to misaligned placements (e.g., in train 1, generated has 1's bleeding into col 13 incorrectly, and bottom-right row 18 has scattered 2's instead of aligned 3's; in train 2, top-right has misaligned 3's and 9's).
 * Direct overlays for bottom quadrants ignore potential conflicts from shifted top-right or central column, causing overwrites (e.g., train 1 generated row 20 has extra 2's in bottom-left where expected has 3's; train 2 generated bottom-right row 20 has isolated 2's instead of extended 9/2 patterns).
 * Shift search in top-right checks only for non-4 conflicts but places even on matches incorrectly (code sets only if 4, but doesn't handle partial overlaps well); it breaks on first non-conflict k, which may not be optimal if later k better aligns overall symmetry.
 * No handling for central column (col 13) being all 1's, leading to invalid overwrites there (e.g., generated often places 1's from patterns into col 13 in top rows).
 * In train 1, generated bottom-right rows 18-20 mismatch expected by having fragmented 2/3/8 patterns (e.g., row 18 generated: 4's with 2's, expected: aligned 3's extending left); reason unknown but likely wrong 180 flip application post-shift bleed.
 * In train 2, generated top-right rows 3-5 have 3's and 8's misaligned (e.g., row 3 col 20: 3 in generated, but expected has it shifted); bottom-left row 23 has extra 2's where expected has 3/8.
 * No object extraction function attempted or needed; raw slicing is sufficient and helpful.
 * The conflict check loop is helpful but buggy (nested breaks may skip full checks; doesn't verify post-placement symmetry).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct, as it inherits the same flaws from training failures: top-right has unshifted or wrongly shifted placements (e.g., rows 0-1 have 2's and 9's in cols 20-26, but without expected alignment, and 1's appear in row 2 col 20-21 mismatched to symmetry).
 * Bottom-left in test has fragmented 1's and 2's (e.g., row 19: 1's in cols 20-21, but as bottom-left should be cols 0-12, this suggests bleed-over or wrong col_start=0; row 19 is actually bottom, but output shows misplaced 1's).
 * Bottom-right shows extended 9's and 2's (rows 20-21 cols 4-11 and 22-25), but row 23 has 2's in cols 18-25 mismatched to expected 8/3 symmetry, indicating 180 flip not resolving overlaps from top-right shift.
 * Central column (col 13) has 1's correctly in row 13, but top rows have 1's placed there from patterns, which shouldn't happen if divider is protected.
 * Overall, test output lacks cohesive symmetry (e.g., 9's in top-right rows 5-6 don't mirror top-left's implied patterns cleanly), and since trainings failed similarly, this likely misaligns the test input's objects like 9's and 3's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid, where the top-left 13x13 quadrant contains patterned non-4 values (representing shapes or colors like 1,2,3,8,9) amid 4's (likely empty space), with a fixed central row (index 13) of all 1's acting as a divider or axis. The task is to propagate these patterns to the other three 13x13 quadrants via specific mirroring operations—horizontal reflection for the top-right, vertical reflection for the bottom-left, and 180-degree rotation for the bottom-right—while resolving overlaps or conflicts without overwriting the central row or introducing inconsistencies.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is divided into four 13x13 quadrants separated by the central row of 1's (row 13, 0-indexed), which must remain unchanged and serves as a symmetry axis; mirrors should not alter it or propagate into it.
 * Mirroring is not simple copy-flip: horizontal mirror (top-right) reflects left-to-right across the vertical axis (column 13); vertical mirror (bottom-left) reflects top-to-bottom across the horizontal axis (row 13); 180-degree mirror (bottom-right) rotates the top-left 180 degrees around the center.
 * Conflicts arise when a mirrored value would overwrite a non-4 cell in the target quadrant that doesn't match; the previous attempt's "shift" logic (adding/subtracting 1 to row/column indices if conflict detected) is a heuristic but fails because it inconsistently skips or misplaces entire rows/columns, leading to incomplete or shifted patterns.
 * Non-4 values must be preserved and exactly matched in shape/size/orientation across mirrors; 4's are fillers and can be overwritten, but existing non-4's in input (if any) block propagation only if mismatched—though inputs seem to have only top-left filled.
 * Subtlety: Mirrors may overlap at quadrant edges (e.g., near row/column 13), requiring priority (e.g., apply in sequence: horizontal first, then vertical, then 180) or conflict resolution by keeping the "source" value; the central cross (row 13 and column 13) might need special handling to avoid bleeding.
 * Patterns are often symmetric internally (e.g., pairs like 8-8 or 2-2), suggesting blob-like objects that must be reflected as wholes; breaking them (e.g., partial copies) causes mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: The 180 mirror inverts both row and column (tr = n-1-r, tc = n-1-c), but quadrant size (13) means off-by-one errors around the center; also, inputs have no pre-filled values in other quadrants, so all propagation starts from top-left only.
 * Sequence matters: Applying mirrors in wrong order can cause self-overlaps (e.g., vertical mirror affecting what horizontal would place); detect conflicts per cell, not globally.
 * The 1's in the central row might represent a "mirror frame" and could influence adjacency rules, but they aren't propagated.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No new helpful functions were introduced in this attempt; the existing mirror functions (add_horizontal_mirror_top, add_vertical_mirror_bottom_left, add_180_mirror_bottom_right) attempt conflict detection via any() loops but are flawed due to global shift logic that skips rows instead of per-cell resolution. The copy step (out = [row[:] for row in g]) is basic but useful for non-destructive editing.

```python
# Example of a potentially helpful conflict-check function (not from attempt, but derived for future use)
def check_conflict(out: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, tr: int, tc: int) -> bool:
    return out[tr][tc] != 4 and out[tr][tc] != out[sr][sc]
# Could be used in mirrors to decide overwrite only if no conflict, else skip or resolve.
```

The attempt's functions are not fully helpful as-is (see below); no object-extraction functions were used or proposed, but one might be needed to identify "blobs" (connected non-4 groups) for whole-object mirroring to avoid partial breaks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly identifies the quadrant structure (13x13 top-left source, 27 total size) and basic mirror types (horizontal, vertical, 180), and preserves the central row of 1's untouched, which works in all outputs.
 * The copy-to-out and sequential application (horizontal -> vertical -> 180) is a good start, avoiding direct mutation of input.
 * Conflict detection via any() over the quadrant is a reasonable idea for deciding shifts, but it fails because the shift (0 or 1) is applied globally per mirror, causing entire rows to be skipped or offset (e.g., in train 1, bottom-left vertical mirror shifts incorrectly, leading to missing 3's and 2's in rows 18-20).
 * Train 1 generated: Top three rows match expected (all 4's with central 1); rows 3-7 partially match (8's and 2-3 patterns in top-left and mirrors) but bottom-left has extra 8's in row 3 col 20-21 (expected empty), row 18 has only two 2's instead of three, row 19 has 2-2-2 but shifted left without leading 4's/3's, row 20 has single 2 in col 3 (expected 2-3 pattern), row 21 has 8 in col 3 (expected none), and bottom-right has mismatched 8's in rows 22-24 (expected three 8's horizontally). These differences suggest over-propagation or wrong vertical/180 application, unknown why shift triggers incorrectly.
 * Train 2 generated: Top section (rows 0-7) matches expected closely (3's, 8's, 9-2-1 patterns mirrored), central row intact, but bottom half mismatches: row 19 has 2's but expected empty there, row 20 has partial 2's without full extension, rows 21-22 duplicate top-left 9-2-1 but shifted/missing 1's, row 23 has 9-2-1 but expected 1-2-9 flipped, row 24 has 8-3 but incomplete (missing pairs), row 25 has 3's but expected 3-3 pair, row 26 empty but expected 3-3. Differences indicate 180 mirror copies top-left directly without full inversion, and vertical doesn't flip properly; shift logic likely causes partial skips.
 * No object extraction was attempted, but patterns suggest it's needed (e.g., treat 2-2 as a unit); without it, cell-by-cell mirroring breaks connected shapes.
 * The shift heuristic in all three functions is broken/not helpful: it detects any mismatch but responds by offsetting all rows/columns, which distorts positions (e.g., tr = n-1-r + shift skips valid placements); better to resolve per cell (overwrite if target is 4 or matches, else skip).
 * Global quad=13 and n=27 are correct, but range(quad) assumes 0-12 indices without center adjustment.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially mirrors patterns (e.g., top-left 3-3-8-8 in rows 2-3 cols 20-26 matches horizontal flip; bottom-left has 2-2-2-9-9-9-9 in row 19 cols 19-26, suggesting vertical flip of top-right; 1-1 pairs in rows 6-7 and 18-19 indicate attempted 180 for bottom-right) but does not look correct overall.
 * Issues: Row 2 has 3-3-8-8 starting at col 20 (good for horizontal), but row 4 has 2-2-2-9x4 in bottom-left (expected vertical flip of row 1's empty? Wait, input not given, but assuming similar to trains, this overfills with unmirrored 9's); rows 5-6 have 9x4-2-2 in bottom-right but asymmetric (9's not paired as in trains); row 7 has 2-1-1 (partial, missing full flip); bottom rows 22-24 have 2-2-2-9x4 but row 23 repeats top-left without 180 inversion (expected rotated version with 1-1-2-2 or similar); empty areas like row 8-12 in bottom have scattered 1's not in expected symmetry. It mismatches because shift logic offsets 180 mirror (e.g., 1's appear in wrong quadrant edges), and no per-cell conflict resolution leads to incomplete blobs (e.g., 9's extend too far without matching source). Without expected test output, it's unclear exact target, but patterns don't consistently reflect wholes (e.g., 9-9-9-9 should be exact flip, not partial), indicating same flaws as trains—likely incorrect.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a symmetry-based visual puzzle on a 27x27 grid where the central row (index 13) and central column (index 13) form a fixed cross of 1's, dividing the grid into four quadrants. The objective is to complete the pattern by reflecting non-empty cells (values like 2, 3, 8, 9 representing colored or shaped elements) from given positions across the horizontal (left-right), vertical (top-bottom), and 180-degree axes into empty cells (4's) in the symmetric positions, ensuring the final grid is fully symmetric without overwriting existing non-4 values or the central cross.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The central cross (row 13 all 1's, column 13 all 1's in every row) must remain unchanged and acts as a mirror axis; reflections should not modify it or propagate across it directly.
 * Reflections are one-way propagation from known non-4 cells to symmetric empty (4) cells only, but the code's bidirectional checks (filling both directions) can cause over-propagation, where mirrored values spread unexpectedly in subsequent passes.
 * Apply reflections in a specific sequence (horizontal, then vertical, then 180) and limit iterations (10 is excessive; 1-2 cycles may suffice to avoid feedback loops that fill unintended areas).
 * Patterns appear to originate in one or more quadrants (often top-left or partial), and the goal is quadrant mirroring: e.g., top-left mirrors to top-right (horizontal), bottom-left (vertical), and bottom-right (180).
 * Empty cells (4's) are fillers; non-4 values represent distinct "objects" or colors that must be exactly mirrored in shape, size, and position without blending or altering (e.g., a 2x2 block of 8's mirrors as 2x2, not stretched).
 * Subtle: The loops must exclude the center (r==13 for horizontal/180, c==13 for vertical) to avoid tampering with the cross, but the half-range (range(13)) ensures only one side sources to the other without double-processing.
 * Order of operations matters: Horizontal first may mirror left-right, but if input has asymmetric placements, vertical/180 can then mirror those incorrectly if not isolated per axis.
 * No overwriting: If a target cell is already non-4, do not change it, even if source differs—this preserves input patterns in multiple quadrants.
 * Grid size (27x27, odd) means center is a single line; symmetries are point-symmetric around (13,13).
 * Potential for diagonal-like effects via 180, but only for opposite quadrants; not full rotational symmetry.
 * In examples, inputs likely have partial patterns (e.g., blobs of same numbers forming shapes), and outputs complete all quadrants identically reflected.
 * Watch for edge cases: isolated cells, lines touching the center (but not crossing), or patterns spanning half the grid.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions attempt axis-based propagation but are flawed due to bidirectional filling and excessive iterations. No custom types are defined. The deepcopy for grid copying is useful to avoid mutating inputs. No object extraction functions are present, but one could be added to identify "blobs" (connected non-4 regions) for verification:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)
```

```python
def identify_blobs(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:  # (value, row_start, col_start) for connected regions; helpful for debugging symmetries
    blobs = []
    visited = [[False] * 27 for _ in range(27)]
    for r in range(27):
        for c in range(27):
            if g[r][c] != 4 and not visited[r][c] and r != 13 and c != 13:  # Skip center cross
                val = g[r][c]
                # Simple flood-fill to find blob bounds (stub; expand for full connected component)
                min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = r, r, c, c
                # ... (implement DFS/BFS to expand bounds while same val and unvisited)
                blobs.append((val, min_r, min_c))  # Example: track start for mirroring checks
                # Mark visited in expansion
    return blobs
```

The reflect functions are partially helpful as a framework for propagation but broken in practice (see below); use as base but fix to one-way (e.g., only fill from "source" half to "target" half, assuming input is in source quadrants).

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses axis reflections to propagate non-4 values into 4's symmetrically, which correctly identifies the core mechanic of mirroring across the central cross and handles grid copying/deepcopy well.
 * What worked: Basic propagation logic fills some symmetric positions accurately (e.g., in train1, 8's in row 4 columns 5-6 and 20-21 match expected; central 1's preserved; skips center correctly).
 * What didn't work: Bidirectional filling (checking both directions per pair) combined with 10 iterations causes over-propagation and feedback, leading to extra or misplaced values (e.g., in train1 row 6, generated places 2 at col 3 and 23, but expected has 4's there—likely from 180 reflecting prematurely; in row 20, generated has 2,2,2,3 pattern mismatched vs expected 2,3 then 3,3,3,2,2,2).
 * In train1, generated row 5 has 2,2 at 20-21 but expected has none (should be 3,3,2,2 starting col 18); row 18-19 generated all 4's but expected has 2,2,2 at col 20-22 in row 19.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly fills row 4 with 2,8,3,2 symmetric but expected has 8,3 on one side only initially; row 20 generated has 2,2,2,2 but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1; lower rows like 23-24 have extra 2's and misplaced 1's vs expected 9's and 3's.
 * 180 reflection over-applies, creating diagonal symmetries that aren't intended (e.g., train2 row 21 generated 2,2,2,2,1 but expected has 9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1).
 * No object extraction; patterns are treated as individual cells, missing that non-4 groups (e.g., 2x2 blocks) must mirror as wholes.
 * Function `reflect_horizontal` is helpful for left-right but broken by skipping wrong axis (skips rows instead of columns? No, code skips r==13 but mirrors columns—naming confusing, but logic is left-right; still, bidirectional causes issues).
 * `reflect_vertical` similar: top-bottom logic sound but overfills in multi-iterations.
 * `reflect_180` essential for opposite quadrant but exacerbates mismatches by combining axes too early.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core reflection principle but fails on iteration control and directionality; trains both INCORRECT due to ~20-30% cell mismatches per example (exact count unknown but visible in blobs like extra 2's/3's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-propagates similarly to training examples, creating full symmetries that likely exceed the intended partial mirroring (e.g., row 3 has 8,8 at cols 3-4 and 22-23, but if input pattern is only in one quadrant like top-left, this bilateral fill ignores source-only propagation; row 5-6 has full 9,9,9,9 blocks symmetric top-bottom and left-right, but expected might have them only reflected to bottom-right via 180 without extras).
 * Row 7 has 1,1 at cols 5-6 and 20-21, but 1's should only be in center cross— this is a critical error, as non-center 1's overwrite empties incorrectly (likely from mispropagating center or blob error).
 * Row 19 has 1,1 symmetric, again invalid (1's only center); row 20 all 4's except center but expected likely mirrors upper patterns like 2's downward.
 * Bottom rows (23-24) mirror upper 8's/3's correctly in placement but may overfill if input lacks bottom sources.
 * Overall, test output looks overly symmetric and pollutes with non-center 1's, suggesting the program doesn't distinguish input quadrants properly—does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it violates fixed cross rule and creates artifacts not seen in expected trains.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in **every** train puzzle (both train 1 and train 2). I focused solely on common patterns without inferring or forcing unsolved transformations, high-level rules, or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., no inclusion of Light Blue interactions, as it appears only in train 2; no speculation on why y-positions shift in train 1 but not train 2). If a potential connection (e.g., exact transformations) cannot be explained consistently without solving, it is noted as unknown. Irrelevant static elements (e.g., fixed blue lines with no change or effect) are excluded.

1. **Colored block positions (bbox) and sizes (pixels) → Yellow background pixel counts (within same quadrant)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Non-yellow colored blocks (Red, Green, Maroon, Blue) located within a specific yellow quadrant's bbox directly reduce that yellow component's pixel count by exactly the block's pixel count. This holds for all quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) in both inputs and outputs of both trains.  
   - Example evidence: Quadrant area consistently totals ~169 pixels (13x13 grid units); yellow pixels + sum of contained block pixels = 169 in every case (e.g., train 1 top-right input: yellow 165 + Red 4 = 169; output: yellow 157 + Red 4 + Maroon 4 + Green 4 = 169). No exceptions or irregularities.  
   - Effect: Block placement "subtracts" from yellow area, indicating spatial overlap or occlusion within the quadrant. Yellow bbox and holes=1 remain fixed unless altered (see below), but pixel count always reflects this containment interaction.

2. **Top-left quadrant blocks (color, bbox x-position, pixels) → Top-right quadrant blocks (added instances)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Blocks in the top-left yellow quadrant (colors: Red, Green, Maroon, Blue; their x-positions, y-positions, and pixels) consistently cause the addition of new blocks in the top-right yellow quadrant with matching color and pixels, where the new block's x-position is a horizontal reflection over the vertical center line (x' ≈ 26 - x, preserving width). Y-positions are similar but not exactly consistent (same in train 2, shifted up by 1 unit in train 1). Existing top-right blocks (if matching) remain unchanged.  
   - Example evidence: Train 1 adds Maroon (reflected x20-21 from input x5-6), Green (reflected x18-19 from input x7-8); train 2 adds Green (x20 from x6), Maroon (x21 from x5), Blue (x18-19 from x7-8)—all matching color/pixels, with x-reflection. No such additions occur without a top-left counterpart.  
   - Effect: Top-left blocks "influence" top-right by replication via x-mirroring; y-adjustment is unknown (not consistent across trains). This does not affect bottom quadrants.

3. **Yellow holes property → Potential change from block placements (bottom-left quadrant only)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Yellow holes=1 in all input quadrants across both trains, but in outputs, bottom-left yellow holes changes to 0 (train 2) when multiple adjacent blocks are added within it (totaling >30 pixels). No other quadrants show this change consistently.  
   - Example evidence: Train 1 bottom-left output remains holes=1 (minimal additions: 2 pixels); train 2 bottom-left output holes=0 (additions: 52 pixels, including adjacent chains). Top quadrants and other bottoms stay holes=1.  
   - Effect: Dense/adjacent block placements within bottom-left may close the hole (altering connectivity), but the exact trigger is unknown (occurs only in one train output, but pattern ties to block density).

No other consistent interactions identified (e.g., bottom quadrant block additions show adjacency to existing blocks in both trains, but colors/sizes/transforms vary inconsistently—Green/Maroon in train 1, plus Blue/Light Blue in train 2; exact rules unknown. No consistent vertical mirroring or color-specific effects across all examples. Pixel counts for blocks themselves do not change unless duplicated, but duplication logic is unknown). Elements like the blue lines (fixed bbox/pixels) show no interactions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:53:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle on a 27x27 grid divided by a central row (13) and column (13) into upper/lower and left/right quadrants, where the goal is to fill empty cells (4's) based on symmetry rules (horizontal mirroring with reversal), vertical propagation (upwards in the upper half), pattern completion for isolated runs of 2's (transforming into 1's, 3's, or 9's based on side and parity), and vertical extension of rectangular 2-blobs into 8's, all while respecting boundaries, conflicts, and continuations across the central divider.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has a central divider (row 13 all 1's, column 13 all 1's except row 13), which acts as a barrier; no filling crosses it horizontally or vertically, and patterns cannot continue across it without specific checks (e.g., is_continuation prevents mirroring if a sequence continues from the row above across the divider).
 * Horizontal mirroring (left to right) reverses sequences (e.g., [a,b] mirrors to [b,a]) but only applies if the target area on the right (columns 14-26) is empty (4's) or matches exactly, with no conflicts; it skips short sequences (<2 cells), out-of-bounds targets, or if it's a vertical continuation from the prior row; upper/lower halves are treated separately but symmetrically.
 * Vertical propagation is unidirectional upwards in the upper half (rows 0-12): if a cell in row r-1 is empty (4) and row r has a value !=4, copy the value up, but only for non-divider rows/columns; no downward propagation or in lower half.
 * Isolated runs of 2's (bounded by 4's or grid edges, not adjacent to other non-4's) are completed differently by side: left (0-12) uses 9-prefix (half length for even >=2) +1-suffix (full length), or 3-suffix for odd/1; right (14-26) uses 1-prefix (full) +9-suffix (half), or 3-prefix for odd/1; only if prefix/suffix areas are empty (4's) and in bounds; runs must be fully isolated.
 * Rectangular blobs of 2's (solid rectangles, no holes) extend vertically: upper blobs (rows <13) extend upwards by their height if space is empty/8's; lower blobs (rows >13) extend downwards similarly; extensions fill with 8's only if no conflicts with non-4/non-8 cells; single-cell 2's count as blobs but may not extend if not rectangular in a meaningful way.
 * Order matters: mirroring first, then propagate up, then complete 2-runs, then extend blobs; iterations may be needed but current program does one pass; avoid overfilling (e.g., don't mirror if it would conflict with propagated values); 4 is empty/background, other numbers (1,2,3,8,9) are filled symbols/colors that block or propagate.
 * Subtle: Blobs for extension must be exactly rectangular (all cells in min-max bounds filled with 2's, no extras/missing); extract_blobs uses flood-fill (4-directional) skipping divider; runs of 2's are horizontal only in complete_two_runs; parity (even/odd length) dictates 9/1 vs 3 usage; no diagonal or multi-row runs considered in current rules.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from copy import deepcopy

def make_grid_copy(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return deepcopy(g)
```

```python
def is_continuation(g: List[List[int]], r: int, start: int, seq: List[int]) -> bool:
    if r == 0:
        return False
    prev_start = start
    prev_seq = []
    c = prev_start
    while c < 13 and g[r - 1][c] != 4:
        prev_seq.append(g[r - 1][c])
        c += 1
    return len(prev_seq) == len(seq) and prev_seq == seq and (c - len(prev_seq) == start)
```
(This checks if a sequence is a vertical continuation from the row above on the left side, preventing invalid mirroring; useful for symmetry rules but limited to left/upper.)

```python
def extract_blobs(g: List[List[int]], color: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    rows, cols = 27, 27
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    blobs = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(rows):
        if i == 13:
            continue
        for j in range(cols):
            if j == 13:
                continue
            if g[i][j] == color and not visited[i][j]:
                blob = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    blob.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx = x + dx
                        ny = y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and g[nx][ny] == color and not visited[nx][ny] and nx != 13 and ny != 13:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                if len(blob) >= 1:  # include singles for 2
                    blobs.append(blob)
    return blobs
```
(Flood-fill to find connected components of a color, skipping divider; essential for identifying 2-blobs for extension; 4-connected, handles multi-row shapes.)

```python
def is_rectangular(blob: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not blob:
        return False
    min_r = min(p[0] for p in blob)
    max_r = max(p[0] for p in blob)
    min_c = min(p[1] for p in blob)
    max_c = max(p[1] for p in blob)
    h = max_r - min_r + 1
    w = max_c - min_c + 1
    return len(blob) == h * w
```
(Checks if a blob fills a solid rectangle; critical for deciding if a 2-blob can be extended; assumes no holes but doesn't verify density beyond count—could be improved to check all cells in bounds are present.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt shown; it partially understands mirroring (applies reversal and conflict checks) and blob extraction but fails on precise placement and interactions between steps.
 * Mirroring works in basic cases (e.g., places reversed sequences on right if empty) but over-applies in upper half, creating extra 8's and 3's where expected has empties (e.g., Train 1 row 3: generated [4,4,4,4,4,8,8,4,...] vs expected all 4's except later 8's).
 * Vertical propagation is too aggressive: fills upwards indiscriminately, leading to unwanted 1's propagating into upper rows where they shouldn't (e.g., Train 1 rows 0-2 all have 1 in col 13, but expected has 4's; actually col 13 is divider, but code skips it—issue is elsewhere).
 * complete_two_runs correctly identifies isolated 2-runs and applies side-specific rules (9/1 left, 1/9 right, 3 for odd) but misplaces them due to prior steps' errors (e.g., Train 1 row 5: generated 3's at cols 7-8 left but expected at 18-19 right; also adds extra 3's on right where not isolated).
 * Blob extension identifies rectangles but extends incorrectly: places 8's in wrong positions or overfills (e.g., Train 1 row 20: generated 2,3 at cols 3-4 left vs expected; row 21: extra 8 at col 3; Train 2 row 4: extra 9's and 1's misplaced).
 * is_continuation prevents some invalid mirrors but is left-only and doesn't handle right-side or lower half equivalents, missing symmetric continuations.
 * extract_blobs and is_rectangular are helpful and mostly correct (find connected 2's, check rectangle) but extension logic in extend_two_blobs_with_eights assumes uniform height extension and doesn't re-check after prior fills, causing conflicts (e.g., Train 2 lower extensions add 8's where 3's should block).
 * vertical_propagate_up_upper is unhelpful/broken: only upper half, no lower equivalent, and copies without considering if source is final (runs after mirroring but before completing 2's, so propagates unfinalized values).
 * mirror_left_to_right is partially helpful (handles reversal, conflicts, continuations) but skips too much (e.g., doesn't mirror short seq or non-continuations properly) and doesn't have a right-to-left variant if needed for asymmetry.
 * Overall, attempt shows core understanding of mirroring/reversal, run completion by side/parity, and blob extension, but fails integration (order causes cascading errors) and misses lower-half propagation/mirroring subtleties; Train 1 mismatches in ~10-15 cells per half (extra 8's/3's, missing placements); Train 2 worse (~20+ mismatches, e.g., row 20-21: generated 1's/2's/9's in wrong spots vs expected empties/3's).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills with 8's, 9's, 2's, and 1's in ways that violate isolation and symmetry (e.g., upper left row 2: 8's and 3's at cols 3-7, but if input has partial patterns, this seems to mirror prematurely without checking continuations; lower right row 20: 1's at cols 14-18 followed by 2's/9's, but expected likely has more isolated 3-prefix on right for odd runs, not this mix—looks like complete_two_runs applied to non-isolated 2's post-propagation).
 * Extra 9's in upper right (rows 4-6, cols 22-25) suggest mirroring added them without conflict check against existing 2's; lower left extensions add 8's (rows 23-26, cols 18-21) but probably overstep bounds or ignore rectangular check.
 * Missing vertical propagation in lower half (no downward copy), leading to unfilled areas (e.g., rows 20-22 left have partial 1's/2's but no full suffix); blobs extended incorrectly (e.g., row 7-8 left 1's not turned into runs properly).
 * Does not make sense overall: violates subtlety of only filling if isolated/empty, creates non-symmetric patterns (left has extra 3's in row 3, right lacks mirrors); likely correct test would have more 3's for odd runs on right lower, symmetric 8-extensions without overlaps, and empties preserved where no rule applies.

[2025-10-02 04:53:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

[2025-10-02 05:11:39] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (likely 27x27 cells, with numbers representing colors or objects: 1,2,3,8,9 as distinct elements, 4 as background/empty) where the goal is to complete a partially filled grid by applying symmetry rules, such as 180-degree rotational symmetry, horizontal/vertical mirroring (especially upper-right to lower-left), and specific propagation rules for certain objects (e.g., extending segments or filling adjacent empties based on patterns like isolated 2's). The program normalizes the grid (mapping to 0-5 for processing) and attempts to fill via mirroring and rotation, but fails to fully match expected completions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is large (27 rows x 27 columns based on output lengths), but the code assumes 13x13 processing loops, which may cause incomplete coverage or off-by-one errors in filling (e.g., only processing first 13 rows/columns explicitly).
 * Normalization maps 4 (background) to 0, keeps 1-3, maps 8 to 5 and 9 to 4; denormalization reverses this, but unhandled values (e.g., potential 5,6,7) default to themselves, risking corruption if new values appear during filling.
 * 180-degree rotational symmetry: Every filled cell at (r,c) must mirror to (h-1-r, w-1-c); empties (0) get filled if the symmetric position is filled, but only applied after other steps, which can lead to incomplete propagation.
 * Upper-right filling: Scans rows for contiguous colored segments on the left, attempts to mirror them horizontally to the right side (reversing order? via w-1-end_c to w-1-start_c); if direct mirror conflicts (non-empty non-matching cell), falls back to searching nearby rows above/below for empty slots to place the segment, but this is row-specific and only for r<13, missing lower grid parts.
 * Lower-left completion: Targets isolated 2's (no adjacent 2's in cardinal directions) in rows >=14, filling right with 3 and below with 5 (but 5 isn't in map_to, so it stays 5 and denormalizes to 5, which may be invalid); this seems aimed at extending chain-like objects but only applies downward/rightward and ignores symmetries.
 * Subtle elements: Mirroring may need to preserve segment length and color but reverse orientation; fallback placement in other rows suggests "gravity" or priority to closest empty row, but code prefers upward then downward search, which may not match puzzle intent. Isolated checks (is_single) only consider adjacent 2's, missing diagonal or multi-step connections. No vertical mirroring or full grid propagation (e.g., after filling one area, re-run symmetries). Objects like 8/9 may represent different shapes (e.g., 8 as blocks, 9 as outlines) that need distinct rules. The 14th row (index 13) is all 1's in examples, possibly a fixed divider or frame. Empties (4/0) should not be overwritten unless symmetry demands it, but code sometimes does. Processing order matters: normalize -> upper-right fill -> 180 fill -> lower-left, but 180 should perhaps be earlier/later for consistency.
 * Across attempts (this is the only one provided, but inferred from code structure): No handling for vertical symmetries or diagonal propagations; no iterative filling (e.g., repeat until no changes); ignores potential object grouping (e.g., connected components of same color); lower-left rule uses hardcoded row 14+ and directions, which may not generalize.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def normalize(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    map_to = {4: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 8: 5, 9: 4}
    return [[map_to.get(cell, cell) for cell in row] for row in g]

def denormalize(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    map_back = {0: 4, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 9, 5: 8}
    return [[map_back.get(cell, cell) for cell in row] for row in g]
```
These are useful for simplifying the grid to 0-5 (0=empty) during processing and mapping back, assuming only these colors appear; extend map_to/map_back if more colors emerge.

```python
def is_single(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
        if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and g[nr][nc] == 2:
            return False
    return True
```
This correctly identifies isolated 2's for targeted filling, but limit to cardinal directions only (no diagonals) and expand if puzzle considers 8-connected.

No other functions from this attempt are helpful; see unhelpful below.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt provided; it demonstrates partial understanding of symmetries (e.g., 180 rotation and horizontal mirroring) but fails both training examples completely.
 * Training example 1: Generated incorrectly fills row 5 (0-indexed row 5, cols 18-21) with [4,4,2,2] instead of expected [3,3,2,2]; row 18 with [4,4,3,3,3,2,2,2] instead of [4,4,3,3,3,2,2,2] (minor, but row 19/20 have extra 3's or misplacements); row 21 has [4,4,4,2,3,...] matching expected, but row 22 has [4,4,4,8,4,...] instead of [4,4,4,8,4,...] wait, seems partial match but overall incorrect due to missing extensions (e.g., 8's in row 22 cols 20-22 should be [4,4,4,8,8,8] per expected, but generated has only one 8); row 6/7 have correct [2,2,3,3] but propagation fails downward. What worked: Basic 180 symmetry filled some 8's and 2's correctly in upper half; normalization preserved colors. What didn't: Upper-right fill didn't propagate 3's/2's fully to lower right (e.g., expected 3's in row 18 cols 16-18 missing); lower-left didn't trigger for some isolated 2's (e.g., row 19 should have more 3's rightward); fallback row placement in fill_upper_right likely overwrote or skipped, causing asymmetric empties.
 * Training example 2: Generated places 1's incorrectly in row 19 cols 18-19 as [1,2,2,2] instead of expected [1,1,2,2,9]; row 20 similar mismatch; row 21 has [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1] but expected shifts to [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1] (close but off); row 23 has [4,4,9,9,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1] matching partially, but lower rows like 24 have [4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3] instead of expected [4,4,4,4,8,8,3,3] (match) but 25/26 mismatch in 3's placement. What worked: Some mirroring of 8/3 in upper (rows 3-5 correct for 3's); 9/2 segments in rows 5-6 mirrored somewhat. What didn't: Lower-left filling added unwanted 1's or failed to extend 2's into 9's/3's (e.g., row 19 should propagate 1's right but code doesn't handle 1's); 180 fill didn't catch all rotations (e.g., row 20's 2's not fully symmetric to upper 9's); upper-right fallback placed segments in wrong rows, causing blob shape distortions (e.g., 2's chains broken).
 * Overall: Code handles contiguous segment detection in fill_upper_right well for left-to-right mirroring but breaks on conflicts (fallback is heuristic, not rule-based, leading to wrong placements); 180 fill is simple and mostly correct but applied too late; lower-left is too narrow (only for 2's, rows>=14, specific directions) and introduces invalid 5's. No object extraction (e.g., finding connected components) to group same-color blobs for symmetric copying, which is essential for complex shapes like chains of 2/3/9.
 * Function `fill_upper_right` is partially helpful for segment mirroring but broken for full grid (limited to 13x13, incomplete fallback logic places in arbitrary rows without symmetry check).
 * Function `fill_180` is helpful and mostly correct for point symmetries but should be iterative.
 * Function `complete_lower_left` is not helpful/broken: Hardcoded to 2's only, uses undefined 5 (stays 5 post-denorm, invalid), ignores upper grid, and doesn't propagate symmetrically; don't use in future without major fixes.
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., connected components of 2's or 8's) were included, which would be essential to identify and mirror entire shapes rather than row-by-row segments.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and shows similar issues as trainings: Partial symmetries (e.g., rows 3-4 have 8,3 mirroring somewhat, rows 5-6 have 9,2 extended but asymmetric); row 19 has [4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,4,4,4,4,4,4,1,1,4,4,4,4,4] with isolated 1's that should likely propagate or mirror via 180 to upper (but upper row 7 has 1's already, suggesting incomplete); row 20 has 2's chain but no extension to 3's rightward/downward as in trainings; row 22 has [4,4,4,4,4,2,3,4,...2,2,2,2,9,9,9,9,4] introducing a 3 that may be from lower-left rule but breaks isolation (2 at col5 not single); row 23 has 8's but only two instead of symmetric three or more; overall lacks full 180 (e.g., lower right 9's in row 21-22 not mirrored to upper left properly) and has extra/missing fills (e.g., row 2 has 3's not in upper symmetric positions). It doesn't make sense as a complete puzzle solution—shapes like 9/2 blobs are half-filled, and divider row 13 is correct (all 1's), but propagations ignore vertical/horizontal balances. To handle test, need better object grouping (e.g., treat 9-2 as connected chain) and full-grid iterative symmetry application.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
