=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 02:56:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 03:16:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-completion puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with 0s as empty cells and positive integers as colors) must be filled by detecting and extending arithmetic progression patterns of the same color in rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical), using the GCD of position differences to determine the period and fill matching positions. The approach switches between row-wise and column-wise processing based on grid dimensions (taller grids prioritize horizontal, wider prioritize vertical), and handles both uniform-color patterns and mixed overrides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on 1-indexed positions; only consider non-zero cells for computing differences and GCD, and fill only empty (0) cells or reinforce existing matches without overwriting mismatches.
 * For uniform colors in a row/column, compute GCD of sorted position differences, then fill every position congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, extending beyond observed positions if possible.
 * For mixed colors, first group by color and apply per-color filling (without overriding existing different colors), then optionally override sparse mixed patterns by filling with the color at the minimum position if the observed points exactly match the expected count for the span.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > columns, prioritize horizontal completion; else, do vertical per-color then mixed override— this prevents overfilling in non-dominant directions.
 * Subtlety: In mixed vertical cases, the override only applies if the number of observed points equals the expected in the arithmetic sequence span, to avoid hallucinating dense patterns; also, filling stops at grid bounds.
 * Easy to miss: GCD computation ignores empty lists (defaults to 1, but skips if <2 points); per-color vertical filling allows reinforcing but not overwriting conflicting colors; horizontal assumes all same color for full periodic fill, but vertical mixed uses min-color override only under strict conditions.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), considerations include deep-copying grids to avoid mutation, sorting positions, and handling edge cases like single points (skip) or full spans.
 * Potential overreach: The mixed override might incorrectly fill if GCD leads to exact match count but wrong color propagation; test grids may have overlapping row/column constraints that require sequential application without conflicts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD of differences; essential for period detection and used in all pattern extensions.)

```python
def horizontal_completion(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for i in range(num_rows):
        row = grid[i]
        pos_color = [(j + 1, row[j]) for j in range(num_cols) if row[j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        all_same = all(c == colors[0] for c in colors)
        if all_same:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            r = poss[0] % d
            c = colors[0]
            for jj in range(1, num_cols + 1):
                if jj % d == r:
                    row[jj - 1] = c
        else:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            min_p = poss[0]
            max_p = poss[-1]
            color_max = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == max_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                row[current - 1][j] = color_max  # Note: Bug here, should be row[current - 1] = color_max? Wait, no, this is horizontal but code has row[jj-1], but in else it's incomplete.
    return grid
```
(This function works for uniform horizontal but has a bug in the mixed else branch: it sets row[current - 1][j] which assumes vertical indexing; it's unhelpful as-is for mixed horizontal and should be avoided or fixed. The uniform part is helpful.)

```python
def vertical_per_color_same(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):
        col_pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(col_pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        col_colors = set(c for _, c in col_pos_color)
        for cc in col_colors:
            group_pos = sorted(p for p, c in col_pos_color if c == cc)
            group_k = len(group_pos)
            if group_k < 2:
                continue
            group_diffs = [group_pos[m + 1] - group_pos[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
            group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
            group_r = group_pos[0] % group_d
            for ii in range(1, num_rows + 1):
                if ii % group_d == group_r:
                    if grid[ii - 1][j] == 0 or grid[ii - 1][j] == cc:
                        grid[ii - 1][j] = cc
    return grid
```
(This is helpful for per-color vertical filling without conflicts; key for mixed columns where colors are grouped separately.)

```python
def vertical_mixed_override(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):
        pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        colors_set = set(colors)
        if len(colors_set) <= 1:
            continue
        diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
        d = compute_gcd(diffs)
        min_p = poss[0]
        max_p = poss[-1]
        num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
        if num_exp == k:
            color_min = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                grid[current - 1][j] = color_min
    return grid
```
(This is conditionally helpful for overriding mixed verticals under exact-span conditions, but may overfill if not all points are intended; useful for sparse tests but risky.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly handles training examples 1-3 by applying orientation-based processing and GCD patterns.
 * Missed full horizontal mixed handling: the else branch in horizontal_completion has a indexing bug (uses [j] but j undefined, likely copy-paste error from vertical), leading to no-op or crash in mixed rows.
 * Vertical mixed override uses min-color fill, but in some cases (e.g., test) it might need max or average; unknown why it underfills test.
 * Per-color vertical is essential for avoiding color conflicts in mixed columns, and it worked for training.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components); this puzzle is purely positional arithmetic, not blob-based, so object extraction would be unhelpful or broken.
 * Training successes suggest core GCD and uniform filling works, but test failure indicates subtlety in mixed or orientation for irregular grids.
 * The program function's orientation switch (rows > cols for horizontal) is key but may fail if test grid is square-ish or has cross-patterns needing both directions iteratively.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 21-column grid (inferred from row lengths) that remains extremely sparse, with only scattered numbers like 7s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 1s, 8s, 4s in positions matching the input (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 10, 2 at col 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at col 7, 5s at 20-21), and vast zeros elsewhere—no evident filling occurred beyond input.
 * This does not look correct: Expected output should show periodic extensions, e.g., the two 2s in row 2 (positions ~18 and 21, diff 3) might GCD to 3 and fill every 3rd position with 2 horizontally, but nothing is added; similarly, vertical 5s in col 20 (rows 3-4) should extend downward if uniform, but no change.
 * Underfilling suggests the program skipped most cases: likely because test grid has few lines with >=2 same-color points (many singles or mixed without exact span), and the horizontal mixed bug prevented any row fills; vertical per-color/mixed only touched columns with multiples but didn't propagate due to short spans or conflicts.
 * Differences from expected: No arithmetic fills visible (e.g., col 21 has 2,5,2,?,6,? which mixes colors without GCD match, so skipped correctly? But test likely needs more aggressive extension); output matches input almost exactly, implying no meaningful completion—probably wrong as puzzles expect denser grids.
 * To handle test, need bug fix in horizontal mixed, perhaps iterative row-col passes, or looser override conditions (e.g., fill if num_exp >= k).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 03:16:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 03:32:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or values) where the goal is to complete partially filled rows and columns by extending patterns, primarily arithmetic progressions of non-zero values into zero positions, with different handling for horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) directions based on grid dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify non-zero positions (S) in a line (row or column); if fewer than 2, no filling occurs.
 * For perfect arithmetic progressions (all differences equal), extend forward and backward from the starting position using the common difference d, overwriting zeros but not existing values (in vertical case, it checks if out[pos] == 0).
 * If not a perfect AP in horizontal (non-vertical), compute GCD of all differences and fill every GCD steps from start to end using the last non-zero value c.
 * In vertical (columns), handle per color separately: for each color's positions, check if they form a perfect AP and extend only into zeros if it's a perfect AP for that color.
 * Grid orientation matters: if more rows than columns, process rows horizontally; else, process columns vertically and reconstruct the grid.
 * Subtlety: Vertical processing groups by color and only extends perfect APs per color, avoiding overwriting; horizontal non-AP uses GCD filling with last value, which may not align with per-color logic.
 * Easy to miss: No filling if single non-zero or no pattern; GCD filling is only for horizontal non-AP and uses last value, not first or average; vertical doesn't use GCD, sticking to per-color perfect APs.
 * Considerations: Potential overwriting issues (code avoids in vertical but not explicitly in horizontal AP); assumes grid is rectangular; numbers are colors, so same number = same pattern group.

(Note: These are the core functions from the attempt; they handle line processing and grid orientation. No additional types like classes were used, but List[List[int]] for grid is implicit.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1, 2, and 3, demonstrating understanding of AP extension in both directions and GCD-based filling for horizontal non-AP cases.
 * Worked well for perfect APs by extending with constant value from start position.
 * Vertical per-color AP detection and zero-only filling avoided conflicts effectively in training cases.
 * Did not work fully for the test input: generated output shows heavy filling of 5's in what appears to be column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 have 5 in position 19, and some extras like row 2 has two 5's, row 3 has 5 and 2), but leaves most of the grid as zeros, suggesting incomplete pattern detection (e.g., no horizontal fillings observed, and vertical fillings seem biased toward 5's without addressing other colors like 7,2,6, etc., properly).
 * GCD filling in horizontal non-AP is limited to range S[0] to S[-1] and uses last value, which may miss extensions beyond the observed non-zeros or use wrong color in multi-color lines.
 * Vertical processing only extends perfect APs per color but ignores non-AP colors entirely, potentially missing GCD-like logic for vertical non-AP (asymmetry with horizontal).
 * No extraction functions for objects like "blobs" or connected components were used or needed; the line-based approach fits the pattern-extension puzzle but may overlook diagonal or multi-line interactions.
 * Function process_line is helpful and core to the solution, correctly copying existing non-zeros to output.
 * Overall, demonstrates core AP and GCD understanding but incomplete for test due to unhandled cases like mixed colors in vertical or non-extending beyond bounds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 9x21 grid (incomplete last row), with most positions still 0, but noticeable vertical fillings of 5's in column 19 across rows 0-8 (e.g., [...,5] in row 0, [...,5,2] in row 1, [...,5,5] in row 2, etc.), and some extras like 2 in row 1 col 20, 5 in row 3 col 20? Wait, formatting suggests column 19 is mostly 5's, column 20 has mixed 0,2,5,2,0,6,0,8,7.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely fill more patterns, such as horizontal APs (e.g., the 5's in column 19 suggest a vertical AP of 5's every 1 row, but code's vertical processing should catch that if perfect AP; however, other elements like the 7 in row 1 col 9, 9 in row 2 col 6, 6 in row 3 col 3, etc., seem unextended, leaving isolated non-zeros without filling nearby zeros).
 * Missing horizontal extensions entirely (e.g., row 6 has 1 at col 13 and 6 at col 15, diff=2, but no filling shown; if AP, should extend).
 * Bias toward filling 5's suggests the per-color vertical logic caught a strong AP for 5 (positions in col 19? Wait, no—the input isn't shown, but output implies input had 5's in col 19 at intervals, extended fully), but ignored or failed on other colors like 2 (appears in row 1 col 17 and 20, row 3 col 20, row 7 col 17, row 8 col 18? Not extended consistently).
 * Looks incomplete because ~90% zeros remain, whereas expected should propagate patterns more aggressively (e.g., if vertical since 9 rows < 21 cols? Code would process columns vertically, but output shows uneven filling, possibly missing GCD for non-AP columns).
 * Subtle difference: In row 8, ends with 5,7—may have partially filled a pattern, but unclear if correct without input; overall, does not match a "completed" puzzle grid, as patterns like the diagonal-ish 2's or scattered numbers aren't resolved.

[2025-10-03 03:32:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-completion puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with 0s as empty cells and positive integers as colors) must be filled by detecting and extending arithmetic progression patterns of the same color in rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical), using the GCD of position differences to determine the period and fill matching positions. The approach switches between row-wise and column-wise processing based on grid dimensions (taller grids prioritize horizontal, wider prioritize vertical), and handles both uniform-color patterns and mixed overrides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on 1-indexed positions; only consider non-zero cells for computing differences and GCD, and fill only empty (0) cells or reinforce existing matches without overwriting mismatches.
 * For uniform colors in a row/column, compute GCD of sorted position differences, then fill every position congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, extending beyond observed positions if possible.
 * For mixed colors, first group by color and apply per-color filling (without overriding existing different colors), then optionally override sparse mixed patterns by filling with the color at the minimum position if the observed points exactly match the expected count for the span.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > columns, prioritize horizontal completion; else, do vertical per-color then mixed override— this prevents overfilling in non-dominant directions.
 * Subtlety: In mixed vertical cases, the override only applies if the number of observed points equals the expected in the arithmetic sequence span, to avoid hallucinating dense patterns; also, filling stops at grid bounds.
 * Easy to miss: GCD computation ignores empty lists (defaults to 1, but skips if <2 points); per-color vertical filling allows reinforcing but not overwriting conflicting colors; horizontal assumes all same color for full periodic fill, but vertical mixed uses min-color override only under strict conditions.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), considerations include deep-copying grids to avoid mutation, sorting positions, and handling edge cases like single points (skip) or full spans.
 * Potential overreach: The mixed override might incorrectly fill if GCD leads to exact match count but wrong color propagation; test grids may have overlapping row/column constraints that require sequential application without conflicts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD of differences; essential for period detection and used in all pattern extensions.)

```python
def horizontal_completion(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for i in range(num_rows):
        row = grid[i]
        pos_color = [(j + 1, row[j]) for j in range(num_cols) if row[j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        all_same = all(c == colors[0] for c in colors)
        if all_same:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            r = poss[0] % d
            c = colors[0]
            for jj in range(1, num_cols + 1):
                if jj % d == r:
                    row[jj - 1] = c
        else:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            min_p = poss[0]
            max_p = poss[-1]
            color_max = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == max_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                row[current - 1][j] = color_max  # Note: Bug here, should be row[current - 1] = color_max? Wait, no, this is horizontal but code has row[jj-1], but in else it's incomplete.
    return grid
```
(This function works for uniform horizontal but has a bug in the mixed else branch: it sets row[current - 1][j] which assumes vertical indexing; it's unhelpful as-is for mixed horizontal and should be avoided or fixed. The uniform part is helpful.)

```python
def vertical_per_color_same(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):
        col_pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(col_pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        col_colors = set(c for _, c in col_pos_color)
        for cc in col_colors:
            group_pos = sorted(p for p, c in col_pos_color if c == cc)
            group_k = len(group_pos)
            if group_k < 2:
                continue
            group_diffs = [group_pos[m + 1] - group_pos[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
            group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
            group_r = group_pos[0] % group_d
            for ii in range(1, num_rows + 1):
                if ii % group_d == group_r:
                    if grid[ii - 1][j] == 0 or grid[ii - 1][j] == cc:
                        grid[ii - 1][j] = cc
    return grid
```
(This is helpful for per-color vertical filling without conflicts; key for mixed columns where colors are grouped separately.)

```python
def vertical_mixed_override(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):
        pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        colors_set = set(colors)
        if len(colors_set) <= 1:
            continue
        diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
        d = compute_gcd(diffs)
        min_p = poss[0]
        max_p = poss[-1]
        num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
        if num_exp == k:
            color_min = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                grid[current - 1][j] = color_min
    return grid
```
(This is conditionally helpful for overriding mixed verticals under exact-span conditions, but may overfill if not all points are intended; useful for sparse tests but risky.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly handles training examples 1-3 by applying orientation-based processing and GCD patterns.
 * Missed full horizontal mixed handling: the else branch in horizontal_completion has a indexing bug (uses [j] but j undefined, likely copy-paste error from vertical), leading to no-op or crash in mixed rows.
 * Vertical mixed override uses min-color fill, but in some cases (e.g., test) it might need max or average; unknown why it underfills test.
 * Per-color vertical is essential for avoiding color conflicts in mixed columns, and it worked for training.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components); this puzzle is purely positional arithmetic, not blob-based, so object extraction would be unhelpful or broken.
 * Training successes suggest core GCD and uniform filling works, but test failure indicates subtlety in mixed or orientation for irregular grids.
 * The program function's orientation switch (rows > cols for horizontal) is key but may fail if test grid is square-ish or has cross-patterns needing both directions iteratively.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 21-column grid (inferred from row lengths) that remains extremely sparse, with only scattered numbers like 7s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 1s, 8s, 4s in positions matching the input (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 10, 2 at col 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at col 7, 5s at 20-21), and vast zeros elsewhere—no evident filling occurred beyond input.
 * This does not look correct: Expected output should show periodic extensions, e.g., the two 2s in row 2 (positions ~18 and 21, diff 3) might GCD to 3 and fill every 3rd position with 2 horizontally, but nothing is added; similarly, vertical 5s in col 20 (rows 3-4) should extend downward if uniform, but no change.
 * Underfilling suggests the program skipped most cases: likely because test grid has few lines with >=2 same-color points (many singles or mixed without exact span), and the horizontal mixed bug prevented any row fills; vertical per-color/mixed only touched columns with multiples but didn't propagate due to short spans or conflicts.
 * Differences from expected: No arithmetic fills visible (e.g., col 21 has 2,5,2,?,6,? which mixes colors without GCD match, so skipped correctly? But test likely needs more aggressive extension); output matches input almost exactly, implying no meaningful completion—probably wrong as puzzles expect denser grids.
 * To handle test, need bug fix in horizontal mixed, perhaps iterative row-col passes, or looser override conditions (e.g., fill if num_exp >= k).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or values) where the goal is to complete partially filled rows and columns by extending patterns, primarily arithmetic progressions of non-zero values into zero positions, with different handling for horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) directions based on grid dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify non-zero positions (S) in a line (row or column); if fewer than 2, no filling occurs.
 * For perfect arithmetic progressions (all differences equal), extend forward and backward from the starting position using the common difference d, overwriting zeros but not existing values (in vertical case, it checks if out[pos] == 0).
 * If not a perfect AP in horizontal (non-vertical), compute GCD of all differences and fill every GCD steps from start to end using the last non-zero value c.
 * In vertical (columns), handle per color separately: for each color's positions, check if they form a perfect AP and extend only into zeros if it's a perfect AP for that color.
 * Grid orientation matters: if more rows than columns, process rows horizontally; else, process columns vertically and reconstruct the grid.
 * Subtlety: Vertical processing groups by color and only extends perfect APs per color, avoiding overwriting; horizontal non-AP uses GCD filling with last value, which may not align with per-color logic.
 * Easy to miss: No filling if single non-zero or no pattern; GCD filling is only for horizontal non-AP and uses last value, not first or average; vertical doesn't use GCD, sticking to per-color perfect APs.
 * Considerations: Potential overwriting issues (code avoids in vertical but not explicitly in horizontal AP); assumes grid is rectangular; numbers are colors, so same number = same pattern group.

Wait, no—the input isn't shown, but output implies input had 5's in col 19 at intervals, extended fully), but ignored or failed on other colors like 2 (appears in row 1 col 17 and 20, row 3 col 20, row 7 col 17, row 8 col 18? Not extended consistently).
 * Looks incomplete because ~90% zeros remain, whereas expected should propagate patterns more aggressively (e.g., if vertical since 9 rows < 21 cols? Code would process columns vertically, but output shows uneven filling, possibly missing GCD for non-AP columns).
 * Subtle difference: In row 8, ends with 5,7—may have partially filled a pattern, but unclear if correct without input; overall, does not match a "completed" puzzle grid, as patterns like the diagonal-ish 2's or scattered numbers aren't resolved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 03:44:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a sparse grid of numbered cells (representing colors) where the task is to fill in the blank cells (0s) by extending arithmetic progression patterns either horizontally across rows or vertically down columns, determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of position differences for placed colors. The direction of processing (horizontal if more rows than columns, vertical otherwise) suggests the puzzle adapts to grid aspect ratio, with rules prioritizing uniform color extensions, per-color independent fillings, and overrides for mixed-color cases to avoid conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on positions (1-indexed) of non-zero cells; compute differences between consecutive positions of the same color (or all positions if uniform), then use GCD as the step size (d) to extend fillings starting from the first position's residue (r = pos[0] % d).
 * For uniform colors in a line (row or column), fill every d steps across the entire length if the pattern is consistent; for mixed colors, limit filling to the span between min and max positions to avoid over-extension.
 * Per-color processing is crucial for vertical cases: treat each color independently to extend its own AP without interfering with others initially, only overriding zeros or matching cells.
 * Mixed-color overrides should check if the number of expected positions in the AP equals the number of actual placements (indicating a sparse uniform fill disguised as mixed), then fill the span with the starting color; this handles cases where multiple colors appear but follow a single underlying pattern.
 * Direction decision (horizontal if num_rows > num_cols, else vertical) is key, but vertical processing requires two passes: per-color extension first (to build independent patterns), then mixed override (to unify sparse cases).
 * Subtle edge cases: single or zero placements do nothing; GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1 (but skipped); avoid overwriting existing non-matching cells in per-color extensions; positions must be sorted for diff calculation.
 * Grid is list of lists, output must be deep copy to avoid mutating input; assume rectangular grid with consistent lengths.
 * Potential for conflicts in vertical mixed cases: if after per-color, a column has interleaved colors, the mixed override may not trigger correctly if num_exp != k due to partial fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD computation on position differences; reliable and handles empty lists gracefully.)

```python
def per_color_extension(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_by_color = {}
    for i in range(length):
        c = line[i]
        if c != 0:
            if c not in pos_by_color:
                pos_by_color[c] = []
            pos_by_color[c].append(i + 1)
    for cc, group_poss in pos_by_color.items():
        group_k = len(group_poss)
        if group_k < 2:
            continue
        group_poss = sorted(group_poss)
        group_diffs = [group_poss[m + 1] - group_poss[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
        group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
        group_r = group_poss[0] % group_d
        for p in range(1, length + 1):
            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == cc:
                    out[p - 1] = cc
    return out
```
(This function is helpful for independent color extensions in vertical processing; it groups positions by color, computes per-color GCD/AP, and fills safely without overwriting mismatches—essential for handling multi-color columns.)

```python
def mixed_override_line(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_color = [(i + 1, line[i]) for i in range(length) if line[i] != 0]
    k = len(pos_color)
    if k < 2:
        return out
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
    colors_set = set(colors)
    if len(colors_set) <= 1:
        return out
    diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    min_p = poss[0]
    max_p = poss[-1]
    num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
    if num_exp == k:
        c = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
        current = min_p
        while current <= max_p:
            out[current - 1] = c
            current += d
    return out
```
(This is useful for detecting and unifying sparse uniform patterns in mixed-color lines; it checks if placements exactly match an AP count, then overrides the span with the starting color—key for subtle uniform fills.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of GCD-based AP extensions and direction-based processing (horizontal for tall grids, vertical with per-color then mixed for wide grids).
 * The process_horizontal function worked well for uniform or endpoint-driven fills in rows, but may not be triggered in test (likely wide grid, so vertical path used).
 * Per_color_extension successfully built independent patterns in training vertical cases without conflicts.
 * Mixed_override_line correctly unified sparse cases in training, but in test, it may not have triggered enough due to post-per-color state not matching num_exp == k condition precisely.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level structures attempted; the code focuses on line-by-line processing, which aligns with puzzle but misses potential grid-wide pattern interactions (e.g., if patterns align across lines).
 * No unhelpful functions introduced; all provided (compute_gcd, process_horizontal, per_color_extension, mixed_override_line) are relevant, though process_horizontal's "else" branch (filling with max color) might over-simplify mixed horizontal cases compared to vertical's per-color approach.
 * Overall, core AP/GCD logic is strong, but vertical mixed override may need refinement for partial fills or interleaved colors after per-color step.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal filling: e.g., row 2 has 7 at column 10, 2s at 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at 7, 5s at 20-21; row 4 has 6 at 4, 5 at 20, 2 at 21; row 6 has 1 at 14, 6s at 16 and 21; row 8 has 2 at 18, 8 at 21; row 9 has 4 at 8, 7s at 19 and 21—mostly preserving input placements with little extension (many rows/columns remain all zeros).
 * This does not look correct; expected output should have more extensive fillings based on AP extensions (e.g., if test grid has vertical patterns like color 2 in column 21 across rows 2,4,?, it should fill gaps with step d from GCD), but output lacks such completions, suggesting per_color_extension or mixed_override didn't propagate far enough (possibly due to insufficient placements per color to trigger GCD>1, or override not activating on post-per-color state).
 * Zeros dominate (e.g., entire row 1 and 5,7), indicating no horizontal processing (consistent with wide grid assumption) and incomplete vertical extensions; for instance, column 21 has multiple 2/5/6/8/7 but no apparent filling between them, differing from expected unified AP if they share a residue.
 * The output makes partial sense for preserving input but fails to demonstrate full pattern extension, likely missing subtle rule for extending beyond min-max in per-color if AP is global, or handling colors with only one placement (which skips but might need propagation from adjacent lines—though puzzle seems line-independent).

[2025-10-03 03:44:43] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-completion puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with 0s as empty cells and positive integers as colors) must be filled by detecting and extending arithmetic progression patterns of the same color in rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical), using the GCD of position differences to determine the period and fill matching positions. The approach switches between row-wise and column-wise processing based on grid dimensions (taller grids prioritize horizontal, wider prioritize vertical), and handles both uniform-color patterns and mixed overrides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on 1-indexed positions; only consider non-zero cells for computing differences and GCD, and fill only empty (0) cells or reinforce existing matches without overwriting mismatches.
 * For uniform colors in a row/column, compute GCD of sorted position differences, then fill every position congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, extending beyond observed positions if possible.
 * For mixed colors, first group by color and apply per-color filling (without overriding existing different colors), then optionally override sparse mixed patterns by filling with the color at the minimum position if the observed points exactly match the expected count for the span.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > columns, prioritize horizontal completion; else, do vertical per-color then mixed override— this prevents overfilling in non-dominant directions.
 * Subtlety: In mixed vertical cases, the override only applies if the number of observed points equals the expected in the arithmetic sequence span, to avoid hallucinating dense patterns; also, filling stops at grid bounds.
 * Easy to miss: GCD computation ignores empty lists (defaults to 1, but skips if <2 points); per-color vertical filling allows reinforcing but not overwriting conflicting colors; horizontal assumes all same color for full periodic fill, but vertical mixed uses min-color override only under strict conditions.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), considerations include deep-copying grids to avoid mutation, sorting positions, and handling edge cases like single points (skip) or full spans.
 * Potential overreach: The mixed override might incorrectly fill if GCD leads to exact match count but wrong color propagation; test grids may have overlapping row/column constraints that require sequential application without conflicts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD of differences; essential for period detection and used in all pattern extensions.)

```python
def horizontal_completion(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for i in range(num_rows):
        row = grid[i]
        pos_color = [(j + 1, row[j]) for j in range(num_cols) if row[j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        all_same = all(c == colors[0] for c in colors)
        if all_same:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            r = poss[0] % d
            c = colors[0]
            for jj in range(1, num_cols + 1):
                if jj % d == r:
                    row[jj - 1] = c
        else:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            min_p = poss[0]
            max_p = poss[-1]
            color_max = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == max_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                row[current - 1][j] = color_max  # Note: Bug here, should be row[current - 1] = color_max? Wait, no, this is horizontal but code has row[jj-1], but in else it's incomplete.
    return grid
```
(This function works for uniform horizontal but has a bug in the mixed else branch: it sets row[current - 1][j] which assumes vertical indexing; it's unhelpful as-is for mixed horizontal and should be avoided or fixed. The uniform part is helpful.)

```python
def vertical_per_color_same(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):
        col_pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(col_pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        col_colors = set(c for _, c in col_pos_color)
        for cc in col_colors:
            group_pos = sorted(p for p, c in col_pos_color if c == cc)
            group_k = len(group_pos)
            if group_k < 2:
                continue
            group_diffs = [group_pos[m + 1] - group_pos[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
            group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
            group_r = group_pos[0] % group_d
            for ii in range(1, num_rows + 1):
                if ii % group_d == group_r:
                    if grid[ii - 1][j] == 0 or grid[ii - 1][j] == cc:
                        grid[ii - 1][j] = cc
    return grid
```
(This is helpful for per-color vertical filling without conflicts; key for mixed columns where colors are grouped separately.)

```python
def vertical_mixed_override(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):

        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        colors_set = set(colors)
        if len(colors_set) <= 1:
            continue
        diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
        d = compute_gcd(diffs)
        min_p = poss[0]
        max_p = poss[-1]
        num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
        if num_exp == k:
            color_min = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                grid[current - 1][j] = color_min
    return grid
```
(This is conditionally helpful for overriding mixed verticals under exact-span conditions, but may overfill if not all points are intended; useful for sparse tests but risky.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly handles training examples 1-3 by applying orientation-based processing and GCD patterns.
 * Missed full horizontal mixed handling: the else branch in horizontal_completion has a indexing bug (uses [j] but j undefined, likely copy-paste error from vertical), leading to no-op or crash in mixed rows.
 * Vertical mixed override uses min-color fill, but in some cases (e.g., test) it might need max or average; unknown why it underfills test.
 * Per-color vertical is essential for avoiding color conflicts in mixed columns, and it worked for training.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components); this puzzle is purely positional arithmetic, not blob-based, so object extraction would be unhelpful or broken.
 * Training successes suggest core GCD and uniform filling works, but test failure indicates subtlety in mixed or orientation for irregular grids.
 * The program function's orientation switch (rows > cols for horizontal) is key but may fail if test grid is square-ish or has cross-patterns needing both directions iteratively.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 21-column grid (inferred from row lengths) that remains extremely sparse, with only scattered numbers like 7s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 1s, 8s, 4s in positions matching the input (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 10, 2 at col 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at col 7, 5s at 20-21), and vast zeros elsewhere—no evident filling occurred beyond input.
 * This does not look correct: Expected output should show periodic extensions, e.g., the two 2s in row 2 (positions ~18 and 21, diff 3) might GCD to 3 and fill every 3rd position with 2 horizontally, but nothing is added; similarly, vertical 5s in col 20 (rows 3-4) should extend downward if uniform, but no change.
 * Underfilling suggests the program skipped most cases: likely because test grid has few lines with >=2 same-color points (many singles or mixed without exact span), and the horizontal mixed bug prevented any row fills; vertical per-color/mixed only touched columns with multiples but didn't propagate due to short spans or conflicts.
 * Differences from expected: No arithmetic fills visible (e.g., col 21 has 2,5,2,?,6,? which mixes colors without GCD match, so skipped correctly? But test likely needs more aggressive extension); output matches input almost exactly, implying no meaningful completion—probably wrong as puzzles expect denser grids.
 * To handle test, need bug fix in horizontal mixed, perhaps iterative row-col passes, or looser override conditions (e.g., fill if num_exp >= k).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or values) where the goal is to complete partially filled rows and columns by extending patterns, primarily arithmetic progressions of non-zero values into zero positions, with different handling for horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) directions based on grid dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify non-zero positions (S) in a line (row or column); if fewer than 2, no filling occurs.
 * For perfect arithmetic progressions (all differences equal), extend forward and backward from the starting position using the common difference d, overwriting zeros but not existing values (in vertical case, it checks if out[pos] == 0).
 * If not a perfect AP in horizontal (non-vertical), compute GCD of all differences and fill every GCD steps from start to end using the last non-zero value c.
 * In vertical (columns), handle per color separately: for each color's positions, check if they form a perfect AP and extend only into zeros if it's a perfect AP for that color.
 * Grid orientation matters: if more rows than columns, process rows horizontally; else, process columns vertically and reconstruct the grid.
 * Subtlety: Vertical processing groups by color and only extends perfect APs per color, avoiding overwriting; horizontal non-AP uses GCD filling with last value, which may not align with per-color logic.
 * Easy to miss: No filling if single non-zero or no pattern; GCD filling is only for horizontal non-AP and uses last value, not first or average; vertical doesn't use GCD, sticking to per-color perfect APs.
 * Considerations: Potential overwriting issues (code avoids in vertical but not explicitly in horizontal AP); assumes grid is rectangular; numbers are colors, so same number = same pattern group.

```
(Note: These are the core functions from the attempt; they handle line processing and grid orientation. No additional types like classes were used, but List[List[int]] for grid is implicit.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1, 2, and 3, demonstrating understanding of AP extension in both directions and GCD-based filling for horizontal non-AP cases.
 * Worked well for perfect APs by extending with constant value from start position.
 * Vertical per-color AP detection and zero-only filling avoided conflicts effectively in training cases.
 * Did not work fully for the test input: generated output shows heavy filling of 5's in what appears to be column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 have 5 in position 19, and some extras like row 2 has two 5's, row 3 has 5 and 2), but leaves most of the grid as zeros, suggesting incomplete pattern detection (e.g., no horizontal fillings observed, and vertical fillings seem biased toward 5's without addressing other colors like 7,2,6, etc., properly).
 * GCD filling in horizontal non-AP is limited to range S[0] to S[-1] and uses last value, which may miss extensions beyond the observed non-zeros or use wrong color in multi-color lines.
 * Vertical processing only extends perfect APs per color but ignores non-AP colors entirely, potentially missing GCD-like logic for vertical non-AP (asymmetry with horizontal).
 * No extraction functions for objects like "blobs" or connected components were used or needed; the line-based approach fits the pattern-extension puzzle but may overlook diagonal or multi-line interactions.
 * Function process_line is helpful and core to the solution, correctly copying existing non-zeros to output.
 * Overall, demonstrates core AP and GCD understanding but incomplete for test due to unhandled cases like mixed colors in vertical or non-extending beyond bounds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 9x21 grid (incomplete last row), with most positions still 0, but noticeable vertical fillings of 5's in column 19 across rows 0-8 (e.g., [...,5] in row 0, [...,5,2] in row 1, [...,5,5] in row 2, etc.), and some extras like 2 in row 1 col 20, 5 in row 3 col 20? Wait, formatting suggests column 19 is mostly 5's, column 20 has mixed 0,2,5,2,0,6,0,8,7.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely fill more patterns, such as horizontal APs (e.g., the 5's in column 19 suggest a vertical AP of 5's every 1 row, but code's vertical processing should catch that if perfect AP; however, other elements like the 7 in row 1 col 9, 9 in row 2 col 6, 6 in row 3 col 3, etc., seem unextended, leaving isolated non-zeros without filling nearby zeros).
 * Missing horizontal extensions entirely (e.g., row 6 has 1 at col 13 and 6 at col 15, diff=2, but no filling shown; if AP, should extend).
 * Bias toward filling 5's suggests the per-color vertical logic caught a strong AP for 5 (positions in col 19? Wait, no—the input isn't shown, but output implies input had 5's in col 19 at intervals, extended fully), but ignored or failed on other colors like 2 (appears in row 1 col 17 and 20, row 3 col 20, row 7 col 17, row 8 col 18? Not extended consistently).
 * Looks incomplete because ~90% zeros remain, whereas expected should propagate patterns more aggressively (e.g., if vertical since 9 rows < 21 cols? Code would process columns vertically, but output shows uneven filling, possibly missing GCD for non-AP columns).
 * Subtle difference: In row 8, ends with 5,7—may have partially filled a pattern, but unclear if correct without input; overall, does not match a "completed" puzzle grid, as patterns like the diagonal-ish 2's or scattered numbers aren't resolved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a sparse grid of numbered cells (representing colors) where the task is to fill in the blank cells (0s) by extending arithmetic progression patterns either horizontally across rows or vertically down columns, determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of position differences for placed colors. The direction of processing (horizontal if more rows than columns, vertical otherwise) suggests the puzzle adapts to grid aspect ratio, with rules prioritizing uniform color extensions, per-color independent fillings, and overrides for mixed-color cases to avoid conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on positions (1-indexed) of non-zero cells; compute differences between consecutive positions of the same color (or all positions if uniform), then use GCD as the step size (d) to extend fillings starting from the first position's residue (r = pos[0] % d).
 * For uniform colors in a line (row or column), fill every d steps across the entire length if the pattern is consistent; for mixed colors, limit filling to the span between min and max positions to avoid over-extension.
 * Per-color processing is crucial for vertical cases: treat each color independently to extend its own AP without interfering with others initially, only overriding zeros or matching cells.
 * Mixed-color overrides should check if the number of expected positions in the AP equals the number of actual placements (indicating a sparse uniform fill disguised as mixed), then fill the span with the starting color; this handles cases where multiple colors appear but follow a single underlying pattern.
 * Direction decision (horizontal if num_rows > num_cols, else vertical) is key, but vertical processing requires two passes: per-color extension first (to build independent patterns), then mixed override (to unify sparse cases).
 * Subtle edge cases: single or zero placements do nothing; GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1 (but skipped); avoid overwriting existing non-matching cells in per-color extensions; positions must be sorted for diff calculation.
 * Grid is list of lists, output must be deep copy to avoid mutating input; assume rectangular grid with consistent lengths.
 * Potential for conflicts in vertical mixed cases: if after per-color, a column has interleaved colors, the mixed override may not trigger correctly if num_exp != k due to partial fills.

from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD computation on position differences; reliable and handles empty lists gracefully.)

```python
def per_color_extension(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:

        if c != 0:
            if c not in pos_by_color:
                pos_by_color[c] = []
            pos_by_color[c].append(i + 1)
    for cc, group_poss in pos_by_color.items():
        group_k = len(group_poss)
        if group_k < 2:
            continue
        group_poss = sorted(group_poss)
        group_diffs = [group_poss[m + 1] - group_poss[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
        group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
        group_r = group_poss[0] % group_d
        for p in range(1, length + 1):
            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == cc:
                    out[p - 1] = cc
    return out
```
(This function is helpful for independent color extensions in vertical processing; it groups positions by color, computes per-color GCD/AP, and fills safely without overwriting mismatches—essential for handling multi-color columns.)

```python
def mixed_override_line(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_color = [(i + 1, line[i]) for i in range(length) if line[i] != 0]
    k = len(pos_color)
    if k < 2:
        return out
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
    colors_set = set(colors)
    if len(colors_set) <= 1:
        return out
    diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    min_p = poss[0]
    max_p = poss[-1]
    num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
    if num_exp == k:
        c = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
        current = min_p
        while current <= max_p:
            out[current - 1] = c
            current += d
    return out
```
(This is useful for detecting and unifying sparse uniform patterns in mixed-color lines; it checks if placements exactly match an AP count, then overrides the span with the starting color—key for subtle uniform fills.)

 * This attempt correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of GCD-based AP extensions and direction-based processing (horizontal for tall grids, vertical with per-color then mixed for wide grids).
 * The process_horizontal function worked well for uniform or endpoint-driven fills in rows, but may not be triggered in test (likely wide grid, so vertical path used).
 * Per_color_extension successfully built independent patterns in training vertical cases without conflicts.
 * Mixed_override_line correctly unified sparse cases in training, but in test, it may not have triggered enough due to post-per-color state not matching num_exp == k condition precisely.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level structures attempted; the code focuses on line-by-line processing, which aligns with puzzle but misses potential grid-wide pattern interactions (e.g., if patterns align across lines).
 * No unhelpful functions introduced; all provided (compute_gcd, process_horizontal, per_color_extension, mixed_override_line) are relevant, though process_horizontal's "else" branch (filling with max color) might over-simplify mixed horizontal cases compared to vertical's per-color approach.
 * Overall, core AP/GCD logic is strong, but vertical mixed override may need refinement for partial fills or interleaved colors after per-color step.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal filling: e.g., row 2 has 7 at column 10, 2s at 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at 7, 5s at 20-21; row 4 has 6 at 4, 5 at 20, 2 at 21; row 6 has 1 at 14, 6s at 16 and 21; row 8 has 2 at 18, 8 at 21; row 9 has 4 at 8, 7s at 19 and 21—mostly preserving input placements with little extension (many rows/columns remain all zeros).
 * This does not look correct; expected output should have more extensive fillings based on AP extensions (e.g., if test grid has vertical patterns like color 2 in column 21 across rows 2,4,?, it should fill gaps with step d from GCD), but output lacks such completions, suggesting per_color_extension or mixed_override didn't propagate far enough (possibly due to insufficient placements per color to trigger GCD>1, or override not activating on post-per-color state).
 * Zeros dominate (e.g., entire row 1 and 5,7), indicating no horizontal processing (consistent with wide grid assumption) and incomplete vertical extensions; for instance, column 21 has multiple 2/5/6/8/7 but no apparent filling between them, differing from expected unified AP if they share a residue.
 * The output makes partial sense for preserving input but fails to demonstrate full pattern extension, likely missing subtle rule for extending beyond min-max in per-color if AP is global, or handling colors with only one placement (which skips but might need propagation from adjacent lines—though puzzle seems line-independent).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 03:51:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a partially filled grid where numbers represent colors, and the goal is to extend patterns in rows or columns based on arithmetic progressions derived from the positions of existing colors, using GCD to determine periodicity and fill zeros accordingly, while handling uniform vs. mixed color cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extended either horizontally (per row) or vertically (per column), decided by comparing num_rows > num_cols; this orientation choice is crucial and may need flexibility if the grid is square.
 * For uniform colors in a line, compute GCD of position differences, then fill all positions congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, potentially across the entire line.
 * For mixed colors, handle per-color extensions (extending each color's own progression independently, overwriting zeros or matching values) before attempting overrides; overrides only apply if the number of expected positions matches the given ones exactly, using the starting color to fill the progression.
 * Subtlety: Positions are 1-indexed in calculations (e.g., i+1), and extensions stop at the line length; avoid overwriting existing non-matching colors in per-color extensions.
 * Key: If fewer than 2 positions per color/group, no extension; empty lines or singletons remain unchanged.
 * Consideration: GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1, but lines with no colors stay all zeros; mixed overrides only trigger for exact progression matches to avoid overfilling.
 * Easy to miss: In mixed horizontal extensions, it uses the last sorted color (potentially incorrect—should it be the first or majority?); column processing chains per-color then override, which may conflict in dense grids.
 * Overall: Prioritize uniform extensions; for mixed, per-color is safer than full overrides to prevent bleeding colors incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is useful for finding common differences in positions.)

```python
def is_uniform(pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not pos_color:
        return True
    c0 = pos_color[0][1]
    return all(c == c0 for _, c in pos_color)
```
(This checks if all given colors in positions are the same, key for deciding uniform vs. mixed handling.)

```python
def extend_uniform(line: List[int], pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    diffs = [poss[i + 1] - poss[i] for i in range(len(poss) - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    r = poss[0] % d
    c = pos_color[0][1]
    n = len(line)
    out = line[:]
    for p in range(1, n + 1):
        if p % d == r:
            out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This correctly extends a uniform color across the full line using modulo residue, a core mechanic.)

```python
def per_color_extension(line: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_by_color: dict[int, List[int]] = {}
    for i in range(n):
        c = line[i]
        if c != 0:
            if c not in pos_by_color:
                pos_by_color[c] = []
            pos_by_color[c].append(i + 1)
    for c, group_poss in pos_by_color.items():
        group_k = len(group_poss)
        if group_k < 2:
            continue
        group_poss = sorted(group_poss)
        group_diffs = [group_poss[m + 1] - group_poss[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
        group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
        group_r = group_poss[0] % group_d
        for p in range(1, n + 1):
            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == c:
                    out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This is essential for handling mixed colors by extending each independently without aggressive overwriting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) successfully passed all three training examples, indicating strong handling of uniform and basic mixed extensions in rows/columns.
 * Worked: GCD-based periodicity correctly extends uniforms across full lines; per-color extension avoids conflicts in mixed cases; orientation logic (rows if taller) works for training grids.
 * Did not work: In the test, many rows/columns remain mostly zeros (e.g., row 0 all zeros, row 4 all zeros), suggesting no extension triggered despite potential patterns—possibly due to <2 positions per group or mixed override failing when num_exp != k.
 * Problem understanding: The puzzle involves filling a sparse grid by extrapolating color progressions, but this attempt assumes full-line extensions for uniforms and cautious per-color for mixed; it may miss cases where mixed overrides should propagate a dominant color or where vertical processing needs row-wise checks first.
 * extract_objects not present or needed—no object extraction here; puzzle is line-based, not blob/object-oriented.
 * Function `extend_mixed_horizontal` is somewhat broken/not fully helpful: It always uses the last sorted color for filling, which ignores mixed nature and may overwrite incorrectly; only fills between min/max, not full line—use sparingly or fix to select starting color properly.
 * Function `mixed_override` is conditionally helpful but restrictive: Only fills if exact match on expected positions, leaving many zeros in test (e.g., row 1 has 7 at 10, 2s at 18/20—GCD=2? but no full extension); good for avoiding overfill but may underfill test cases with partial progressions.
 * process_row/process_column chain per-color then override, which worked for training but likely under-extends test columns (e.g., column 19 has 5,5,2 in rows 2-4, but no visible vertical fill).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it shows partial fills (e.g., row 1: isolated 7 at pos 10, 2s at 18/20 but no further extension like every 8? positions if GCD=8), leaving most of the 21x9? grid as zeros, which suggests under-extension compared to expected full pattern completion.
 * Row 0 all zeros: Expected some fill if input had implicit patterns or if orientation was wrong—output unchanged, indicating no positions triggered extension.
 * Row 2: 9 at pos7, 5s at 20/21—GCD=13? but no extension between/around; looks incorrect as it should fill progression if uniform/mixed per color.
 * Row 3: 6 at4, 5 at20, 2 at21—mixed, per-color should extend 6's singleton (none) and 5/2 (none since adjacent), but zeros dominate; different from expected by not filling any arithmetic sequence.
 * Vertical: e.g., column 20 has 2 (row1),5(row2),2(row3),6(row5)—mixed, but output shows no vertical fills, likely because num_rows=9 > num_cols=21? Wait, 9<21 so processes columns, but result has sparse fills only where input had them—underfilled, missing expected GCD extensions like for 2s or 5s.
 * Overall, test output is too sparse (mostly zeros, only input positions filled, no visible extensions beyond originals); expected denser grid with propagated colors (e.g., row 7: 2 at18,8 at21—no fill; row 8:4 at8,7 at19/21—should extend 7 every 2? but doesn't). This differs by lacking progression fills, possibly due to strict <2 or exact-match conditions blocking valid partial patterns.

[2025-10-03 03:51:59] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-completion puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with 0s as empty cells and positive integers as colors) must be filled by detecting and extending arithmetic progression patterns of the same color in rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical), using the GCD of position differences to determine the period and fill matching positions. The approach switches between row-wise and column-wise processing based on grid dimensions (taller grids prioritize horizontal, wider prioritize vertical), and handles both uniform-color patterns and mixed overrides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on 1-indexed positions; only consider non-zero cells for computing differences and GCD, and fill only empty (0) cells or reinforce existing matches without overwriting mismatches.
 * For uniform colors in a row/column, compute GCD of sorted position differences, then fill every position congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, extending beyond observed positions if possible.
 * For mixed colors, first group by color and apply per-color filling (without overriding existing different colors), then optionally override sparse mixed patterns by filling with the color at the minimum position if the observed points exactly match the expected count for the span.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > columns, prioritize horizontal completion; else, do vertical per-color then mixed override— this prevents overfilling in non-dominant directions.
 * Subtlety: In mixed vertical cases, the override only applies if the number of observed points equals the expected in the arithmetic sequence span, to avoid hallucinating dense patterns; also, filling stops at grid bounds.
 * Easy to miss: GCD computation ignores empty lists (defaults to 1, but skips if <2 points); per-color vertical filling allows reinforcing but not overwriting conflicting colors; horizontal assumes all same color for full periodic fill, but vertical mixed uses min-color override only under strict conditions.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), considerations include deep-copying grids to avoid mutation, sorting positions, and handling edge cases like single points (skip) or full spans.
 * Potential overreach: The mixed override might incorrectly fill if GCD leads to exact match count but wrong color propagation; test grids may have overlapping row/column constraints that require sequential application without conflicts.

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:

```
(This is a solid utility for GCD of differences; essential for period detection and used in all pattern extensions.)

```python
def horizontal_completion(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)

    for i in range(num_rows):
        row = grid[i]
        pos_color = [(j + 1, row[j]) for j in range(num_cols) if row[j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        all_same = all(c == colors[0] for c in colors)
        if all_same:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            r = poss[0] % d
            c = colors[0]
            for jj in range(1, num_cols + 1):
                if jj % d == r:
                    row[jj - 1] = c
        else:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            min_p = poss[0]
            max_p = poss[-1]
            color_max = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == max_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                row[current - 1][j] = color_max  # Note: Bug here, should be row[current - 1] = color_max? Wait, no, this is horizontal but code has row[jj-1], but in else it's incomplete.
    return grid
```
(This function works for uniform horizontal but has a bug in the mixed else branch: it sets row[current - 1][j] which assumes vertical indexing; it's unhelpful as-is for mixed horizontal and should be avoided or fixed. The uniform part is helpful.)

    for j in range(num_cols):
        col_pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(col_pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        col_colors = set(c for _, c in col_pos_color)
        for cc in col_colors:
            group_pos = sorted(p for p, c in col_pos_color if c == cc)
            group_k = len(group_pos)
            if group_k < 2:
                continue
            group_diffs = [group_pos[m + 1] - group_pos[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
            group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
            group_r = group_pos[0] % group_d
            for ii in range(1, num_rows + 1):
                if ii % group_d == group_r:
                    if grid[ii - 1][j] == 0 or grid[ii - 1][j] == cc:
                        grid[ii - 1][j] = cc
    return grid
```
(This is helpful for per-color vertical filling without conflicts; key for mixed columns where colors are grouped separately.)

```python
def vertical_mixed_override(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)

        if k < 2:
            continue

        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]

        if len(colors_set) <= 1:

        max_p = poss[-1]

            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:

    return grid
```
(This is conditionally helpful for overriding mixed verticals under exact-span conditions, but may overfill if not all points are intended; useful for sparse tests but risky.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly handles training examples 1-3 by applying orientation-based processing and GCD patterns.
 * Missed full horizontal mixed handling: the else branch in horizontal_completion has a indexing bug (uses [j] but j undefined, likely copy-paste error from vertical), leading to no-op or crash in mixed rows.
 * Vertical mixed override uses min-color fill, but in some cases (e.g., test) it might need max or average; unknown why it underfills test.
 * Per-color vertical is essential for avoiding color conflicts in mixed columns, and it worked for training.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components); this puzzle is purely positional arithmetic, not blob-based, so object extraction would be unhelpful or broken.
 * Training successes suggest core GCD and uniform filling works, but test failure indicates subtlety in mixed or orientation for irregular grids.
 * The program function's orientation switch (rows > cols for horizontal) is key but may fail if test grid is square-ish or has cross-patterns needing both directions iteratively.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 21-column grid (inferred from row lengths) that remains extremely sparse, with only scattered numbers like 7s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 1s, 8s, 4s in positions matching the input (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 10, 2 at col 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at col 7, 5s at 20-21), and vast zeros elsewhere—no evident filling occurred beyond input.
 * This does not look correct: Expected output should show periodic extensions, e.g., the two 2s in row 2 (positions ~18 and 21, diff 3) might GCD to 3 and fill every 3rd position with 2 horizontally, but nothing is added; similarly, vertical 5s in col 20 (rows 3-4) should extend downward if uniform, but no change.
 * Underfilling suggests the program skipped most cases: likely because test grid has few lines with >=2 same-color points (many singles or mixed without exact span), and the horizontal mixed bug prevented any row fills; vertical per-color/mixed only touched columns with multiples but didn't propagate due to short spans or conflicts.
 * Differences from expected: No arithmetic fills visible (e.g., col 21 has 2,5,2,?,6,? which mixes colors without GCD match, so skipped correctly? But test likely needs more aggressive extension); output matches input almost exactly, implying no meaningful completion—probably wrong as puzzles expect denser grids.
 * To handle test, need bug fix in horizontal mixed, perhaps iterative row-col passes, or looser override conditions (e.g., fill if num_exp >= k).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or values) where the goal is to complete partially filled rows and columns by extending patterns, primarily arithmetic progressions of non-zero values into zero positions, with different handling for horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) directions based on grid dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify non-zero positions (S) in a line (row or column); if fewer than 2, no filling occurs.
 * For perfect arithmetic progressions (all differences equal), extend forward and backward from the starting position using the common difference d, overwriting zeros but not existing values (in vertical case, it checks if out[pos] == 0).
 * If not a perfect AP in horizontal (non-vertical), compute GCD of all differences and fill every GCD steps from start to end using the last non-zero value c.
 * In vertical (columns), handle per color separately: for each color's positions, check if they form a perfect AP and extend only into zeros if it's a perfect AP for that color.
 * Grid orientation matters: if more rows than columns, process rows horizontally; else, process columns vertically and reconstruct the grid.
 * Subtlety: Vertical processing groups by color and only extends perfect APs per color, avoiding overwriting; horizontal non-AP uses GCD filling with last value, which may not align with per-color logic.
 * Easy to miss: No filling if single non-zero or no pattern; GCD filling is only for horizontal non-AP and uses last value, not first or average; vertical doesn't use GCD, sticking to per-color perfect APs.
 * Considerations: Potential overwriting issues (code avoids in vertical but not explicitly in horizontal AP); assumes grid is rectangular; numbers are colors, so same number = same pattern group.

```
(Note: These are the core functions from the attempt; they handle line processing and grid orientation. No additional types like classes were used, but List[List[int]] for grid is implicit.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1, 2, and 3, demonstrating understanding of AP extension in both directions and GCD-based filling for horizontal non-AP cases.
 * Worked well for perfect APs by extending with constant value from start position.
 * Vertical per-color AP detection and zero-only filling avoided conflicts effectively in training cases.
 * Did not work fully for the test input: generated output shows heavy filling of 5's in what appears to be column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 have 5 in position 19, and some extras like row 2 has two 5's, row 3 has 5 and 2), but leaves most of the grid as zeros, suggesting incomplete pattern detection (e.g., no horizontal fillings observed, and vertical fillings seem biased toward 5's without addressing other colors like 7,2,6, etc., properly).
 * GCD filling in horizontal non-AP is limited to range S[0] to S[-1] and uses last value, which may miss extensions beyond the observed non-zeros or use wrong color in multi-color lines.
 * Vertical processing only extends perfect APs per color but ignores non-AP colors entirely, potentially missing GCD-like logic for vertical non-AP (asymmetry with horizontal).
 * No extraction functions for objects like "blobs" or connected components were used or needed; the line-based approach fits the pattern-extension puzzle but may overlook diagonal or multi-line interactions.
 * Function process_line is helpful and core to the solution, correctly copying existing non-zeros to output.
 * Overall, demonstrates core AP and GCD understanding but incomplete for test due to unhandled cases like mixed colors in vertical or non-extending beyond bounds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 9x21 grid (incomplete last row), with most positions still 0, but noticeable vertical fillings of 5's in column 19 across rows 0-8 (e.g., [...,5] in row 0, [...,5,2] in row 1, [...,5,5] in row 2, etc.), and some extras like 2 in row 1 col 20, 5 in row 3 col 20? Wait, formatting suggests column 19 is mostly 5's, column 20 has mixed 0,2,5,2,0,6,0,8,7.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely fill more patterns, such as horizontal APs (e.g., the 5's in column 19 suggest a vertical AP of 5's every 1 row, but code's vertical processing should catch that if perfect AP; however, other elements like the 7 in row 1 col 9, 9 in row 2 col 6, 6 in row 3 col 3, etc., seem unextended, leaving isolated non-zeros without filling nearby zeros).
 * Missing horizontal extensions entirely (e.g., row 6 has 1 at col 13 and 6 at col 15, diff=2, but no filling shown; if AP, should extend).
 * Bias toward filling 5's suggests the per-color vertical logic caught a strong AP for 5 (positions in col 19? Wait, no—the input isn't shown, but output implies input had 5's in col 19 at intervals, extended fully), but ignored or failed on other colors like 2 (appears in row 1 col 17 and 20, row 3 col 20, row 7 col 17, row 8 col 18? Not extended consistently).
 * Looks incomplete because ~90% zeros remain, whereas expected should propagate patterns more aggressively (e.g., if vertical since 9 rows < 21 cols? Code would process columns vertically, but output shows uneven filling, possibly missing GCD for non-AP columns).
 * Subtle difference: In row 8, ends with 5,7—may have partially filled a pattern, but unclear if correct without input; overall, does not match a "completed" puzzle grid, as patterns like the diagonal-ish 2's or scattered numbers aren't resolved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a sparse grid of numbered cells (representing colors) where the task is to fill in the blank cells (0s) by extending arithmetic progression patterns either horizontally across rows or vertically down columns, determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of position differences for placed colors. The direction of processing (horizontal if more rows than columns, vertical otherwise) suggests the puzzle adapts to grid aspect ratio, with rules prioritizing uniform color extensions, per-color independent fillings, and overrides for mixed-color cases to avoid conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on positions (1-indexed) of non-zero cells; compute differences between consecutive positions of the same color (or all positions if uniform), then use GCD as the step size (d) to extend fillings starting from the first position's residue (r = pos[0] % d).
 * For uniform colors in a line (row or column), fill every d steps across the entire length if the pattern is consistent; for mixed colors, limit filling to the span between min and max positions to avoid over-extension.
 * Per-color processing is crucial for vertical cases: treat each color independently to extend its own AP without interfering with others initially, only overriding zeros or matching cells.
 * Mixed-color overrides should check if the number of expected positions in the AP equals the number of actual placements (indicating a sparse uniform fill disguised as mixed), then fill the span with the starting color; this handles cases where multiple colors appear but follow a single underlying pattern.
 * Direction decision (horizontal if num_rows > num_cols, else vertical) is key, but vertical processing requires two passes: per-color extension first (to build independent patterns), then mixed override (to unify sparse cases).
 * Subtle edge cases: single or zero placements do nothing; GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1 (but skipped); avoid overwriting existing non-matching cells in per-color extensions; positions must be sorted for diff calculation.
 * Grid is list of lists, output must be deep copy to avoid mutating input; assume rectangular grid with consistent lengths.
 * Potential for conflicts in vertical mixed cases: if after per-color, a column has interleaved colors, the mixed override may not trigger correctly if num_exp != k due to partial fills.

            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == cc:
                    out[p - 1] = cc
    return out
```
(This function is helpful for independent color extensions in vertical processing; it groups positions by color, computes per-color GCD/AP, and fills safely without overwriting mismatches—essential for handling multi-color columns.)

```python
def mixed_override_line(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_color = [(i + 1, line[i]) for i in range(length) if line[i] != 0]
    k = len(pos_color)
    if k < 2:
        return out
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
    colors_set = set(colors)
    if len(colors_set) <= 1:
        return out
    diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    min_p = poss[0]
    max_p = poss[-1]
    num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
    if num_exp == k:
        c = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
        current = min_p
        while current <= max_p:
            out[current - 1] = c
            current += d
    return out
```
(This is useful for detecting and unifying sparse uniform patterns in mixed-color lines; it checks if placements exactly match an AP count, then overrides the span with the starting color—key for subtle uniform fills.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of GCD-based AP extensions and direction-based processing (horizontal for tall grids, vertical with per-color then mixed for wide grids).
 * The process_horizontal function worked well for uniform or endpoint-driven fills in rows, but may not be triggered in test (likely wide grid, so vertical path used).
 * Per_color_extension successfully built independent patterns in training vertical cases without conflicts.
 * Mixed_override_line correctly unified sparse cases in training, but in test, it may not have triggered enough due to post-per-color state not matching num_exp == k condition precisely.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level structures attempted; the code focuses on line-by-line processing, which aligns with puzzle but misses potential grid-wide pattern interactions (e.g., if patterns align across lines).
 * No unhelpful functions introduced; all provided (compute_gcd, process_horizontal, per_color_extension, mixed_override_line) are relevant, though process_horizontal's "else" branch (filling with max color) might over-simplify mixed horizontal cases compared to vertical's per-color approach.
 * Overall, core AP/GCD logic is strong, but vertical mixed override may need refinement for partial fills or interleaved colors after per-color step.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal filling: e.g., row 2 has 7 at column 10, 2s at 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at 7, 5s at 20-21; row 4 has 6 at 4, 5 at 20, 2 at 21; row 6 has 1 at 14, 6s at 16 and 21; row 8 has 2 at 18, 8 at 21; row 9 has 4 at 8, 7s at 19 and 21—mostly preserving input placements with little extension (many rows/columns remain all zeros).
 * This does not look correct; expected output should have more extensive fillings based on AP extensions (e.g., if test grid has vertical patterns like color 2 in column 21 across rows 2,4,?, it should fill gaps with step d from GCD), but output lacks such completions, suggesting per_color_extension or mixed_override didn't propagate far enough (possibly due to insufficient placements per color to trigger GCD>1, or override not activating on post-per-color state).
 * Zeros dominate (e.g., entire row 1 and 5,7), indicating no horizontal processing (consistent with wide grid assumption) and incomplete vertical extensions; for instance, column 21 has multiple 2/5/6/8/7 but no apparent filling between them, differing from expected unified AP if they share a residue.
 * The output makes partial sense for preserving input but fails to demonstrate full pattern extension, likely missing subtle rule for extending beyond min-max in per-color if AP is global, or handling colors with only one placement (which skips but might need propagation from adjacent lines—though puzzle seems line-independent).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a partially filled grid where numbers represent colors, and the goal is to extend patterns in rows or columns based on arithmetic progressions derived from the positions of existing colors, using GCD to determine periodicity and fill zeros accordingly, while handling uniform vs. mixed color cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extended either horizontally (per row) or vertically (per column), decided by comparing num_rows > num_cols; this orientation choice is crucial and may need flexibility if the grid is square.
 * For uniform colors in a line, compute GCD of position differences, then fill all positions congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, potentially across the entire line.
 * For mixed colors, handle per-color extensions (extending each color's own progression independently, overwriting zeros or matching values) before attempting overrides; overrides only apply if the number of expected positions matches the given ones exactly, using the starting color to fill the progression.
 * Subtlety: Positions are 1-indexed in calculations (e.g., i+1), and extensions stop at the line length; avoid overwriting existing non-matching colors in per-color extensions.
 * Key: If fewer than 2 positions per color/group, no extension; empty lines or singletons remain unchanged.
 * Consideration: GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1, but lines with no colors stay all zeros; mixed overrides only trigger for exact progression matches to avoid overfilling.
 * Easy to miss: In mixed horizontal extensions, it uses the last sorted color (potentially incorrect—should it be the first or majority?); column processing chains per-color then override, which may conflict in dense grids.
 * Overall: Prioritize uniform extensions; for mixed, per-color is safer than full overrides to prevent bleeding colors incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is useful for finding common differences in positions.)

```python
def is_uniform(pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not pos_color:
        return True
    c0 = pos_color[0][1]
    return all(c == c0 for _, c in pos_color)
```
(This checks if all given colors in positions are the same, key for deciding uniform vs. mixed handling.)

```python
def extend_uniform(line: List[int], pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    diffs = [poss[i + 1] - poss[i] for i in range(len(poss) - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    r = poss[0] % d
    c = pos_color[0][1]
    n = len(line)
    out = line[:]
    for p in range(1, n + 1):
        if p % d == r:
            out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This correctly extends a uniform color across the full line using modulo residue, a core mechanic.)

```python
def per_color_extension(line: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_by_color: dict[int, List[int]] = {}
    for i in range(n):
        c = line[i]
        if c != 0:
            if c not in pos_by_color:
                pos_by_color[c] = []
            pos_by_color[c].append(i + 1)
    for c, group_poss in pos_by_color.items():
        group_k = len(group_poss)
        if group_k < 2:
            continue
        group_poss = sorted(group_poss)
        group_diffs = [group_poss[m + 1] - group_poss[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
        group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
        group_r = group_poss[0] % group_d
        for p in range(1, n + 1):
            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == c:
                    out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This is essential for handling mixed colors by extending each independently without aggressive overwriting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) successfully passed all three training examples, indicating strong handling of uniform and basic mixed extensions in rows/columns.
 * Worked: GCD-based periodicity correctly extends uniforms across full lines; per-color extension avoids conflicts in mixed cases; orientation logic (rows if taller) works for training grids.
 * Did not work: In the test, many rows/columns remain mostly zeros (e.g., row 0 all zeros, row 4 all zeros), suggesting no extension triggered despite potential patterns—possibly due to <2 positions per group or mixed override failing when num_exp != k.
 * Problem understanding: The puzzle involves filling a sparse grid by extrapolating color progressions, but this attempt assumes full-line extensions for uniforms and cautious per-color for mixed; it may miss cases where mixed overrides should propagate a dominant color or where vertical processing needs row-wise checks first.
 * extract_objects not present or needed—no object extraction here; puzzle is line-based, not blob/object-oriented.
 * Function `extend_mixed_horizontal` is somewhat broken/not fully helpful: It always uses the last sorted color for filling, which ignores mixed nature and may overwrite incorrectly; only fills between min/max, not full line—use sparingly or fix to select starting color properly.
 * Function `mixed_override` is conditionally helpful but restrictive: Only fills if exact match on expected positions, leaving many zeros in test (e.g., row 1 has 7 at 10, 2s at 18/20—GCD=2? but no full extension); good for avoiding overfill but may underfill test cases with partial progressions.
 * process_row/process_column chain per-color then override, which worked for training but likely under-extends test columns (e.g., column 19 has 5,5,2 in rows 2-4, but no visible vertical fill).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it shows partial fills (e.g., row 1: isolated 7 at pos 10, 2s at 18/20 but no further extension like every 8? positions if GCD=8), leaving most of the 21x9? grid as zeros, which suggests under-extension compared to expected full pattern completion.
 * Row 0 all zeros: Expected some fill if input had implicit patterns or if orientation was wrong—output unchanged, indicating no positions triggered extension.
 * Row 2: 9 at pos7, 5s at 20/21—GCD=13? but no extension between/around; looks incorrect as it should fill progression if uniform/mixed per color.
 * Row 3: 6 at4, 5 at20, 2 at21—mixed, per-color should extend 6's singleton (none) and 5/2 (none since adjacent), but zeros dominate; different from expected by not filling any arithmetic sequence.
 * Vertical: e.g., column 20 has 2 (row1),5(row2),2(row3),6(row5)—mixed, but output shows no vertical fills, likely because num_rows=9 > num_cols=21? Wait, 9<21 so processes columns, but result has sparse fills only where input had them—underfilled, missing expected GCD extensions like for 2s or 5s.
 * Overall, test output is too sparse (mostly zeros, only input positions filled, no visible extensions beyond originals); expected denser grid with propagated colors (e.g., row 7: 2 at18,8 at21—no fill; row 8:4 at8,7 at19/21—should extend 7 every 2? but doesn't). This differs by lacking progression fills, possibly due to strict <2 or exact-match conditions blocking valid partial patterns.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 04:05:33] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to extend or complete patterns in rows and columns of a numerical grid (likely representing colors or values) based on detected arithmetic progressions, common differences, or GCD-based spacing, prioritizing horizontal fills in wider grids and vertical in taller ones, while handling multiple "colors" separately in vertical processing to avoid overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are only extended if there are at least two non-zero values in a line to establish a difference (arithmetic progression check fails for single points or no points).
 * For horizontal (non-vertical) processing, if not a perfect AP, fall back to GCD of differences to fill from start to end with the last value's color, but only within the span of existing points—do not extrapolate beyond.
 * Vertical processing handles per-color APs separately, filling empty spots without overwriting existing values, and extends both forward and backward, but only if a perfect AP is detected per color.
 * Grid orientation matters: process rows if more rows than columns (tall grid), columns if more columns than rows (wide grid)—this avoids redundant processing.
 * Subtlety: Extensions in vertical mode check for empty (0) spots only when filling to avoid conflicts, but horizontal GCD mode unconditionally fills within span, potentially overwriting (though input likely has no conflicts).
 * Easy to miss: GCD fallback is horizontal-only and uses the last value's color, not the first; vertical per-color filling can create overlapping patterns but respects existing values.
 * No diagonal or multi-line interactions; purely per-row or per-column.
 * Zeros are placeholders to fill; non-zeros are fixed clues.
 * Potential edge cases: All zeros (no fill), single non-zero (no extension), irregular spacing (GCD approximates), multiple colors in one line (vertical splits them).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict
from math import gcd

def process_line(line: List[int], n: int, is_vertical: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-zero positions S, checks for perfect AP with common diff d.
    # If AP: extends forward/backward from first position using d and first value c.
    # Non-AP horizontal: computes GCD of diffs, fills from first to last pos with last value c using GCD step.
    # Vertical non-AP: groups by color, checks AP per color, extends per color without overwriting.
    # Returns filled line with zeros replaced where patterns match.
    out = [0] * n
    # ... (full implementation as in the provided program)
    return out
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Determines orientation: rows if tall, columns if wide.
    # Applies process_line to each row or extracted column.
    # Reconstructs output grid.
    # Handles empty grid edge case.
    # ... (full implementation as in the provided program)
    return out_g  # or processed rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly extending APs and GCD patterns without overfills or misses.
 * The attempt demonstrates understanding of orientation-based processing (rows vs. columns) and per-color handling in vertical mode, which likely passed trainings by filling sparse patterns accurately.
 * However, the GCD fallback in horizontal mode is limited to the span of existing points (S[0] to S[-1]), which might miss full-line extensions if the puzzle expects extrapolation beyond clues.
 * Vertical mode's per-color AP is helpful but only activates if perfect AP per color; irregular multi-color lines may leave zeros unfilled.
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components or blobs) is present, but it's not needed—line-based processing suffices; adding blob detection would be unhelpful and overcomplicate.
 * The `process_line` function is core and helpful, correctly isolating non-zeros and diffs; retain and refine it.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; the gcd import and Dict for pos_by_color are relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid but leaves many zeros, with extensions like repeated 5's in column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 all get 5? Wait, shown lines suggest vertical fills for 5's in col 19/20, but inconsistent: line 0 has 5 at pos19, line1 has 5 at20 and2 at20? Output shows incomplete patterns.
 * It does not look fully correct: For example, in row 1 (second line), there's a 7 at pos9, 2 at17, 5 at19,2 at20— if horizontal processing, GCD of diffs might not fill between them properly, leaving zeros; vertical for col9 should extend the 7 if AP, but output shows only isolated 7s without clear extension (e.g., row2 col6 has9, not related).
 * Observed effects: Heavy filling of 5's in later columns (e.g., col19/20 across rows), likely from vertical AP detection for color5, but misses horizontal patterns like potential AP in row5 (1 at13,6 at15—diff2, could extend but doesn't). Also, row7 has2 at17,8 at20, but no fill between. Differs from expected by under-filling horizontals (e.g., row3:6 at3, then zeros until5 at19—GCD fallback should fill some but span-limited). Row8:4 at7,7 at18,5 at19,7 at20—multi-color, vertical might split but output shows no extensions. Unknown why some isolates like row2's9 at6 aren't extended, possibly no AP partner.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (some vertical 5-chains look extended correctly) but is incomplete, missing horizontal GCD fills and potential bi-directional extensions beyond spans, suggesting the program under-extends in non-perfect AP cases.

[2025-10-03 04:05:53] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in *every* train example (or do not contradict any example where the relevant elements are present). I focused only on properties like color, position (x/y from bbox), pixel count, and shape type (single vs. multi-pixel bar, determined by bbox span and pixels). No assumptions about semantic meaning, grid size, or overall puzzle logic were made. Interactions not present or inconsistent across all trains (e.g., specific fill patterns like "even columns only") are excluded. Where an exact mechanism cannot be explained without forcing a non-obvious connection, it is noted as unknown. Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, holes=0 everywhere with no variation or effect) are omitted. No high-level solution or total understanding is provided.

1. **Position (y-coordinate/row) → Grouping for Horizontal Interaction**  
   - Shapes sharing the same y (row) from bbox interact with each other. This grouping affects transformations within that row (e.g., color changes or additions/extensions in x-direction).  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train input/output 1 (rows 1, 4, 8, 11 show position-based changes/additions within row); train 2 (scattered y but row-specific preservations like row 2 yellow); train 3 (rows 3, 4, 5-6, 6 show interactions via additions in same y). No contradictions.

2. **Position (x-coordinate/column) → Grouping for Vertical Interaction**  
   - Shapes sharing the same x (column) from bbox interact with each other. This grouping affects transformations within that column (e.g., color changes or additions/extensions in y-direction).  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train 1 (implicit in row fills affecting column positions); train 2 (columns 2, 9, 15, 18 show position-based changes/additions within column, e.g., col 9 extension); train 3 (columns 1, 5, 9, 13 show interactions via additions in same x). No contradictions.

3. **Pixel Count (>1) + Position Span (same x, varying y) → Vertical Extension**  
   - Multi-pixel shapes (pixels >1) with fixed x but spanning y (vertical bars) interact with their column's min y position: they extend upwards (decreasing y) to y=0, preserving original color, and increase pixel count accordingly. Single-pixel shapes (pixels=1) in the same column do not trigger this.  
   - Consistent in all trains: Explicitly occurs in train 2 (col 9, [9,7,9,8] pixels=2 → [9,0,9,8] pixels=9, green preserved) and train 3 (col 5 red [5,5,5,6] pixels=2 → [5,0,5,6] pixels=7; col 9 pink similar). Absent in train 1 (no vertical bars), so no contradiction. Exact extent (e.g., why to y=6 in train 3 vs. y=8 in train 2) is unknown—possibly tied to max y in input column, but not consistently explainable.

4. **Pixel Count (>1) + Position Span (same y, varying x) → Horizontal Extension**  
   - Multi-pixel shapes (pixels >1) with fixed y but spanning x (horizontal bars) interact with other shapes in the same row: they extend rightwards (increasing x) or fill positions within the row, potentially changing color based on co-occurring shapes. Single-pixel shapes do not trigger full extensions alone.  
   - Consistent in all trains: Explicitly occurs in train 1 (row 4 blue [0,4,1,4] pixels=2 → [0,4,8,4] pixels=9; row 11 maroon [0,11,1,11] pixels=2 transforms/extends to green [0,11,7,11] pixels=8). Absent in train 2 and 3 (no horizontal bars), so no contradiction. Exact color change mechanism (e.g., why maroon → green in row 11) is unknown—possibly linked to another shape's x in row, but not consistently explainable across cases.

5. **Color + Position (x or y extremum) → Color Propagation in Group**  
   - Color of a shape interacts with its position extremum (e.g., max x in row or min/max y in column) to propagate that color to other positions/shapes in the same group (row or column), overriding original colors of singles (pixels=1). This affects output colors but preserves positions of existing singles unless filled.  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train 1 (row 8: light blue at x=0,2 → pink like rightmost at x=6; row 11: maroon bar → green like rightmost single); train 2 (col 2: green at y=5,8 → yellow like topmost at y=2; col 18: light blue positions propagate around orange at y=3); train 3 (col 1 reds at y=4,6 propagate to new red at y=0,2; col 13 similar). Exact propagation rule (e.g., which extremum: max x, min y?) is unknown—varies slightly but consistently influences color without eliminating shapes.

6. **Pixel Count (1) + Position → Addition of New Singles**  
   - Single-pixel shapes (pixels=1) interact with their position (x/y) to trigger additions of new single-pixel shapes (pixels=1) in the same row/column, often matching the original color. Multi-pixel shapes do not directly trigger additions (they extend instead).  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train 1 (row 1 blues at x=0,3 → add blue at x=6; row 8 adds pink at x=4); train 2 (col 15 blues at y=4,8 → add blue at y=0; col 18 light blues add at y=0,2,4); train 3 (col 1 reds at y=4,6 → add reds at y=0,2; col 13 similar). No color change in additions—matches nearby originals. Exact placement of additions (e.g., why x=6 in train 1, y=0 in others) is unknown—tied to position but not explainable consistently.

### Notes on Scope
- These interactions are the only ones that are obvious and do not contradict any train example. For example, no consistent "hole" interaction (all holes=0, no effect). No consistent "full grid fill" (extent varies). No forced connections like "color → movement" (no evidence of relocation, only transformation/addition).
- Unknowns: Exact fill direction beyond vertical up/horizontal right (e.g., why some fills stop at input max x/y vs. beyond); precise extremum for color propagation (max x vs. min y); no interaction between rows/columns (e.g., no cross-group effects consistent across all).
- Test inputs were not analyzed for new connections, as the task focuses on consistent patterns from trains only. No elements without interaction (e.g., isolated singles with no group) were included.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in *every* train example (or do not contradict any example where the relevant elements are present). I focused only on properties like color, position (x/y from bbox), pixel count, and shape type (single vs. multi-pixel bar, determined by bbox span and pixels). No assumptions about semantic meaning, grid size, or overall puzzle logic were made. Interactions not present or inconsistent across all trains (e.g., specific fill patterns like "even columns only") are excluded. Where an exact mechanism cannot be explained without forcing a non-obvious connection, it is noted as unknown. Irrelevant elements (e.g., black background, holes=0 everywhere with no variation or effect) are omitted. No high-level solution or total understanding is provided.

1. **Position (y-coordinate/row) → Grouping for Horizontal Interaction**  
   - Shapes sharing the same y (row) from bbox interact with each other. This grouping affects transformations within that row (e.g., color changes or additions/extensions in x-direction).  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train input/output 1 (rows 1, 4, 8, 11 show position-based changes/additions within row); train 2 (scattered y but row-specific preservations like row 2 yellow); train 3 (rows 3, 4, 5-6, 6 show interactions via additions in same y). No contradictions.

2. **Position (x-coordinate/column) → Grouping for Vertical Interaction**  
   - Shapes sharing the same x (column) from bbox interact with each other. This grouping affects transformations within that column (e.g., color changes or additions/extensions in y-direction).  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train 1 (implicit in row fills affecting column positions); train 2 (columns 2, 9, 15, 18 show position-based changes/additions within column, e.g., col 9 extension); train 3 (columns 1, 5, 9, 13 show interactions via additions in same x). No contradictions.

3. **Pixel Count (>1) + Position Span (same x, varying y) → Vertical Extension**  
   - Multi-pixel shapes (pixels >1) with fixed x but spanning y (vertical bars) interact with their column's min y position: they extend upwards (decreasing y) to y=0, preserving original color, and increase pixel count accordingly. Single-pixel shapes (pixels=1) in the same column do not trigger this.  
   - Consistent in all trains: Explicitly occurs in train 2 (col 9, [9,7,9,8] pixels=2 → [9,0,9,8] pixels=9, green preserved) and train 3 (col 5 red [5,5,5,6] pixels=2 → [5,0,5,6] pixels=7; col 9 pink similar). Absent in train 1 (no vertical bars), so no contradiction. Exact extent (e.g., why to y=6 in train 3 vs. y=8 in train 2) is unknown—possibly tied to max y in input column, but not consistently explainable.

4. **Pixel Count (>1) + Position Span (same y, varying x) → Horizontal Extension**  
   - Multi-pixel shapes (pixels >1) with fixed y but spanning x (horizontal bars) interact with other shapes in the same row: they extend rightwards (increasing x) or fill positions within the row, potentially changing color based on co-occurring shapes. Single-pixel shapes do not trigger full extensions alone.  
   - Consistent in all trains: Explicitly occurs in train 1 (row 4 blue [0,4,1,4] pixels=2 → [0,4,8,4] pixels=9; row 11 maroon [0,11,1,11] pixels=2 transforms/extends to green [0,11,7,11] pixels=8). Absent in train 2 and 3 (no horizontal bars), so no contradiction. Exact color change mechanism (e.g., why maroon → green in row 11) is unknown—possibly linked to another shape's x in row, but not consistently explainable across cases.

5. **Color + Position (x or y extremum) → Color Propagation in Group**  
   - Color of a shape interacts with its position extremum (e.g., max x in row or min/max y in column) to propagate that color to other positions/shapes in the same group (row or column), overriding original colors of singles (pixels=1). This affects output colors but preserves positions of existing singles unless filled.  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train 1 (row 8: light blue at x=0,2 → pink like rightmost at x=6; row 11: maroon bar → green like rightmost single); train 2 (col 2: green at y=5,8 → yellow like topmost at y=2; col 18: light blue positions propagate around orange at y=3); train 3 (col 1 reds at y=4,6 propagate to new red at y=0,2; col 13 similar). Exact propagation rule (e.g., which extremum: max x, min y?) is unknown—varies slightly but consistently influences color without eliminating shapes.

6. **Pixel Count (1) + Position → Addition of New Singles**  
   - Single-pixel shapes (pixels=1) interact with their position (x/y) to trigger additions of new single-pixel shapes (pixels=1) in the same row/column, often matching the original color. Multi-pixel shapes do not directly trigger additions (they extend instead).  
   - Consistent in all trains: Seen in train 1 (row 1 blues at x=0,3 → add blue at x=6; row 8 adds pink at x=4); train 2 (col 15 blues at y=4,8 → add blue at y=0; col 18 light blues add at y=0,2,4); train 3 (col 1 reds at y=4,6 → add reds at y=0,2; col 13 similar). No color change in additions—matches nearby originals. Exact placement of additions (e.g., why x=6 in train 1, y=0 in others) is unknown—tied to position but not explainable consistently.

### Notes on Scope
- These interactions are the only ones that are obvious and do not contradict any train example. For example, no consistent "hole" interaction (all holes=0, no effect). No consistent "full grid fill" (extent varies). No forced connections like "color → movement" (no evidence of relocation, only transformation/addition).
- Unknowns: Exact fill direction beyond vertical up/horizontal right (e.g., why some fills stop at input max x/y vs. beyond); precise extremum for color propagation (max x vs. min y); no interaction between rows/columns (e.g., no cross-group effects consistent across all).
- Test inputs were not analyzed for new connections, as the task focuses on consistent patterns from trains only. No elements without interaction (e.g., isolated singles with no group) were included.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 04:22:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (colors) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (0s) based on detected arithmetic patterns in rows (horizontal mode) or columns (vertical mode), using GCD to identify common differences among positions of matching colors, and then propagating the color forward or based on majority/last occurrence rules. The mode switches based on whether rows outnumber columns, and filling prioritizes same-color groups or extends to the maximum position with the dominant color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Determine processing mode by comparing num_rows > num_cols (horizontal, process rows left-to-right) vs. otherwise (vertical, process columns bottom-to-top, with positions inverted as p = num_rows - 1 - ii).
 * For a starting color c at position 0 (or bottom in vertical), find all positions with c, compute GCD d of those positions (skip if d==0 or <=1 positions).
 * Candidates are positions k where k % d == r (r = first_pos % d), but only up to grid bounds.
 * If all candidate colors match c, fill all candidates with c; else, find max_pos among colored candidates, use its color as fill_color, and fill only up to <= max_pos.
 * Skip rows/columns if starting cell is 0 or no valid group_colors.
 * Vertical mode inverts row indices for position calculations (p increases upward from bottom), ensuring bottom-up processing.
 * GCD handles irregular spacing but assumes positions are integers starting from 0.
 * Output is a copy of input with only fills applied; unchanged 0s remain.
 * Subtle: In non-same color case, filling stops at max_pos to avoid overextending mismatched patterns; in vertical, candidates_p range to max_p = num_rows-1.
 * Easy to miss: Positions list must be built from actual g[i][j] == c, not output; d computed only on those positions, not all candidates.
 * Grids may be rectangular (rows != cols), and empty/sparse grids return empty.
 * No diagonal or multi-direction processing; strictly row or column based on mode.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from math import gcd
from typing import List

# Core program function as provided; it's the main tool for processing.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (full code as in attempt; handles mode detection, GCD computation, candidate filling)
    pass

# Implicit helper: Position finder for a color in row/col.
# Example extraction (not in code but useful for debugging):
def find_positions_in_row(g: List[List[int]], row_idx: int, color: int, num_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(num_cols) if g[row_idx][j] == color]

# Similar for column (adapt for vertical):
def find_positions_in_col(g: List[List[int]], col_idx: int, color: int, num_rows: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num_rows - 1 - i for i in range(num_rows) if g[i][col_idx] == color]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1-3 completely (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of mode switching, GCD-based pattern detection, and conditional filling rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and fills arithmetic progression patterns with same-color propagation or max_pos-limited extension; vertical mode inversion works for bottom-up processing; skips invalid cases (d=0, no positions, empty groups).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the generated output shows partial filling (e.g., isolated colors like 7 at (1,9), 2s at (1,17/20), 9 at (2,6), 5s at (2,19/20), 6 at (3,3), 2s at (3,19/20), 1 at (5,13), 6s at (5,15/20), 8s at (7,17/20), 4 at (8,7), 7s at (8,18/20)), but many rows remain mostly empty (e.g., rows 0,4,6 all 0s, row 8 incomplete), suggesting possible under-filling or missed patterns in sparse areas.
 * The attempt correctly copies the input grid and only modifies via fills, preserving unchanged 0s.
 * No unhelpful functions; the core program is relevant and mostly functional, but lacks explicit handling for edge cases like all-zero rows/cols or non-starting patterns (assumes start at 0/bottom).
 * Subtle issue: In test, filling seems to stop prematurely (e.g., no extension beyond visible max_pos in some rows), possibly due to candidate filtering or GCD=1 leading to over-broad but under-colored candidates; unknown if this mismatches expected full patterns.
 * Training successes imply core GCD and mode logic is right, but test may need tweaks for sparser grids or multiple overlapping groups per row/col.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x21 grid (inferred from row lengths), with fills applied to some cells but leaving large empty areas (e.g., entire columns 0-5 mostly 0 except scattered; rows 0,4,6 all 0s), which may indicate incomplete pattern detection rather than a fully solved puzzle.
 * Specific effects: Row 1 fills 7 (col9), 2s (cols17,20) – possibly from a GCD pattern starting elsewhere, but no fill between 9-17 suggests d>1 or mismatched colors; row 2 has 9 (col6) isolated, 5s at end (19/20) – looks like short extension, but why not more candidates?; row 3 similar with 6 (col3) and 2s at end; row 5 has 1 (col13), 6s (15/20) – pattern detected but gaps (cols14,16 empty); row 7: 8s at end; row 8: 4 (col7), 7s at end – consistent with max_pos rule but potentially missing leftward fills if patterns start non-zero.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely have more contiguous fills (e.g., extending 5s or 2s leftward if GCD allows), as training successes suggest complete pattern resolution; here, many 0s persist where arithmetic extensions seem plausible (e.g., col20 has vertical 2-5-2-?-?-6-?-8-7 pattern, but vertical mode might underfill if bottom !=c or d invalid). Unknown exact expected grid, but sparsity suggests program missed some starting c's or over-skipped due to len(positions)<=1.
 * Positive: Fills match visible input hints (assuming input had these seeds), and no overfills (e.g., no coloring outside patterns); makes partial sense for sparse test but likely incomplete for a "solved" puzzle.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 04:23:02] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train examples only, the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements (colored squares). These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect or connect with each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated singles with no apparent effect on others) or inconsistent interactions (e.g., sporadic color changes without a clear trigger across all) are excluded. Only direct, observable links are included; unknown mechanisms (e.g., exact length of extensions or addition rules) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Multi-pixel components (bars) and their orientation (horizontal vs. vertical)**:
   - **Interaction**: Multi-pixel components (pixels >1, indicated by bbox width >0 for horizontal or height >0 for vertical) consistently interact with their own structural properties (bbox dimensions and pixels count) to transform by extending along their primary axis (x for horizontal, y for vertical). This increases the bbox span and pixels count while maintaining the same y (for horizontal) or x (for vertical). The original position anchors the extension, but direction (e.g., left/right or up/down) varies.
   - **Effect**: Results in a denser, longer bar of the same color (or affected color, see color interaction below). Single-pixel components (pixels=1) do not exhibit this extension independently.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example:
     - Train 1: Horizontal blue bar (y=4, x=0-1, pixels=2) extends horizontally (to x=0-8, pixels=9); horizontal maroon bar (y=11, x=0-1, pixels=2) extends horizontally (to x=0-7, pixels=8).
     - Train 2: Vertical green bar (x=9, y=7-8, pixels=2) extends vertically (to y=0-8, pixels=9).
     - Train 3: Vertical red bar (x=5, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends vertically (to y=0-6, pixels=7); vertical pink bar (x=9, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends vertically (to y=0-6, pixels=7).
   - **Unknown**: Exact extension length or direction trigger (e.g., why 7/8/9 pixels; why downward in train 3 but full span in train 2).

2. **Position alignment (same row y or same column x) and multi-pixel components**:
   - **Interaction**: Multi-pixel components consistently connect with other elements (singles or other bars) sharing the same row (y) or column (x), affecting spatial transformation. Aligned elements influence the bar's extension endpoint or fill the aligned line partially/fully.
   - **Effect**: Bars extend to incorporate or abut aligned elements, altering positions of nearby singles (e.g., by overwriting or expanding into their space). This creates clustered or linear arrangements in output.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example where multi-pixel components exist:
     - Train 1: Horizontal maroon bar (y=11, x=0-1) aligns with green single (y=11, x=7), extending to x=7 (incorporating the aligned position).
     - Train 2: Vertical green bar (x=9, y=7-8) has no direct aligned singles at x=9, but extends full column (y=0-8), unaffected by non-aligned elements.
     - Train 3: Vertical red bar (x=5, y=5-6) and pink bar (x=9, y=5-6) extend downward (to y=0), with no same-x singles but affecting overall column density; aligned reds at x=1 and x=13 (various y) see additions at those x.
   - **Unknown**: Why extensions stop at specific points (e.g., not always full grid); no interaction if no aligned elements (as in parts of train 2).

3. **Color property and nearby/aligned elements (same row/column)**:
   - **Interaction**: Color of a multi-pixel component or nearby single (within same y or x) consistently affects the color of an extending bar or aligned group. Same-color alignment strengthens connection; different colors can propagate if adjacent.
   - **Effect**: The bar or group adopts the "influencing" color during extension, changing bbox pixels to the new color. Singles alone do not propagate without a multi-pixel trigger.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example with multi-pixel components (limited to cases where color shift is tied to alignment):
     - Train 1: Maroon bar (y=11) aligns with green single (same y=11, x=7), changing to green during horizontal extension.
     - Train 2: Green vertical bar (x=9) has no aligned different color, so stays green during extension.
     - Train 3: Red and pink vertical bars have no aligned different colors, so stay their colors during extension.
   - **Unknown**: Full propagation rule (e.g., why only in train 1; priority if multiple colors aligned); singles change color without multi-pixel trigger in some cases (e.g., train 2 greens to yellow at x=2), but this is not consistent across all examples and thus excluded.

4. **Single-pixel components (pixels=1) and position alignment (same row y or column x)**:
   - **Interaction**: Single-pixel components consistently connect via shared row (y) or column (x) to other singles or bars, but only when aligned with a transforming multi-pixel component (see above). Isolated singles (no alignment) remain unchanged.
   - **Effect**: Aligned singles either stay in position/color (if not overwritten) or trigger additions of new same-color singles nearby in the line (same y or x), increasing density without changing the original.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example:
     - Train 1: Blues singles (y=1, x=0 and 3) align in row y=1 (no bar, but mutual alignment), adding new blue single at x=6 y=1.
     - Train 2: Various singles align in columns (e.g., x=15 blues at y=4,8 add blue at y=0; x=18 light blues/orange at y=6,8,3 add light blues at y=0,2,4), staying or adding same color.
     - Train 3: Red singles align in columns (e.g., x=1 y=4,6 add red at y=0,2; x=13 y=3,6 add red at y=0), staying unchanged.
   - **Unknown**: Exact addition positions (e.g., why x=6 in train 1 y=1; why y=0/2 in train 3); color changes for non-aligned singles (e.g., train 2) are inconsistent and excluded.

### Notes
- **No other consistent interactions**: Holes=0 universally, with no effect or variation. Background grid/spacing indirectly enables position alignments but has no direct interaction. No consistent cross-row/column effects (e.g., diagonal or global). Semantic meanings (e.g., color symbolism) not identifiable from data.
- **Components involved**: Only colored squares (by color, bbox position, pixels). No irrelevant elements (e.g., empty cells) connect.
- **Test inputs**: Not analyzed, as instructions emphasize train examples for consistency.

[2025-10-03 04:26:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train examples only, the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements (colored squares). These are limited to properties and components that demonstrably affect or connect with each other in **every** train example (1, 2, and 3). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated singles with no apparent effect on others) or inconsistent interactions (e.g., sporadic color changes without a clear trigger across all) are excluded. Only direct, observable links are included; unknown mechanisms (e.g., exact length of extensions or addition rules) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Multi-pixel components (bars) and their orientation (horizontal vs. vertical)**:
   - **Interaction**: Multi-pixel components (pixels >1, indicated by bbox width >0 for horizontal or height >0 for vertical) consistently interact with their own structural properties (bbox dimensions and pixels count) to transform by extending along their primary axis (x for horizontal, y for vertical). This increases the bbox span and pixels count while maintaining the same y (for horizontal) or x (for vertical). The original position anchors the extension, but direction (e.g., left/right or up/down) varies.
   - **Effect**: Results in a denser, longer bar of the same color (or affected color, see color interaction below). Single-pixel components (pixels=1) do not exhibit this extension independently.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example:
     - Train 1: Horizontal blue bar (y=4, x=0-1, pixels=2) extends horizontally (to x=0-8, pixels=9); horizontal maroon bar (y=11, x=0-1, pixels=2) extends horizontally (to x=0-7, pixels=8).
     - Train 2: Vertical green bar (x=9, y=7-8, pixels=2) extends vertically (to y=0-8, pixels=9).
     - Train 3: Vertical red bar (x=5, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends vertically (to y=0-6, pixels=7); vertical pink bar (x=9, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends vertically (to y=0-6, pixels=7).
   - **Unknown**: Exact extension length or direction trigger (e.g., why 7/8/9 pixels; why downward in train 3 but full span in train 2).

2. **Position alignment (same row y or same column x) and multi-pixel components**:
   - **Interaction**: Multi-pixel components consistently connect with other elements (singles or other bars) sharing the same row (y) or column (x), affecting spatial transformation. Aligned elements influence the bar's extension endpoint or fill the aligned line partially/fully.
   - **Effect**: Bars extend to incorporate or abut aligned elements, altering positions of nearby singles (e.g., by overwriting or expanding into their space). This creates clustered or linear arrangements in output.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example where multi-pixel components exist:
     - Train 1: Horizontal maroon bar (y=11, x=0-1) aligns with green single (y=11, x=7), extending to x=7 (incorporating the aligned position).
     - Train 2: Vertical green bar (x=9, y=7-8) has no direct aligned singles at x=9, but extends full column (y=0-8), unaffected by non-aligned elements.
     - Train 3: Vertical red bar (x=5, y=5-6) and pink bar (x=9, y=5-6) extend downward (to y=0), with no same-x singles but affecting overall column density; aligned reds at x=1 and x=13 (various y) see additions at those x.
   - **Unknown**: Why extensions stop at specific points (e.g., not always full grid); no interaction if no aligned elements (as in parts of train 2).

3. **Color property and nearby/aligned elements (same row/column)**:
   - **Interaction**: Color of a multi-pixel component or nearby single (within same y or x) consistently affects the color of an extending bar or aligned group. Same-color alignment strengthens connection; different colors can propagate if adjacent.
   - **Effect**: The bar or group adopts the "influencing" color during extension, changing bbox pixels to the new color. Singles alone do not propagate without a multi-pixel trigger.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example with multi-pixel components (limited to cases where color shift is tied to alignment):
     - Train 1: Maroon bar (y=11) aligns with green single (same y=11, x=7), changing to green during horizontal extension.
     - Train 2: Green vertical bar (x=9) has no aligned different color, so stays green during extension.
     - Train 3: Red and pink vertical bars have no aligned different colors, so stay their colors during extension.
   - **Unknown**: Full propagation rule (e.g., why only in train 1; priority if multiple colors aligned); singles change color without multi-pixel trigger in some cases (e.g., train 2 greens to yellow at x=2), but this is not consistent across all examples and thus excluded.

4. **Single-pixel components (pixels=1) and position alignment (same row y or column x)**:
   - **Interaction**: Single-pixel components consistently connect via shared row (y) or column (x) to other singles or bars, but only when aligned with a transforming multi-pixel component (see above). Isolated singles (no alignment) remain unchanged.
   - **Effect**: Aligned singles either stay in position/color (if not overwritten) or trigger additions of new same-color singles nearby in the line (same y or x), increasing density without changing the original.
   - **Consistency**: Present in every example:
     - Train 1: Blues singles (y=1, x=0 and 3) align in row y=1 (no bar, but mutual alignment), adding new blue single at x=6 y=1.
     - Train 2: Various singles align in columns (e.g., x=15 blues at y=4,8 add blue at y=0; x=18 light blues/orange at y=6,8,3 add light blues at y=0,2,4), staying or adding same color.
     - Train 3: Red singles align in columns (e.g., x=1 y=4,6 add red at y=0,2; x=13 y=3,6 add red at y=0), staying unchanged.
   - **Unknown**: Exact addition positions (e.g., why x=6 in train 1 y=1; why y=0/2 in train 3); color changes for non-aligned singles (e.g., train 2) are inconsistent and excluded.

### Notes
- **No other consistent interactions**: Holes=0 universally, with no effect or variation. Background grid/spacing indirectly enables position alignments but has no direct interaction. No consistent cross-row/column effects (e.g., diagonal or global). Semantic meanings (e.g., color symbolism) not identifiable from data.
- **Components involved**: Only colored squares (by color, bbox position, pixels). No irrelevant elements (e.g., empty cells) connect.
- **Test inputs**: Not analyzed, as instructions emphasize train examples for consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 04:40:19] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero-valued cells (empty spaces) by propagating colors from existing non-zero patterns, either horizontally or vertically depending on the grid's aspect ratio (taller grids horizontal, wider vertical). The propagation follows arithmetic sequences based on distances between paired identical colors, extending through zeros while adapting to encountered colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify pairs of identical non-zero colors in a line (row or column); if more or fewer than two occurrences, skip that color.
 * Compute the distance d between the pair's positions, then extend the pattern bidirectionally: fill zeros with the current color, continue with same color if matched, or switch to a new color if a different non-zero is hit and include that position.
 * Choose direction based on grid shape: horizontal propagation for h > w (row-wise), vertical for h <= w (column-wise); this ensures the longer dimension is processed first.
 * Extension stops at grid boundaries or when no further progress is possible (e.g., non-extendable non-zero without matching pattern).
 * Subtlety: Propagation can chain colors (e.g., hitting a different color changes the propagating color for further extension), but only for exactly two initial positions per color; multiple pairs or singles are ignored.
 * Zeros are placeholders to fill but not initiators; non-zeros must form the seed pairs.
 * Potential miss: Over-extension if d=0 (same position, but code assumes distinct); or failure to handle sparse grids where pairs are far apart.
 * In vertical mode, transpose logic by processing columns as lists.
 * All changes are in-place on a copied grid to avoid side effects.
 * Edge case: Empty grid or single row/column returns unchanged; colors >9 or negatives unhandled (assume 1-9 positives).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

# Core transform function for a single line (row or column)
def transform_line(original: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Groups positions by color, skips if not exactly 2 positions
    # Computes d = p2 - p1, extends up/down with while loops filling zeros or adapting color
    # Returns modified line with positions set to final color
    pass  # (as in provided code; useful for modular testing of propagation)

# Horizontal applicator: processes each row via transform_line
def apply_horizontal(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Copies grid, applies transform_line to each row
    pass  # (as in code; essential for row-wise puzzles)

# Vertical applicator: extracts columns, transforms, reinserts
def apply_vertical(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Copies grid, builds column lists, transforms each, updates grid
    pass  # (as in code; key for column-wise, handles transposition implicitly)

# Main dispatcher
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Checks h > w for horizontal else vertical; handles empty
    pass  # (as in code; decides orientation based on dimensions)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly identifying pairs and propagating through zeros with color adaptation.
 * Worked well for dense patterns in training where pairs had clear distances and extensions filled expected zeros without overreaching.
 * Did not work for the test input: propagation seems incomplete, as the output remains mostly zeros with only isolated numbers (e.g., 7,2,6 in row 1; 9,5,5 in row 2), suggesting failures to detect pairs, compute proper d, or extend chains across the sparse 21x9 grid.
 * Code assumes exactly two positions per color to start; test may have colors with 1 or >2 instances, causing skips and under-filling.
 * Extension logic breaks early on non-matching non-zeros without including them fully, leading to partial fills (e.g., row 8 has 8s but no extension visible).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components or blobs) was attempted, but it's not needed here—propagation is linear, not blob-based; future attempts should avoid blob extraction as irrelevant.
 * The orientation choice (h > w) worked for training but may mismatch test if grid is square-ish (21 rows? output shows 9 lines, perhaps test is wider).
 * Function `transform_line` is helpful and core but buggy in test: likely misses multi-pair colors or zero-d distances.
 * No unhelpful functions noted beyond potential overcomplication with defaultdict (but it's fine).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows a 9-row grid (possibly truncated from 21?) with vast majority zeros and only scattered single or paired numbers (e.g., row 1: 7 at col9, 2 at col17, 6 at col20; row 2: 9 at col6, 5s at col19-20), indicating minimal propagation occurred.
 * Expected more filling: test input (inferred from output patterns) likely has seed numbers like 6s, 2s, 7s, 5s, 9s, 1s, 8s, 4s that should pair and extend across rows/columns, filling long zero stretches (e.g., row 0 all zeros suggests no vertical propagation hit it).
 * Differences from expected: Output ignores potential vertical pairs (e.g., 6 in row3 col3 and row5 col15? no fill between); horizontal extensions stalled (e.g., two 5s in row2 col19-20 should extend left/right with d=1, but nothing added). This is different because training succeeded on similar propagations—test sparsity or >2 instances per color likely broke pair detection.
 * No chaining observed (e.g., 7 in row1 col9 and row8 col17? no vertical fill), so output under-fills dramatically compared to a correct solution that should densely populate based on arithmetic extensions.
 * Looks incorrect overall: too sparse, no evidence of bidirectional extension or color switches, failing to transform the grid meaningfully.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 04:40:46] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train input/output pair (i.e., train 1, 2, and 3). Only elements with demonstrated interactions (e.g., influencing position, size, or grouping) are included; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated singles with no grouping) are excluded unless they participate in a connection. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation explanations are provided. Where a specific interaction mechanism (e.g., exact addition rule) cannot be clearly tied consistently across all examples without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Color + Position (Shared y-coordinate) → Horizontal Grouping/Transformation**
   - **Description**: Squares of the **same color** sharing the exact same y-coordinate (row) interact to influence horizontal arrangements along the x-axis in the output. This results in changes to positions (e.g., additions or shifts along x) or size (e.g., extension into multi-pixel horizontal bars or spaced patterns).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Blues at y=1 (x=0,3) → output adds blue at x=6, y=1 (spaced pattern). Light blues + pink at y=8 → output pinks at x=0,2,4,6, y=8 (spaced with addition). Blue at y=4 → output horizontal blue bar spanning x=0-8, y=4.
     - Train 2: No multi-square same-color groups per row in input, and no horizontal transformations occur (consistent absence where no interaction trigger).
     - Train 3: No multi-square same-color groups per row in input (e.g., y=6 has multiple reds but at non-adjacent x), and no horizontal transformations occur (consistent absence).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Color links the squares for grouping.
     - y-coordinate defines the shared axis for interaction.
     - x-positions are affected (e.g., new x added or bbox expanded horizontally).
     - Pixels/bbox size increases if extended (e.g., from 1-2 to 8-9 pixels).
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Exact rule for additions (e.g., why x=6 added in train 1 y=1, or why fill to x=8 in y=4); color may shift within group (e.g., light blue → pink in train 1 y=8), but mechanism unknown.

#### 2. **Color + Position (Shared x-coordinate) → Vertical Grouping/Transformation**
   - **Description**: Squares of the **same color** sharing the exact same x-coordinate (column) interact to influence vertical arrangements along the y-axis in the output. This results in changes to positions (e.g., additions or extensions along y) or size (e.g., filling into multi-pixel vertical bars).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: No same-color squares share x in input, and no vertical transformations occur (consistent absence where no interaction trigger).
     - Train 2: Blues at x=15 (y=4,8) → output adds blue at y=0, x=15. Light blues at x=18 (y=6,8) → output adds light blues at y=0,2,4, x=18. Greens at x=2 (y=5,8) → output changes to yellow but adds/extends pattern at x=2 (y=2,5,8 all yellow). Green at x=9 (y=7-8) → output vertical green bar y=0-8, x=9.
     - Train 3: Reds at x=1 (y=4,6) → output adds reds at y=0,2, x=1. Reds at x=13 (y=3,6) → output adds red at y=0, x=13. Red at x=5 (y=5-6) → output vertical red bar y=0-6, x=5. Pink at x=9 (y=5-6) → output vertical pink bar y=0-6, x=9.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Color links the squares for grouping.
     - x-coordinate defines the shared axis for interaction.
     - y-positions are affected (e.g., new y added or bbox expanded vertically, often toward y=0).
     - Pixels/bbox size increases if extended (e.g., from 1-2 to 7-9 pixels).
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Exact fill direction/length (e.g., why to y=0 and specific gaps like y=2 in train 3 x=1); color may propagate or change within group (e.g., green → yellow in train 2 x=2), but mechanism unknown.

#### 3. **Adjacency (Bbox Touching/Overlap) + Color + Position → Initial Connected Component Formation**
   - **Description**: Squares of the **same color** with adjacent bboxes (touching edges, e.g., consecutive x in same y or consecutive y in same x) interact in input to form a single component, which carries forward to influence output extensions (e.g., the component's bbox/pixels seed larger bars).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Blue bbox [0,4,1,4] (pixels=2, adjacent x=0-1 at y=4) → seeds horizontal bar in output. Maroon bbox [0,11,1,11] (pixels=2, adjacent x=0-1 at y=11) → influences horizontal bar in output.
     - Train 2: Green bbox [9,7,9,8] (pixels=2, adjacent y=7-8 at x=9) → seeds vertical bar in output.
     - Train 3: Red bbox [5,5,5,6] (pixels=2, adjacent y=5-6 at x=5) → seeds vertical bar. Pink bbox [9,5,9,6] (pixels=2, adjacent y=5-6 at x=9) → seeds vertical bar.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Color ensures only same-color adjacencies connect.
     - Bbox (position/extent) defines adjacency (e.g., Δx=1 same y or Δy=1 same x).
     - Results in combined pixels (>1) and merged bbox, which affects output scale (e.g., seed for larger extension).
   - **Unknown Aspects**: How the initial size precisely scales in output (e.g., why 2 pixels → 7-9 pixels consistently, but exact multiplier unknown).

#### Excluded Elements/Interactions (Not Consistent Across All Trains)
- **Background (black)**: Uniform and unchanged; no interaction with any elements (present but irrelevant in all).
- **Holes**: Always 0; no variation or effect on anything.
- **Mixed-color groups in same row/column**: Occur (e.g., train 1 y=11 maroon+green; train 2 y=8 green+blue+light blue), but output handling (e.g., color dominance) is inconsistent and unknown—not reliably tied to transformations in every example.
- **Isolated single-pixel squares (no shared color+x or color+y)**: No interactions; remain unchanged or unaffected in all trains (e.g., orange at x=18 y=3 in train 2 kept as-is).
- **Non-axis-aligned connections**: No evidence of diagonal or arbitrary proximity interactions in any train.

These connections are the only obvious, consistent ones derivable directly from comparing inputs/outputs without forcing unrelated links. All transformations involve position and color interplay, but exact mechanics (e.g., addition rules, color shifts) are unknown where not uniformly explainable across examples.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 04:44:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the three train examples, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train input/output pair (i.e., train 1, 2, and 3). Only elements with demonstrated interactions (e.g., influencing position, size, or grouping) are included; irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., isolated singles with no grouping) are excluded unless they participate in a connection. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation explanations are provided. Where a specific interaction mechanism (e.g., exact addition rule) cannot be clearly tied consistently across all examples without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Color + Position (Shared y-coordinate) → Horizontal Grouping/Transformation**
   - **Description**: Squares of the **same color** sharing the exact same y-coordinate (row) interact to influence horizontal arrangements along the x-axis in the output. This results in changes to positions (e.g., additions or shifts along x) or size (e.g., extension into multi-pixel horizontal bars or spaced patterns).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Blues at y=1 (x=0,3) → output adds blue at x=6, y=1 (spaced pattern). Light blues + pink at y=8 → output pinks at x=0,2,4,6, y=8 (spaced with addition). Blue at y=4 → output horizontal blue bar spanning x=0-8, y=4.
     - Train 2: No multi-square same-color groups per row in input, and no horizontal transformations occur (consistent absence where no interaction trigger).
     - Train 3: No multi-square same-color groups per row in input (e.g., y=6 has multiple reds but at non-adjacent x), and no horizontal transformations occur (consistent absence).
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Color links the squares for grouping.
     - y-coordinate defines the shared axis for interaction.
     - x-positions are affected (e.g., new x added or bbox expanded horizontally).
     - Pixels/bbox size increases if extended (e.g., from 1-2 to 8-9 pixels).
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Exact rule for additions (e.g., why x=6 added in train 1 y=1, or why fill to x=8 in y=4); color may shift within group (e.g., light blue → pink in train 1 y=8), but mechanism unknown.

#### 2. **Color + Position (Shared x-coordinate) → Vertical Grouping/Transformation**
   - **Description**: Squares of the **same color** sharing the exact same x-coordinate (column) interact to influence vertical arrangements along the y-axis in the output. This results in changes to positions (e.g., additions or extensions along y) or size (e.g., filling into multi-pixel vertical bars).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: No same-color squares share x in input, and no vertical transformations occur (consistent absence where no interaction trigger).
     - Train 2: Blues at x=15 (y=4,8) → output adds blue at y=0, x=15. Light blues at x=18 (y=6,8) → output adds light blues at y=0,2,4, x=18. Greens at x=2 (y=5,8) → output changes to yellow but adds/extends pattern at x=2 (y=2,5,8 all yellow). Green at x=9 (y=7-8) → output vertical green bar y=0-8, x=9.
     - Train 3: Reds at x=1 (y=4,6) → output adds reds at y=0,2, x=1. Reds at x=13 (y=3,6) → output adds red at y=0, x=13. Red at x=5 (y=5-6) → output vertical red bar y=0-6, x=5. Pink at x=9 (y=5-6) → output vertical pink bar y=0-6, x=9.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Color links the squares for grouping.
     - x-coordinate defines the shared axis for interaction.
     - y-positions are affected (e.g., new y added or bbox expanded vertically, often toward y=0).
     - Pixels/bbox size increases if extended (e.g., from 1-2 to 7-9 pixels).
   - **Unknown Aspects**: Exact fill direction/length (e.g., why to y=0 and specific gaps like y=2 in train 3 x=1); color may propagate or change within group (e.g., green → yellow in train 2 x=2), but mechanism unknown.

#### 3. **Adjacency (Bbox Touching/Overlap) + Color + Position → Initial Connected Component Formation**
   - **Description**: Squares of the **same color** with adjacent bboxes (touching edges, e.g., consecutive x in same y or consecutive y in same x) interact in input to form a single component, which carries forward to influence output extensions (e.g., the component's bbox/pixels seed larger bars).
   - **Consistency Across All Trains**:
     - Train 1: Blue bbox [0,4,1,4] (pixels=2, adjacent x=0-1 at y=4) → seeds horizontal bar in output. Maroon bbox [0,11,1,11] (pixels=2, adjacent x=0-1 at y=11) → influences horizontal bar in output.
     - Train 2: Green bbox [9,7,9,8] (pixels=2, adjacent y=7-8 at x=9) → seeds vertical bar in output.
     - Train 3: Red bbox [5,5,5,6] (pixels=2, adjacent y=5-6 at x=5) → seeds vertical bar. Pink bbox [9,5,9,6] (pixels=2, adjacent y=5-6 at x=9) → seeds vertical bar.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - Color ensures only same-color adjacencies connect.
     - Bbox (position/extent) defines adjacency (e.g., Δx=1 same y or Δy=1 same x).
     - Results in combined pixels (>1) and merged bbox, which affects output scale (e.g., seed for larger extension).
   - **Unknown Aspects**: How the initial size precisely scales in output (e.g., why 2 pixels → 7-9 pixels consistently, but exact multiplier unknown).

#### Excluded Elements/Interactions (Not Consistent Across All Trains)
- **Background (black)**: Uniform and unchanged; no interaction with any elements (present but irrelevant in all).
- **Holes**: Always 0; no variation or effect on anything.
- **Mixed-color groups in same row/column**: Occur (e.g., train 1 y=11 maroon+green; train 2 y=8 green+blue+light blue), but output handling (e.g., color dominance) is inconsistent and unknown—not reliably tied to transformations in every example.
- **Isolated single-pixel squares (no shared color+x or color+y)**: No interactions; remain unchanged or unaffected in all trains (e.g., orange at x=18 y=3 in train 2 kept as-is).
- **Non-axis-aligned connections**: No evidence of diagonal or arbitrary proximity interactions in any train.

These connections are the only obvious, consistent ones derivable directly from comparing inputs/outputs without forcing unrelated links. All transformations involve position and color interplay, but exact mechanics (e.g., addition rules, color shifts) are unknown where not uniformly explainable across examples.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:01:12] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or patterns) where the goal is to extend or complete linear chains of identical numbers in rows and columns based on detected pairs with consistent spacing (arithmetic progression), filling empty cells (0s) while handling conflicts by propagating a dominant or conflicting value, but only under specific conditions to avoid overfilling or incorrect propagation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify pairs of identical non-zero numbers in the same row or column with a consistent distance d > 0; only process pairs (exactly 2 positions per color per line), ignoring singles or larger groups initially.
 * Extend chains bidirectionally (up/down for columns, left/right for rows) by multiples of d into empty (0) cells, filling them with the original color c unless a conflict occurs (non-zero, non-c cell encountered).
 * On conflict, stop extension at that point, propagate the conflicting color backward over the entire chain (including original positions), and do not fill beyond the conflict.
 * Process vertical (columns) transformations before horizontal (rows) to prioritize vertical patterns, but this order can cause cascading errors if horizontal passes overwrite or interact poorly.
 * Do not extend if d == 0 (same position) or if no empty cells fit the extension; chains must stay within grid bounds.
 * Subtlety: Extensions only fill 0s in non-conflict cases; existing same-color cells in the potential chain are kept but not used to trigger new pairs—re-process only based on initial pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Conflicts propagate the new color to the whole chain set (original + extended positions up to conflict), but only if a true conflict (different non-zero) is hit; same-color in path just extends normally.
 * Overfilling issue: Running vertical then horizontal can cause unintended fills (e.g., a vertical extension creates a new horizontal pair that overextends).
 * No diagonal or multi-line interactions; strictly row/column linear.
 * Grid may have irregular widths/heights, but assume rectangular; empty grid returns empty.
 * Potential for multiple pairs per line/color, but process each independently—could overlap and cause issues if not handled sequentially.
 * In examples, patterns like spaced 1's or 6's suggest periodic fills (e.g., every 3rd position), but only extend if pair detected; full lines (e.g., all 1's) may not trigger pair-based extension.
 * Conflicts seem to "assimilate" chains to the conflicting color, suggesting a dominance rule where stronger patterns overwrite weaker ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# The main program function is helpful as a base: it uses defaultdict to group positions by color, sorts pairs, computes d, generates potential extension lists (up/down or left/right), checks for conflicts sequentially, and applies fills or overwrites to chain_set.
# No separate classes or extraction functions are present, but the pos_by_c defaultdict(list) for grouping positions per color per line is key for identifying pairs.
# The chain_set = set([p, q]) initialization and incremental addition during extension (or up to conflict) is useful for tracking what to modify.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles some periodic vertical/horizontal extensions without conflicts, as seen in Training example 2 passing fully.
 * Failed in Training example 1 by incorrectly filling extraneous 1's: generated [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in row 7 (expected all 0s) and [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in row 10 (expected all 0s), likely due to over-extension from the row 1 pattern of 1's at cols 0,3,6 (d=3) propagating downward beyond intended bounds or interacting with horizontal passes; also minor mismatch in row 0/9 being all 0s but positions swapped in listing? (unclear, but outputs differ in filled 1's where no pattern justifies).
 * Succeeded in Training example 2 (full match, no specifics on grid but implies correct extension/conflict handling for that case).
 * Failed in Training example 3 by propagating wrong colors: generated row 2 as [0,6,0,...] (expected [0,2,0,...]), row 4 as [0,6,0,...] (expected [0,2,0,...]), and similar in other even/odd rows, suggesting vertical extension from 6's in col 1 overwrote or conflicted incorrectly with 2's pattern (alternating 2's every other row in cols 1,5,13); horizontal pass may not have corrected it, indicating order or conflict resolution bug.
 * The vertical-first-then-horizontal order worked for train 2 but caused overpropagation in train 1/3 (e.g., vertical fills create unintended horizontal pairs).
 * No separate object extraction function; the inline pos_by_c grouping is helpful but could be extracted for reuse to avoid re-scanning grid multiple times.
 * Conflict handling (propagating new_c to chain_set) is partially correct but over-applies in non-conflict paths (fills 0s only, but in examples it wrongly fills where no extension should occur).
 * The potential_up/down/left/right list generation via while loop is accurate for arithmetic sequences but misses if multiple chains overlap or if d varies.
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the entire program is brittle to order (vertical before horizontal) and doesn't re-scan for new pairs after fills, leading to incomplete propagation in complex grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial fills like row 1 with isolated 7,2,6; row 2 all 9's (possibly a full horizontal line not extended vertically); row 3 with 6,2,6 at ends; row 5 with spaced 6's and a 1; row 7 spaced 8's; row 8 alternating 7's with a 4 anomaly. This suggests over-extension vertically (e.g., 6's in col 0 rows 0-8? but row 0 all 0s) and horizontal (9's in row 2), but mismatches expected patterns—inferred rules from training suggest vertical 6's in col 20 should extend upward/downward by d from pairs (e.g., row3 col20=6, row5 col20=6 implies d=2, filling row1/7 col20 with 6 if empty, but generated row1 col20=6 correctly? wait, listing cuts off); however, the 4 in row8 col7 looks like an unhandled conflict or input remnant, and spaced 7's in row8 didn't extend left/right fully (e.g., d=2 from positions, but stops prematurely). It fails to propagate 9's vertically from row2 (expected to fill above/below if pairs form), and isolated 2 in row1 col17 suggests missed horizontal pair with row3 col19=2 (d= something, but not extended). Overall, looks like partial understanding: some chains filled (e.g., 8's in row7), but conflicts mishandled (4 not assimilated), and order causes incomplete test grid completion—does not match mentally simulated rules (e.g., full vertical 6 chain in col0/5/10/15/20 should fill all rows if d=1 pairs detected, but generated sparsely).

[2025-10-03 05:01:28] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the train inputs/outputs (1-3), the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** train examples. These are limited to properties that demonstrably affect or transform other elements (e.g., position, color, size via pixels/bbox expansion, or addition of new elements) in every case where the condition applies. Only consistent patterns are included—no assumptions about puzzle-wide rules, no irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., singleton blocks with no multiples in row/column that remain unchanged are excluded as they show no interaction), and no forced connections. Transformations that cannot be directly tied to an obvious property link are noted as unknown. Test inputs are not analyzed, as consistency is required across train examples only.

#### 1. **Same-Color Blocks in the Same Column (Vertical Interaction)**
   - **Description**: When multiple blocks of the **same color** share a column (x-coordinate fixed, varying y), they consistently interact to form or expand a single vertical structure. This occurs in train2 (e.g., Greens at x=9 y=7-8) and train3 (e.g., Reds at x=5 y=5-6; Reds at x=1 y=4 & y=6; Reds at x=13 y=3 & y=6; Pinks at x=9 y=5-6). No such vertical same-color multiples in train1, so consistent where present.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (y-coordinates) → Size/bbox Expansion**: The y-range of the group expands upward (toward y=0) to fill from y=0 to the maximum y in the group or grid height. Examples:
       - Train2: Input y=7-8 → Output bbox y=0-8 (pixels from 2 → 9).
       - Train3: Input y=5-6 → Output y=0-6 (pixels from 2 → 7); spaced y=4 & y=6 → No merge but adds new block at y=0 (pixels=1 added); spaced y=3 & y=6 → Adds new block at y=0 (pixels=1 added).
     - **Position (y-coordinates) → Addition of New Blocks**: New same-color blocks (pixels=1) are added in the same column at specific y-positions (often y=0 or to fill gaps toward y=0), but exact placement pattern (e.g., every N units or parity) is unknown—consistent addition occurs but transformation details unclear.
       - Train3: Adds Red at x=1 y=0 & y=2 (from spaced y=4 & y=6); adds Red at x=13 y=0 (from spaced y=3 & y=6).
       - Train2: No additions for the vertical Green group, but see mixed-color below for related column additions.
     - **No Color Change**: Same-color vertical groups never change color; they unify/expand as the original color.
   - **Unknowns**: Why some gaps are filled with additions vs. full expansion (e.g., train3 x=1 adds discrete y=0 & y=2 but not full merge; train2 x=9 full merges). No horizontal spread from these vertical groups.

#### 2. **Different-Color Blocks in the Same Column (Vertical Color Propagation)**
   - **Description**: When blocks of **different colors** share a column, the color of one propagates to change others in the column. This occurs in train2 (e.g., x=2: Yellow at y=2 with Greens at y=5 & y=8). Train3 has no mixed-color columns with multiples. Train1 has no column multiples at all. Consistent where mixed vertical multiples appear.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (y-coordinate relative to others) → Color Change**: The color of the topmost (lowest y) block in the column propagates downward to overwrite lower blocks' colors.
       - Train2: Top Yellow (y=2) changes lower Greens (y=5 & y=8) to Yellow. Positions stay the same, but color unifies to top block's color.
     - **No Size/bbox Change or Merging**: Changed blocks remain same size (pixels=1); no expansion or addition directly from this interaction (though see same-color vertical for related additions in other columns).
   - **Unknowns**: Propagation is downward only (no upward changes observed); why not full column unification if more mixed examples existed. No similar propagation in rows (see below).

#### 3. **Same-Color Blocks in the Same Row (Horizontal Interaction)**
   - **Description**: When multiple blocks of the **same color** share a row (y-coordinate fixed, varying x), they interact to expand or add in the row. This occurs in train1 (e.g., y=1: Blues at x=0 & x=3; y=4: Blues at x=0-1 adjacent; y=11: Maroon at x=0-1 with Green at x=7—note Maroon treated as compatible with Green for expansion, but see mixed below). No same-color row multiples in train2 or train3 (train3 y=6 has spaced Reds but treated as column interaction priority). Consistent where present without column conflicts.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (x-coordinates) → Size/bbox Expansion**: The x-range expands to fill the row horizontally (from min x to max x or full grid width), merging into one block.
       - Train1: y=4 adjacent Blues x=0-1 (pixels=2) → Full row bbox x=0-8 (pixels=9); y=11 Maroon x=0-1 + Green x=7 (pixels=2+1) → Full row Green x=0-7 (pixels=8).
     - **Position (x-coordinates) → Addition of New Blocks**: New same-color blocks (pixels=1) added in the row to extend the pattern (e.g., arithmetic progression in x).
       - Train1: y=1 Blues at x=0 & x=3 → Adds Blue at x=6 (extends every 3 units).
   - **Unknowns**: Expansion width (e.g., to x=8 vs. x=7) varies; exact addition spacing unknown (consistent progression but not uniform across rows). Maroon-Green compatibility for expansion unexplained (color similarity?).

#### 4. **Different-Color Blocks in the Same Row (Horizontal Color Propagation)**
   - **Description**: When blocks of **different colors** share a row, the rightmost block's color propagates leftward to unify the row. This occurs in train1 (y=8: Light Blues at x=0 & x=2 + Pink at x=6; y=11: Maroon left + Green right). No mixed-color row multiples in train2/3 (train2 y=8 has mixed but overridden by column priority, changing only left block via column). Consistent where present without column conflicts.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (x-coordinate relative to others) → Color Change**: Rightmost block's color overwrites left blocks' colors; positions may stay or adjust slightly to fill gaps.
       - Train1: y=8 rightmost Pink (x=6) changes left Light Blues (x=0 & x=2) to Pink; adds new Pink at x=4 (fills gap); all remain pixels=1 (no merge).
       - Train1: y=11 rightmost Green (x=7) changes left Maroon (x=0-1) to Green (then expands as same-color horizontal).
     - **Position (x-coordinates) → Addition of New Blocks**: New blocks of the propagated color added to fill gaps in x.
       - Train1: y=8 adds Pink at x=4 (between x=2 & x=6).
   - **Unknowns**: Why y=8 results in discrete singles (every 2 units) vs. full merge like y=11 (propagation + expansion). Light Blue → Pink change unexplained (hue similarity?); no downward propagation observed.

#### General Consistent Notes Across All Interactions
- **Priority: Column over Row**: When a block participates in both row and column multiples, vertical (column) interaction takes priority for color/position changes (e.g., train2 y=8 mixed row ignored for color; left block changes via column instead). No counterexamples.
- **Color as Key Property**: All interactions preserve or propagate a single color within the group; no mixing of final colors in output structures. Holes=0 always (no interaction with holes).
- **Pixels/bbox as Outcome**: Interactions consistently affect size (via merge/expansion) or add new pixels=1 blocks; bbox adjusts to reflect this (e.g., wider x for horizontal, taller y for vertical).
- **Irrelevant/Non-Interacting Elements**: Isolated singles (no other same-row or same-column blocks) remain unchanged in position, color, size (e.g., many in train2 like Orange at x=18 y=3 stays; train3 Red at x=13 y=3 stays). These show no connections.
- **Unknown Transformations**: Exact grid bounds (e.g., why expand to x=8 or y=8 specifically) unknown; addition patterns (e.g., spacing like every 2/3/4 units) consistent but rule unclear; no observed interactions between non-sharing row/column blocks or across diagonals.
- **No Inconsistent Elements**: No properties like holes (always 0) or silhouettes affect anything; only color, position (x/y), and pixels/bbox show links. No semantic meanings (e.g., shapes beyond color/position) identifiable.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 05:06:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or patterns) where the goal is to extend or complete linear chains of identical numbers in rows and columns based on detected pairs with consistent spacing (arithmetic progression), filling empty cells (0s) while handling conflicts by propagating a dominant or conflicting value, but only under specific conditions to avoid overfilling or incorrect propagation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify pairs of identical non-zero numbers in the same row or column with a consistent distance d > 0; only process pairs (exactly 2 positions per color per line), ignoring singles or larger groups initially.
 * Extend chains bidirectionally (up/down for columns, left/right for rows) by multiples of d into empty (0) cells, filling them with the original color c unless a conflict occurs (non-zero, non-c cell encountered).
 * On conflict, stop extension at that point, propagate the conflicting color backward over the entire chain (including original positions), and do not fill beyond the conflict.
 * Process vertical (columns) transformations before horizontal (rows) to prioritize vertical patterns, but this order can cause cascading errors if horizontal passes overwrite or interact poorly.
 * Do not extend if d == 0 (same position) or if no empty cells fit the extension; chains must stay within grid bounds.
 * Subtlety: Extensions only fill 0s in non-conflict cases; existing same-color cells in the potential chain are kept but not used to trigger new pairs—re-process only based on initial pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Conflicts propagate the new color to the whole chain set (original + extended positions up to conflict), but only if a true conflict (different non-zero) is hit; same-color in path just extends normally.
 * Overfilling issue: Running vertical then horizontal can cause unintended fills (e.g., a vertical extension creates a new horizontal pair that overextends).
 * No diagonal or multi-line interactions; strictly row/column linear.
 * Grid may have irregular widths/heights, but assume rectangular; empty grid returns empty.
 * Potential for multiple pairs per line/color, but process each independently—could overlap and cause issues if not handled sequentially.
 * In examples, patterns like spaced 1's or 6's suggest periodic fills (e.g., every 3rd position), but only extend if pair detected; full lines (e.g., all 1's) may not trigger pair-based extension.
 * Conflicts seem to "assimilate" chains to the conflicting color, suggesting a dominance rule where stronger patterns overwrite weaker ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# The main program function is helpful as a base: it uses defaultdict to group positions by color, sorts pairs, computes d, generates potential extension lists (up/down or left/right), checks for conflicts sequentially, and applies fills or overwrites to chain_set.
# No separate classes or extraction functions are present, but the pos_by_c defaultdict(list) for grouping positions per color per line is key for identifying pairs.
# The chain_set = set([p, q]) initialization and incremental addition during extension (or up to conflict) is useful for tracking what to modify.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles some periodic vertical/horizontal extensions without conflicts, as seen in Training example 2 passing fully.
 * Failed in Training example 1 by incorrectly filling extraneous 1's: generated [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in row 7 (expected all 0s) and [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in row 10 (expected all 0s), likely due to over-extension from the row 1 pattern of 1's at cols 0,3,6 (d=3) propagating downward beyond intended bounds or interacting with horizontal passes; also minor mismatch in row 0/9 being all 0s but positions swapped in listing? (unclear, but outputs differ in filled 1's where no pattern justifies).
 * Succeeded in Training example 2 (full match, no specifics on grid but implies correct extension/conflict handling for that case).
 * Failed in Training example 3 by propagating wrong colors: generated row 2 as [0,6,0,...] (expected [0,2,0,...]), row 4 as [0,6,0,...] (expected [0,2,0,...]), and similar in other even/odd rows, suggesting vertical extension from 6's in col 1 overwrote or conflicted incorrectly with 2's pattern (alternating 2's every other row in cols 1,5,13); horizontal pass may not have corrected it, indicating order or conflict resolution bug.
 * The vertical-first-then-horizontal order worked for train 2 but caused overpropagation in train 1/3 (e.g., vertical fills create unintended horizontal pairs).
 * No separate object extraction function; the inline pos_by_c grouping is helpful but could be extracted for reuse to avoid re-scanning grid multiple times.
 * Conflict handling (propagating new_c to chain_set) is partially correct but over-applies in non-conflict paths (fills 0s only, but in examples it wrongly fills where no extension should occur).
 * The potential_up/down/left/right list generation via while loop is accurate for arithmetic sequences but misses if multiple chains overlap or if d varies.
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the entire program is brittle to order (vertical before horizontal) and doesn't re-scan for new pairs after fills, leading to incomplete propagation in complex grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial fills like row 1 with isolated 7,2,6; row 2 all 9's (possibly a full horizontal line not extended vertically); row 3 with 6,2,6 at ends; row 5 with spaced 6's and a 1; row 7 spaced 8's; row 8 alternating 7's with a 4 anomaly. This suggests over-extension vertically (e.g., 6's in col 0 rows 0-8? but row 0 all 0s) and horizontal (9's in row 2), but mismatches expected patterns—inferred rules from training suggest vertical 6's in col 20 should extend upward/downward by d from pairs (e.g., row3 col20=6, row5 col20=6 implies d=2, filling row1/7 col20 with 6 if empty, but generated row1 col20=6 correctly? wait, listing cuts off); however, the 4 in row8 col7 looks like an unhandled conflict or input remnant, and spaced 7's in row8 didn't extend left/right fully (e.g., d=2 from positions, but stops prematurely). It fails to propagate 9's vertically from row2 (expected to fill above/below if pairs form), and isolated 2 in row1 col17 suggests missed horizontal pair with row3 col19=2 (d= something, but not extended). Overall, looks like partial understanding: some chains filled (e.g., 8's in row7), but conflicts mishandled (4 not assimilated), and order causes incomplete test grid completion—does not match mentally simulated rules (e.g., full vertical 6 chain in col0/5/10/15/20 should fill all rows if d=1 pairs detected, but generated sparsely).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-completion puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with 0s as empty cells and positive integers as colors) must be filled by detecting and extending arithmetic progression patterns of the same color in rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical), using the GCD of position differences to determine the period and fill matching positions. The approach switches between row-wise and column-wise processing based on grid dimensions (taller grids prioritize horizontal, wider prioritize vertical), and handles both uniform-color patterns and mixed overrides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on 1-indexed positions; only consider non-zero cells for computing differences and GCD, and fill only empty (0) cells or reinforce existing matches without overwriting mismatches.
 * For uniform colors in a row/column, compute GCD of sorted position differences, then fill every position congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, extending beyond observed positions if possible.
 * For mixed colors, first group by color and apply per-color filling (without overriding existing different colors), then optionally override sparse mixed patterns by filling with the color at the minimum position if the observed points exactly match the expected count for the span.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > columns, prioritize horizontal completion; else, do vertical per-color then mixed override— this prevents overfilling in non-dominant directions.
 * Subtlety: In mixed vertical cases, the override only applies if the number of observed points equals the expected in the arithmetic sequence span, to avoid hallucinating dense patterns; also, filling stops at grid bounds.
 * Easy to miss: GCD computation ignores empty lists (defaults to 1, but skips if <2 points); per-color vertical filling allows reinforcing but not overwriting conflicting colors; horizontal assumes all same color for full periodic fill, but vertical mixed uses min-color override only under strict conditions.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), considerations include deep-copying grids to avoid mutation, sorting positions, and handling edge cases like single points (skip) or full spans.
 * Potential overreach: The mixed override might incorrectly fill if GCD leads to exact match count but wrong color propagation; test grids may have overlapping row/column constraints that require sequential application without conflicts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD of differences; essential for period detection and used in all pattern extensions.)

```python
def horizontal_completion(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for i in range(num_rows):
        row = grid[i]
        pos_color = [(j + 1, row[j]) for j in range(num_cols) if row[j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        all_same = all(c == colors[0] for c in colors)
        if all_same:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            r = poss[0] % d
            c = colors[0]
            for jj in range(1, num_cols + 1):
                if jj % d == r:
                    row[jj - 1] = c
        else:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            min_p = poss[0]
            max_p = poss[-1]
            color_max = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == max_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                row[current - 1][j] = color_max  # Note: Bug here, should be row[current - 1] = color_max? Wait, no, this is horizontal but code has row[jj-1], but in else it's incomplete.
    return grid
```
(This function works for uniform horizontal but has a bug in the mixed else branch: it sets row[current - 1][j] which assumes vertical indexing; it's unhelpful as-is for mixed horizontal and should be avoided or fixed. The uniform part is helpful.)

(This is helpful for per-color vertical filling without conflicts; key for mixed columns where colors are grouped separately.)

        min_p = poss[0]
        max_p = poss[-1]

        if num_exp == k:
            color_min = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                grid[current - 1][j] = color_min
    return grid
```
(This is conditionally helpful for overriding mixed verticals under exact-span conditions, but may overfill if not all points are intended; useful for sparse tests but risky.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly handles training examples 1-3 by applying orientation-based processing and GCD patterns.
 * Missed full horizontal mixed handling: the else branch in horizontal_completion has a indexing bug (uses [j] but j undefined, likely copy-paste error from vertical), leading to no-op or crash in mixed rows.
 * Vertical mixed override uses min-color fill, but in some cases (e.g., test) it might need max or average; unknown why it underfills test.
 * Per-color vertical is essential for avoiding color conflicts in mixed columns, and it worked for training.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components); this puzzle is purely positional arithmetic, not blob-based, so object extraction would be unhelpful or broken.
 * Training successes suggest core GCD and uniform filling works, but test failure indicates subtlety in mixed or orientation for irregular grids.
 * The program function's orientation switch (rows > cols for horizontal) is key but may fail if test grid is square-ish or has cross-patterns needing both directions iteratively.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 21-column grid (inferred from row lengths) that remains extremely sparse, with only scattered numbers like 7s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 1s, 8s, 4s in positions matching the input (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 10, 2 at col 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at col 7, 5s at 20-21), and vast zeros elsewhere—no evident filling occurred beyond input.
 * This does not look correct: Expected output should show periodic extensions, e.g., the two 2s in row 2 (positions ~18 and 21, diff 3) might GCD to 3 and fill every 3rd position with 2 horizontally, but nothing is added; similarly, vertical 5s in col 20 (rows 3-4) should extend downward if uniform, but no change.
 * Underfilling suggests the program skipped most cases: likely because test grid has few lines with >=2 same-color points (many singles or mixed without exact span), and the horizontal mixed bug prevented any row fills; vertical per-color/mixed only touched columns with multiples but didn't propagate due to short spans or conflicts.
 * Differences from expected: No arithmetic fills visible (e.g., col 21 has 2,5,2,?,6,? which mixes colors without GCD match, so skipped correctly? But test likely needs more aggressive extension); output matches input almost exactly, implying no meaningful completion—probably wrong as puzzles expect denser grids.
 * To handle test, need bug fix in horizontal mixed, perhaps iterative row-col passes, or looser override conditions (e.g., fill if num_exp >= k).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or values) where the goal is to complete partially filled rows and columns by extending patterns, primarily arithmetic progressions of non-zero values into zero positions, with different handling for horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) directions based on grid dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify non-zero positions (S) in a line (row or column); if fewer than 2, no filling occurs.
 * For perfect arithmetic progressions (all differences equal), extend forward and backward from the starting position using the common difference d, overwriting zeros but not existing values (in vertical case, it checks if out[pos] == 0).
 * If not a perfect AP in horizontal (non-vertical), compute GCD of all differences and fill every GCD steps from start to end using the last non-zero value c.
 * In vertical (columns), handle per color separately: for each color's positions, check if they form a perfect AP and extend only into zeros if it's a perfect AP for that color.
 * Grid orientation matters: if more rows than columns, process rows horizontally; else, process columns vertically and reconstruct the grid.
 * Subtlety: Vertical processing groups by color and only extends perfect APs per color, avoiding overwriting; horizontal non-AP uses GCD filling with last value, which may not align with per-color logic.
 * Easy to miss: No filling if single non-zero or no pattern; GCD filling is only for horizontal non-AP and uses last value, not first or average; vertical doesn't use GCD, sticking to per-color perfect APs.
 * Considerations: Potential overwriting issues (code avoids in vertical but not explicitly in horizontal AP); assumes grid is rectangular; numbers are colors, so same number = same pattern group.

(Note: These are the core functions from the attempt; they handle line processing and grid orientation. No additional types like classes were used, but List[List[int]] for grid is implicit.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1, 2, and 3, demonstrating understanding of AP extension in both directions and GCD-based filling for horizontal non-AP cases.
 * Worked well for perfect APs by extending with constant value from start position.
 * Vertical per-color AP detection and zero-only filling avoided conflicts effectively in training cases.
 * Did not work fully for the test input: generated output shows heavy filling of 5's in what appears to be column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 have 5 in position 19, and some extras like row 2 has two 5's, row 3 has 5 and 2), but leaves most of the grid as zeros, suggesting incomplete pattern detection (e.g., no horizontal fillings observed, and vertical fillings seem biased toward 5's without addressing other colors like 7,2,6, etc., properly).
 * GCD filling in horizontal non-AP is limited to range S[0] to S[-1] and uses last value, which may miss extensions beyond the observed non-zeros or use wrong color in multi-color lines.
 * Vertical processing only extends perfect APs per color but ignores non-AP colors entirely, potentially missing GCD-like logic for vertical non-AP (asymmetry with horizontal).
 * No extraction functions for objects like "blobs" or connected components were used or needed; the line-based approach fits the pattern-extension puzzle but may overlook diagonal or multi-line interactions.
 * Function process_line is helpful and core to the solution, correctly copying existing non-zeros to output.
 * Overall, demonstrates core AP and GCD understanding but incomplete for test due to unhandled cases like mixed colors in vertical or non-extending beyond bounds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 9x21 grid (incomplete last row), with most positions still 0, but noticeable vertical fillings of 5's in column 19 across rows 0-8 (e.g., [...,5] in row 0, [...,5,2] in row 1, [...,5,5] in row 2, etc.), and some extras like 2 in row 1 col 20, 5 in row 3 col 20? Wait, formatting suggests column 19 is mostly 5's, column 20 has mixed 0,2,5,2,0,6,0,8,7.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely fill more patterns, such as horizontal APs (e.g., the 5's in column 19 suggest a vertical AP of 5's every 1 row, but code's vertical processing should catch that if perfect AP; however, other elements like the 7 in row 1 col 9, 9 in row 2 col 6, 6 in row 3 col 3, etc., seem unextended, leaving isolated non-zeros without filling nearby zeros).
 * Missing horizontal extensions entirely (e.g., row 6 has 1 at col 13 and 6 at col 15, diff=2, but no filling shown; if AP, should extend).
 * Bias toward filling 5's suggests the per-color vertical logic caught a strong AP for 5 (positions in col 19? Wait, no—the input isn't shown, but output implies input had 5's in col 19 at intervals, extended fully), but ignored or failed on other colors like 2 (appears in row 1 col 17 and 20, row 3 col 20, row 7 col 17, row 8 col 18? Not extended consistently).
 * Looks incomplete because ~90% zeros remain, whereas expected should propagate patterns more aggressively (e.g., if vertical since 9 rows < 21 cols? Code would process columns vertically, but output shows uneven filling, possibly missing GCD for non-AP columns).
 * Subtle difference: In row 8, ends with 5,7—may have partially filled a pattern, but unclear if correct without input; overall, does not match a "completed" puzzle grid, as patterns like the diagonal-ish 2's or scattered numbers aren't resolved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to extend or complete patterns in rows and columns of a numerical grid (likely representing colors or values) based on detected arithmetic progressions, common differences, or GCD-based spacing, prioritizing horizontal fills in wider grids and vertical in taller ones, while handling multiple "colors" separately in vertical processing to avoid overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are only extended if there are at least two non-zero values in a line to establish a difference (arithmetic progression check fails for single points or no points).
 * For horizontal (non-vertical) processing, if not a perfect AP, fall back to GCD of differences to fill from start to end with the last value's color, but only within the span of existing points—do not extrapolate beyond.
 * Vertical processing handles per-color APs separately, filling empty spots without overwriting existing values, and extends both forward and backward, but only if a perfect AP is detected per color.
 * Grid orientation matters: process rows if more rows than columns (tall grid), columns if more columns than rows (wide grid)—this avoids redundant processing.
 * Subtlety: Extensions in vertical mode check for empty (0) spots only when filling to avoid conflicts, but horizontal GCD mode unconditionally fills within span, potentially overwriting (though input likely has no conflicts).
 * Easy to miss: GCD fallback is horizontal-only and uses the last value's color, not the first; vertical per-color filling can create overlapping patterns but respects existing values.
 * No diagonal or multi-line interactions; purely per-row or per-column.
 * Zeros are placeholders to fill; non-zeros are fixed clues.
 * Potential edge cases: All zeros (no fill), single non-zero (no extension), irregular spacing (GCD approximates), multiple colors in one line (vertical splits them).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict
from math import gcd

def process_line(line: List[int], n: int, is_vertical: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-zero positions S, checks for perfect AP with common diff d.
    # If AP: extends forward/backward from first position using d and first value c.
    # Non-AP horizontal: computes GCD of diffs, fills from first to last pos with last value c using GCD step.
    # Vertical non-AP: groups by color, checks AP per color, extends per color without overwriting.
    # Returns filled line with zeros replaced where patterns match.
    out = [0] * n
    # ... (full implementation as in the provided program)
    return out
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Determines orientation: rows if tall, columns if wide.
    # Applies process_line to each row or extracted column.
    # Reconstructs output grid.
    # Handles empty grid edge case.
    # ... (full implementation as in the provided program)
    return out_g  # or processed rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly extending APs and GCD patterns without overfills or misses.
 * The attempt demonstrates understanding of orientation-based processing (rows vs. columns) and per-color handling in vertical mode, which likely passed trainings by filling sparse patterns accurately.
 * However, the GCD fallback in horizontal mode is limited to the span of existing points (S[0] to S[-1]), which might miss full-line extensions if the puzzle expects extrapolation beyond clues.
 * Vertical mode's per-color AP is helpful but only activates if perfect AP per color; irregular multi-color lines may leave zeros unfilled.
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components or blobs) is present, but it's not needed—line-based processing suffices; adding blob detection would be unhelpful and overcomplicate.
 * The `process_line` function is core and helpful, correctly isolating non-zeros and diffs; retain and refine it.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; the gcd import and Dict for pos_by_color are relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid but leaves many zeros, with extensions like repeated 5's in column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 all get 5? Wait, shown lines suggest vertical fills for 5's in col 19/20, but inconsistent: line 0 has 5 at pos19, line1 has 5 at20 and2 at20? Output shows incomplete patterns.
 * It does not look fully correct: For example, in row 1 (second line), there's a 7 at pos9, 2 at17, 5 at19,2 at20— if horizontal processing, GCD of diffs might not fill between them properly, leaving zeros; vertical for col9 should extend the 7 if AP, but output shows only isolated 7s without clear extension (e.g., row2 col6 has9, not related).
 * Observed effects: Heavy filling of 5's in later columns (e.g., col19/20 across rows), likely from vertical AP detection for color5, but misses horizontal patterns like potential AP in row5 (1 at13,6 at15—diff2, could extend but doesn't). Also, row7 has2 at17,8 at20, but no fill between. Differs from expected by under-filling horizontals (e.g., row3:6 at3, then zeros until5 at19—GCD fallback should fill some but span-limited). Row8:4 at7,7 at18,5 at19,7 at20—multi-color, vertical might split but output shows no extensions. Unknown why some isolates like row2's9 at6 aren't extended, possibly no AP partner.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (some vertical 5-chains look extended correctly) but is incomplete, missing horizontal GCD fills and potential bi-directional extensions beyond spans, suggesting the program under-extends in non-perfect AP cases.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero-valued cells (empty spaces) by propagating colors from existing non-zero patterns, either horizontally or vertically depending on the grid's aspect ratio (taller grids horizontal, wider vertical). The propagation follows arithmetic sequences based on distances between paired identical colors, extending through zeros while adapting to encountered colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify pairs of identical non-zero colors in a line (row or column); if more or fewer than two occurrences, skip that color.
 * Compute the distance d between the pair's positions, then extend the pattern bidirectionally: fill zeros with the current color, continue with same color if matched, or switch to a new color if a different non-zero is hit and include that position.
 * Choose direction based on grid shape: horizontal propagation for h > w (row-wise), vertical for h <= w (column-wise); this ensures the longer dimension is processed first.
 * Extension stops at grid boundaries or when no further progress is possible (e.g., non-extendable non-zero without matching pattern).
 * Subtlety: Propagation can chain colors (e.g., hitting a different color changes the propagating color for further extension), but only for exactly two initial positions per color; multiple pairs or singles are ignored.
 * Zeros are placeholders to fill but not initiators; non-zeros must form the seed pairs.
 * Potential miss: Over-extension if d=0 (same position, but code assumes distinct); or failure to handle sparse grids where pairs are far apart.
 * In vertical mode, transpose logic by processing columns as lists.
 * All changes are in-place on a copied grid to avoid side effects.
 * Edge case: Empty grid or single row/column returns unchanged; colors >9 or negatives unhandled (assume 1-9 positives).

    pass  # (as in code; decides orientation based on dimensions)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly identifying pairs and propagating through zeros with color adaptation.
 * Worked well for dense patterns in training where pairs had clear distances and extensions filled expected zeros without overreaching.
 * Did not work for the test input: propagation seems incomplete, as the output remains mostly zeros with only isolated numbers (e.g., 7,2,6 in row 1; 9,5,5 in row 2), suggesting failures to detect pairs, compute proper d, or extend chains across the sparse 21x9 grid.
 * Code assumes exactly two positions per color to start; test may have colors with 1 or >2 instances, causing skips and under-filling.
 * Extension logic breaks early on non-matching non-zeros without including them fully, leading to partial fills (e.g., row 8 has 8s but no extension visible).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components or blobs) was attempted, but it's not needed here—propagation is linear, not blob-based; future attempts should avoid blob extraction as irrelevant.
 * The orientation choice (h > w) worked for training but may mismatch test if grid is square-ish (21 rows? output shows 9 lines, perhaps test is wider).
 * Function `transform_line` is helpful and core but buggy in test: likely misses multi-pair colors or zero-d distances.
 * No unhelpful functions noted beyond potential overcomplication with defaultdict (but it's fine).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows a 9-row grid (possibly truncated from 21?) with vast majority zeros and only scattered single or paired numbers (e.g., row 1: 7 at col9, 2 at col17, 6 at col20; row 2: 9 at col6, 5s at col19-20), indicating minimal propagation occurred.
 * Expected more filling: test input (inferred from output patterns) likely has seed numbers like 6s, 2s, 7s, 5s, 9s, 1s, 8s, 4s that should pair and extend across rows/columns, filling long zero stretches (e.g., row 0 all zeros suggests no vertical propagation hit it).
 * Differences from expected: Output ignores potential vertical pairs (e.g., 6 in row3 col3 and row5 col15? no fill between); horizontal extensions stalled (e.g., two 5s in row2 col19-20 should extend left/right with d=1, but nothing added). This is different because training succeeded on similar propagations—test sparsity or >2 instances per color likely broke pair detection.
 * No chaining observed (e.g., 7 in row1 col9 and row8 col17? no vertical fill), so output under-fills dramatically compared to a correct solution that should densely populate based on arithmetic extensions.
 * Looks incorrect overall: too sparse, no evidence of bidirectional extension or color switches, failing to transform the grid meaningfully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a sparse grid of numbered cells (representing colors) where the task is to fill in the blank cells (0s) by extending arithmetic progression patterns either horizontally across rows or vertically down columns, determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of position differences for placed colors. The direction of processing (horizontal if more rows than columns, vertical otherwise) suggests the puzzle adapts to grid aspect ratio, with rules prioritizing uniform color extensions, per-color independent fillings, and overrides for mixed-color cases to avoid conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on positions (1-indexed) of non-zero cells; compute differences between consecutive positions of the same color (or all positions if uniform), then use GCD as the step size (d) to extend fillings starting from the first position's residue (r = pos[0] % d).
 * For uniform colors in a line (row or column), fill every d steps across the entire length if the pattern is consistent; for mixed colors, limit filling to the span between min and max positions to avoid over-extension.
 * Per-color processing is crucial for vertical cases: treat each color independently to extend its own AP without interfering with others initially, only overriding zeros or matching cells.
 * Mixed-color overrides should check if the number of expected positions in the AP equals the number of actual placements (indicating a sparse uniform fill disguised as mixed), then fill the span with the starting color; this handles cases where multiple colors appear but follow a single underlying pattern.
 * Direction decision (horizontal if num_rows > num_cols, else vertical) is key, but vertical processing requires two passes: per-color extension first (to build independent patterns), then mixed override (to unify sparse cases).
 * Subtle edge cases: single or zero placements do nothing; GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1 (but skipped); avoid overwriting existing non-matching cells in per-color extensions; positions must be sorted for diff calculation.
 * Grid is list of lists, output must be deep copy to avoid mutating input; assume rectangular grid with consistent lengths.
 * Potential for conflicts in vertical mixed cases: if after per-color, a column has interleaved colors, the mixed override may not trigger correctly if num_exp != k due to partial fills.

                    out[p - 1] = cc
    return out
```
(This function is helpful for independent color extensions in vertical processing; it groups positions by color, computes per-color GCD/AP, and fills safely without overwriting mismatches—essential for handling multi-color columns.)

```python
def mixed_override_line(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_color = [(i + 1, line[i]) for i in range(length) if line[i] != 0]
    k = len(pos_color)
    if k < 2:
        return out
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
    colors_set = set(colors)
    if len(colors_set) <= 1:
        return out
    diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    min_p = poss[0]
    max_p = poss[-1]
    num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
    if num_exp == k:
        c = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
        current = min_p
        while current <= max_p:
            out[current - 1] = c
            current += d
    return out
```
(This is useful for detecting and unifying sparse uniform patterns in mixed-color lines; it checks if placements exactly match an AP count, then overrides the span with the starting color—key for subtle uniform fills.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of GCD-based AP extensions and direction-based processing (horizontal for tall grids, vertical with per-color then mixed for wide grids).
 * The process_horizontal function worked well for uniform or endpoint-driven fills in rows, but may not be triggered in test (likely wide grid, so vertical path used).
 * Per_color_extension successfully built independent patterns in training vertical cases without conflicts.
 * Mixed_override_line correctly unified sparse cases in training, but in test, it may not have triggered enough due to post-per-color state not matching num_exp == k condition precisely.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level structures attempted; the code focuses on line-by-line processing, which aligns with puzzle but misses potential grid-wide pattern interactions (e.g., if patterns align across lines).
 * No unhelpful functions introduced; all provided (compute_gcd, process_horizontal, per_color_extension, mixed_override_line) are relevant, though process_horizontal's "else" branch (filling with max color) might over-simplify mixed horizontal cases compared to vertical's per-color approach.
 * Overall, core AP/GCD logic is strong, but vertical mixed override may need refinement for partial fills or interleaved colors after per-color step.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal filling: e.g., row 2 has 7 at column 10, 2s at 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at 7, 5s at 20-21; row 4 has 6 at 4, 5 at 20, 2 at 21; row 6 has 1 at 14, 6s at 16 and 21; row 8 has 2 at 18, 8 at 21; row 9 has 4 at 8, 7s at 19 and 21—mostly preserving input placements with little extension (many rows/columns remain all zeros).
 * This does not look correct; expected output should have more extensive fillings based on AP extensions (e.g., if test grid has vertical patterns like color 2 in column 21 across rows 2,4,?, it should fill gaps with step d from GCD), but output lacks such completions, suggesting per_color_extension or mixed_override didn't propagate far enough (possibly due to insufficient placements per color to trigger GCD>1, or override not activating on post-per-color state).
 * Zeros dominate (e.g., entire row 1 and 5,7), indicating no horizontal processing (consistent with wide grid assumption) and incomplete vertical extensions; for instance, column 21 has multiple 2/5/6/8/7 but no apparent filling between them, differing from expected unified AP if they share a residue.
 * The output makes partial sense for preserving input but fails to demonstrate full pattern extension, likely missing subtle rule for extending beyond min-max in per-color if AP is global, or handling colors with only one placement (which skips but might need propagation from adjacent lines—though puzzle seems line-independent).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a partially filled grid where numbers represent colors, and the goal is to extend patterns in rows or columns based on arithmetic progressions derived from the positions of existing colors, using GCD to determine periodicity and fill zeros accordingly, while handling uniform vs. mixed color cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extended either horizontally (per row) or vertically (per column), decided by comparing num_rows > num_cols; this orientation choice is crucial and may need flexibility if the grid is square.
 * For uniform colors in a line, compute GCD of position differences, then fill all positions congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, potentially across the entire line.
 * For mixed colors, handle per-color extensions (extending each color's own progression independently, overwriting zeros or matching values) before attempting overrides; overrides only apply if the number of expected positions matches the given ones exactly, using the starting color to fill the progression.
 * Subtlety: Positions are 1-indexed in calculations (e.g., i+1), and extensions stop at the line length; avoid overwriting existing non-matching colors in per-color extensions.
 * Key: If fewer than 2 positions per color/group, no extension; empty lines or singletons remain unchanged.
 * Consideration: GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1, but lines with no colors stay all zeros; mixed overrides only trigger for exact progression matches to avoid overfilling.
 * Easy to miss: In mixed horizontal extensions, it uses the last sorted color (potentially incorrect—should it be the first or majority?); column processing chains per-color then override, which may conflict in dense grids.
 * Overall: Prioritize uniform extensions; for mixed, per-color is safer than full overrides to prevent bleeding colors incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is useful for finding common differences in positions.)

```python
def is_uniform(pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not pos_color:
        return True
    c0 = pos_color[0][1]
    return all(c == c0 for _, c in pos_color)
```
(This checks if all given colors in positions are the same, key for deciding uniform vs. mixed handling.)

```python
def extend_uniform(line: List[int], pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    diffs = [poss[i + 1] - poss[i] for i in range(len(poss) - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    r = poss[0] % d
    c = pos_color[0][1]
    n = len(line)
    out = line[:]
    for p in range(1, n + 1):
        if p % d == r:
            out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This correctly extends a uniform color across the full line using modulo residue, a core mechanic.)

```python
def per_color_extension(line: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_by_color: dict[int, List[int]] = {}
    for i in range(n):
        c = line[i]
        if c != 0:
            if c not in pos_by_color:
                pos_by_color[c] = []
            pos_by_color[c].append(i + 1)
    for c, group_poss in pos_by_color.items():
        group_k = len(group_poss)
        if group_k < 2:
            continue
        group_poss = sorted(group_poss)
        group_diffs = [group_poss[m + 1] - group_poss[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
        group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
        group_r = group_poss[0] % group_d
        for p in range(1, n + 1):
            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == c:
                    out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This is essential for handling mixed colors by extending each independently without aggressive overwriting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) successfully passed all three training examples, indicating strong handling of uniform and basic mixed extensions in rows/columns.
 * Worked: GCD-based periodicity correctly extends uniforms across full lines; per-color extension avoids conflicts in mixed cases; orientation logic (rows if taller) works for training grids.
 * Did not work: In the test, many rows/columns remain mostly zeros (e.g., row 0 all zeros, row 4 all zeros), suggesting no extension triggered despite potential patterns—possibly due to <2 positions per group or mixed override failing when num_exp != k.
 * Problem understanding: The puzzle involves filling a sparse grid by extrapolating color progressions, but this attempt assumes full-line extensions for uniforms and cautious per-color for mixed; it may miss cases where mixed overrides should propagate a dominant color or where vertical processing needs row-wise checks first.
 * extract_objects not present or needed—no object extraction here; puzzle is line-based, not blob/object-oriented.
 * Function `extend_mixed_horizontal` is somewhat broken/not fully helpful: It always uses the last sorted color for filling, which ignores mixed nature and may overwrite incorrectly; only fills between min/max, not full line—use sparingly or fix to select starting color properly.
 * Function `mixed_override` is conditionally helpful but restrictive: Only fills if exact match on expected positions, leaving many zeros in test (e.g., row 1 has 7 at 10, 2s at 18/20—GCD=2? but no full extension); good for avoiding overfill but may underfill test cases with partial progressions.
 * process_row/process_column chain per-color then override, which worked for training but likely under-extends test columns (e.g., column 19 has 5,5,2 in rows 2-4, but no visible vertical fill).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it shows partial fills (e.g., row 1: isolated 7 at pos 10, 2s at 18/20 but no further extension like every 8? positions if GCD=8), leaving most of the 21x9? grid as zeros, which suggests under-extension compared to expected full pattern completion.
 * Row 0 all zeros: Expected some fill if input had implicit patterns or if orientation was wrong—output unchanged, indicating no positions triggered extension.
 * Row 2: 9 at pos7, 5s at 20/21—GCD=13? but no extension between/around; looks incorrect as it should fill progression if uniform/mixed per color.
 * Row 3: 6 at4, 5 at20, 2 at21—mixed, per-color should extend 6's singleton (none) and 5/2 (none since adjacent), but zeros dominate; different from expected by not filling any arithmetic sequence.
 * Vertical: e.g., column 20 has 2 (row1),5(row2),2(row3),6(row5)—mixed, but output shows no vertical fills, likely because num_rows=9 > num_cols=21? Wait, 9<21 so processes columns, but result has sparse fills only where input had them—underfilled, missing expected GCD extensions like for 2s or 5s.
 * Overall, test output is too sparse (mostly zeros, only input positions filled, no visible extensions beyond originals); expected denser grid with propagated colors (e.g., row 7: 2 at18,8 at21—no fill; row 8:4 at8,7 at19/21—should extend 7 every 2? but doesn't). This differs by lacking progression fills, possibly due to strict <2 or exact-match conditions blocking valid partial patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (colors) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (0s) based on detected arithmetic patterns in rows (horizontal mode) or columns (vertical mode), using GCD to identify common differences among positions of matching colors, and then propagating the color forward or based on majority/last occurrence rules. The mode switches based on whether rows outnumber columns, and filling prioritizes same-color groups or extends to the maximum position with the dominant color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Determine processing mode by comparing num_rows > num_cols (horizontal, process rows left-to-right) vs. otherwise (vertical, process columns bottom-to-top, with positions inverted as p = num_rows - 1 - ii).
 * For a starting color c at position 0 (or bottom in vertical), find all positions with c, compute GCD d of those positions (skip if d==0 or <=1 positions).
 * Candidates are positions k where k % d == r (r = first_pos % d), but only up to grid bounds.
 * If all candidate colors match c, fill all candidates with c; else, find max_pos among colored candidates, use its color as fill_color, and fill only up to <= max_pos.
 * Skip rows/columns if starting cell is 0 or no valid group_colors.
 * Vertical mode inverts row indices for position calculations (p increases upward from bottom), ensuring bottom-up processing.
 * GCD handles irregular spacing but assumes positions are integers starting from 0.
 * Output is a copy of input with only fills applied; unchanged 0s remain.
 * Subtle: In non-same color case, filling stops at max_pos to avoid overextending mismatched patterns; in vertical, candidates_p range to max_p = num_rows-1.
 * Easy to miss: Positions list must be built from actual g[i][j] == c, not output; d computed only on those positions, not all candidates.
 * Grids may be rectangular (rows != cols), and empty/sparse grids return empty.
 * No diagonal or multi-direction processing; strictly row or column based on mode.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from math import gcd
from typing import List

# Core program function as provided; it's the main tool for processing.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (full code as in attempt; handles mode detection, GCD computation, candidate filling)
    pass

# Implicit helper: Position finder for a color in row/col.
# Example extraction (not in code but useful for debugging):
def find_positions_in_row(g: List[List[int]], row_idx: int, color: int, num_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(num_cols) if g[row_idx][j] == color]

# Similar for column (adapt for vertical):
def find_positions_in_col(g: List[List[int]], col_idx: int, color: int, num_rows: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num_rows - 1 - i for i in range(num_rows) if g[i][col_idx] == color]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1-3 completely (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of mode switching, GCD-based pattern detection, and conditional filling rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and fills arithmetic progression patterns with same-color propagation or max_pos-limited extension; vertical mode inversion works for bottom-up processing; skips invalid cases (d=0, no positions, empty groups).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the generated output shows partial filling (e.g., isolated colors like 7 at (1,9), 2s at (1,17/20), 9 at (2,6), 5s at (2,19/20), 6 at (3,3), 2s at (3,19/20), 1 at (5,13), 6s at (5,15/20), 8s at (7,17/20), 4 at (8,7), 7s at (8,18/20)), but many rows remain mostly empty (e.g., rows 0,4,6 all 0s, row 8 incomplete), suggesting possible under-filling or missed patterns in sparse areas.
 * The attempt correctly copies the input grid and only modifies via fills, preserving unchanged 0s.
 * No unhelpful functions; the core program is relevant and mostly functional, but lacks explicit handling for edge cases like all-zero rows/cols or non-starting patterns (assumes start at 0/bottom).
 * Subtle issue: In test, filling seems to stop prematurely (e.g., no extension beyond visible max_pos in some rows), possibly due to candidate filtering or GCD=1 leading to over-broad but under-colored candidates; unknown if this mismatches expected full patterns.
 * Training successes imply core GCD and mode logic is right, but test may need tweaks for sparser grids or multiple overlapping groups per row/col.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x21 grid (inferred from row lengths), with fills applied to some cells but leaving large empty areas (e.g., entire columns 0-5 mostly 0 except scattered; rows 0,4,6 all 0s), which may indicate incomplete pattern detection rather than a fully solved puzzle.
 * Specific effects: Row 1 fills 7 (col9), 2s (cols17,20) – possibly from a GCD pattern starting elsewhere, but no fill between 9-17 suggests d>1 or mismatched colors; row 2 has 9 (col6) isolated, 5s at end (19/20) – looks like short extension, but why not more candidates?; row 3 similar with 6 (col3) and 2s at end; row 5 has 1 (col13), 6s (15/20) – pattern detected but gaps (cols14,16 empty); row 7: 8s at end; row 8: 4 (col7), 7s at end – consistent with max_pos rule but potentially missing leftward fills if patterns start non-zero.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely have more contiguous fills (e.g., extending 5s or 2s leftward if GCD allows), as training successes suggest complete pattern resolution; here, many 0s persist where arithmetic extensions seem plausible (e.g., col20 has vertical 2-5-2-?-?-6-?-8-7 pattern, but vertical mode might underfill if bottom !=c or d invalid). Unknown exact expected grid, but sparsity suggests program missed some starting c's or over-skipped due to len(positions)<=1.
 * Positive: Fills match visible input hints (assuming input had these seeds), and no overfills (e.g., no coloring outside patterns); makes partial sense for sparse test but likely incomplete for a "solved" puzzle.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the train inputs/outputs (1-3), the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all** train examples. These are limited to properties that demonstrably affect or transform other elements (e.g., position, color, size via pixels/bbox expansion, or addition of new elements) in every case where the condition applies. Only consistent patterns are included—no assumptions about puzzle-wide rules, no irrelevant isolated elements (e.g., singleton blocks with no multiples in row/column that remain unchanged are excluded as they show no interaction), and no forced connections. Transformations that cannot be directly tied to an obvious property link are noted as unknown. Test inputs are not analyzed, as consistency is required across train examples only.

#### 1. **Same-Color Blocks in the Same Column (Vertical Interaction)**
   - **Description**: When multiple blocks of the **same color** share a column (x-coordinate fixed, varying y), they consistently interact to form or expand a single vertical structure. This occurs in train2 (e.g., Greens at x=9 y=7-8) and train3 (e.g., Reds at x=5 y=5-6; Reds at x=1 y=4 & y=6; Reds at x=13 y=3 & y=6; Pinks at x=9 y=5-6). No such vertical same-color multiples in train1, so consistent where present.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (y-coordinates) → Size/bbox Expansion**: The y-range of the group expands upward (toward y=0) to fill from y=0 to the maximum y in the group or grid height. Examples:
       - Train2: Input y=7-8 → Output bbox y=0-8 (pixels from 2 → 9).
       - Train3: Input y=5-6 → Output y=0-6 (pixels from 2 → 7); spaced y=4 & y=6 → No merge but adds new block at y=0 (pixels=1 added); spaced y=3 & y=6 → Adds new block at y=0 (pixels=1 added).
     - **Position (y-coordinates) → Addition of New Blocks**: New same-color blocks (pixels=1) are added in the same column at specific y-positions (often y=0 or to fill gaps toward y=0), but exact placement pattern (e.g., every N units or parity) is unknown—consistent addition occurs but transformation details unclear.
       - Train3: Adds Red at x=1 y=0 & y=2 (from spaced y=4 & y=6); adds Red at x=13 y=0 (from spaced y=3 & y=6).
       - Train2: No additions for the vertical Green group, but see mixed-color below for related column additions.
     - **No Color Change**: Same-color vertical groups never change color; they unify/expand as the original color.
   - **Unknowns**: Why some gaps are filled with additions vs. full expansion (e.g., train3 x=1 adds discrete y=0 & y=2 but not full merge; train2 x=9 full merges). No horizontal spread from these vertical groups.

#### 2. **Different-Color Blocks in the Same Column (Vertical Color Propagation)**
   - **Description**: When blocks of **different colors** share a column, the color of one propagates to change others in the column. This occurs in train2 (e.g., x=2: Yellow at y=2 with Greens at y=5 & y=8). Train3 has no mixed-color columns with multiples. Train1 has no column multiples at all. Consistent where mixed vertical multiples appear.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (y-coordinate relative to others) → Color Change**: The color of the topmost (lowest y) block in the column propagates downward to overwrite lower blocks' colors.
       - Train2: Top Yellow (y=2) changes lower Greens (y=5 & y=8) to Yellow. Positions stay the same, but color unifies to top block's color.
     - **No Size/bbox Change or Merging**: Changed blocks remain same size (pixels=1); no expansion or addition directly from this interaction (though see same-color vertical for related additions in other columns).
   - **Unknowns**: Propagation is downward only (no upward changes observed); why not full column unification if more mixed examples existed. No similar propagation in rows (see below).

#### 3. **Same-Color Blocks in the Same Row (Horizontal Interaction)**
   - **Description**: When multiple blocks of the **same color** share a row (y-coordinate fixed, varying x), they interact to expand or add in the row. This occurs in train1 (e.g., y=1: Blues at x=0 & x=3; y=4: Blues at x=0-1 adjacent; y=11: Maroon at x=0-1 with Green at x=7—note Maroon treated as compatible with Green for expansion, but see mixed below). No same-color row multiples in train2 or train3 (train3 y=6 has spaced Reds but treated as column interaction priority). Consistent where present without column conflicts.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (x-coordinates) → Size/bbox Expansion**: The x-range expands to fill the row horizontally (from min x to max x or full grid width), merging into one block.
       - Train1: y=4 adjacent Blues x=0-1 (pixels=2) → Full row bbox x=0-8 (pixels=9); y=11 Maroon x=0-1 + Green x=7 (pixels=2+1) → Full row Green x=0-7 (pixels=8).
     - **Position (x-coordinates) → Addition of New Blocks**: New same-color blocks (pixels=1) added in the row to extend the pattern (e.g., arithmetic progression in x).
       - Train1: y=1 Blues at x=0 & x=3 → Adds Blue at x=6 (extends every 3 units).
   - **Unknowns**: Expansion width (e.g., to x=8 vs. x=7) varies; exact addition spacing unknown (consistent progression but not uniform across rows). Maroon-Green compatibility for expansion unexplained (color similarity?).

#### 4. **Different-Color Blocks in the Same Row (Horizontal Color Propagation)**
   - **Description**: When blocks of **different colors** share a row, the rightmost block's color propagates leftward to unify the row. This occurs in train1 (y=8: Light Blues at x=0 & x=2 + Pink at x=6; y=11: Maroon left + Green right). No mixed-color row multiples in train2/3 (train2 y=8 has mixed but overridden by column priority, changing only left block via column). Consistent where present without column conflicts.
   - **Interconnected Properties**:
     - **Position (x-coordinate relative to others) → Color Change**: Rightmost block's color overwrites left blocks' colors; positions may stay or adjust slightly to fill gaps.
       - Train1: y=8 rightmost Pink (x=6) changes left Light Blues (x=0 & x=2) to Pink; adds new Pink at x=4 (fills gap); all remain pixels=1 (no merge).
       - Train1: y=11 rightmost Green (x=7) changes left Maroon (x=0-1) to Green (then expands as same-color horizontal).
     - **Position (x-coordinates) → Addition of New Blocks**: New blocks of the propagated color added to fill gaps in x.
       - Train1: y=8 adds Pink at x=4 (between x=2 & x=6).
   - **Unknowns**: Why y=8 results in discrete singles (every 2 units) vs. full merge like y=11 (propagation + expansion). Light Blue → Pink change unexplained (hue similarity?); no downward propagation observed.

#### General Consistent Notes Across All Interactions
- **Priority: Column over Row**: When a block participates in both row and column multiples, vertical (column) interaction takes priority for color/position changes (e.g., train2 y=8 mixed row ignored for color; left block changes via column instead). No counterexamples.
- **Color as Key Property**: All interactions preserve or propagate a single color within the group; no mixing of final colors in output structures. Holes=0 always (no interaction with holes).
- **Pixels/bbox as Outcome**: Interactions consistently affect size (via merge/expansion) or add new pixels=1 blocks; bbox adjusts to reflect this (e.g., wider x for horizontal, taller y for vertical).
- **Irrelevant/Non-Interacting Elements**: Isolated singles (no other same-row or same-column blocks) remain unchanged in position, color, size (e.g., many in train2 like Orange at x=18 y=3 stays; train3 Red at x=13 y=3 stays). These show no connections.
- **Unknown Transformations**: Exact grid bounds (e.g., why expand to x=8 or y=8 specifically) unknown; addition patterns (e.g., spacing like every 2/3/4 units) consistent but rule unclear; no observed interactions between non-sharing row/column blocks or across diagonals.
- **No Inconsistent Elements**: No properties like holes (always 0) or silhouettes affect anything; only color, position (x/y), and pixels/bbox show links. No semantic meanings (e.g., shapes beyond color/position) identifiable.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-03 05:20:35] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where numbers represent distinct elements or colors in a partially filled grid, and the goal is to propagate and fill the grid by identifying pairs of identical numbers in lines (rows or columns) and extending them as arithmetic chains with a fixed step distance, overwriting conflicts or filling zeros accordingly. The propagation decides direction based on grid dimensions (horizontal if more rows than columns, vertical otherwise), aiming to complete the grid logically without overfilling or ignoring patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Pairs of identical numbers (c) at positions p1 and p2 define a distance d = |p2 - p1|, which is used to extend the chain bidirectionally (left/decreasing and right/increasing indices) only if d > 0 and exactly two positions initially.
 * Extension fills zeros with c or checks if the next position already has c; if it has a conflicting number (different from c and non-zero), the entire current chain is overwritten with the conflicting color, but propagation stops there.
 * Chains are tracked with sets (chain_right/chain_left) to allow efficient overwriting, but note that left and right extensions are handled separately, potentially leading to partial overwrites if conflicts arise on one side.
 * The grid orientation decision (horizontal rows if num_rows > num_cols, else vertical columns) is a key heuristic, but it may fail if the puzzle requires processing both directions or if the grid is near-square; in the test case (9 rows x 21 cols), it defaults to vertical, which might miss horizontal patterns.
 * Only process if exactly two positions per color in the line initially; more or fewer are skipped, which could miss multi-pair or single-instance rules.
 * Deepcopy is used to avoid mutating input, and vertical processing rebuilds columns as lists then assigns back, which is efficient but error-prone if indices mismatch.
 * Subtle: Overwriting happens only on conflict detection, not proactively; also, if a position is already c during extension, it continues without adding to chain set (but code adds anyway if zero or c).
 * Potential miss: Chains don't merge across multiple pairs of the same c with different d; each pair is processed independently in sequence, which could lead to overwrites in later iterations.
 * No diagonal or multi-line propagation; strictly linear per row/column.
 * Empty or all-zero lines are handled gracefully (return empty grid if no rows).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict
import copy

def process_line(line: List[int], n: int):
    pos_by_c = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n):
        if line[i] != 0:
            pos_by_c[line[i]].append(i)
    for c in list(pos_by_c):
        poss = pos_by_c[c]
        if len(poss) != 2:
            continue
        p1, p2 = sorted(poss)
        d = p2 - p1
        if d == 0:
            continue
        # Extend right (increasing indices)
        chain_right = set([p1, p2])
        current = p2
        while True:
            nextp = current + d
            if nextp >= n:
                break
            if line[nextp] == 0 or line[nextp] == c:
                line[nextp] = c
                chain_right.add(nextp)
                current = nextp
            else:
                conflict_c = line[nextp]
                for pp in chain_right:
                    line[pp] = conflict_c
                break
        # Extend left (decreasing indices)
        chain_left = set([p1, p2])
        current = p1
        while True:
            nextp = current - d
            if nextp < 0:
                break
            if line[nextp] == 0 or line[nextp] == c:
                line[nextp] = c
                chain_left.add(nextp)
                current = nextp
            else:
                conflict_c = line[nextp]
                for pp in chain_left:
                    line[pp] = conflict_c
                break
```
(This process_line function is central and helpful for chain extension logic, correctly grouping by color and handling bidirectional propagation with conflict resolution.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g:
        return []
    num_rows = len(g)
    num_cols = len(g[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    grid = copy.deepcopy(g)
    if num_rows > num_cols:
        # Process horizontal (rows)
        for i in range(num_rows):
            process_line(grid[i], num_cols)
    else:
        # Process vertical (columns)
        for j in range(num_cols):
            col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(num_rows)]
            process_line(col, num_rows)
            for i in range(num_rows):
                grid[i][j] = col[i]
    return grid
```
(The main program function is helpful for orchestrating the process, including deepcopy and orientation decision, but the vertical processing loop could be refined for better index safety.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1, 2, and 3 all resulted in CORRECT outputs, indicating the core chain extension logic (pair detection, bidirectional filling, and conflict overwriting) works well for simpler or aligned cases.
 * The attempt successfully handles single-line propagation without infinite loops (via boundary checks) and skips invalid pairs (len != 2 or d=0).
 * However, the orientation heuristic (rows if taller than wide, else columns) worked for training but likely failed the test, as the test grid (9x21) processed vertically, potentially missing key horizontal patterns.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level puzzle elements (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted; the code treats the grid as independent lines, which is helpful for linear chains but misses any cross-line interactions.
 * process_line mutates the line in place, which is efficient but could lead to sequential overwrites within the same line (e.g., one pair's extension affecting another's positions), though this didn't break training.
 * No unhelpful functions were included; all code is relevant, but the lack of iterative re-processing (e.g., multiple passes over lines) might be a subtlety missed, as single-pass could leave unresolved propagations.
 * The attempt demonstrates understanding of arithmetic progression filling but doesn't handle cases where multiple pairs share the same d or c across the grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 9x21 grid with sparse filling (e.g., row 1 all zeros; row 2 has isolated 7,2,6; row 3 has 9 and two 5s at end; etc.), resulting in mostly zeros and no extensive chains, which does not look correct as it appears under-filled compared to expected propagation.
 * Specific issues: Positions like the 7 in row2 col9 and 2 in row2 col17 are not extended (e.g., no repeating pattern every d=8), suggesting vertical processing didn't trigger meaningful chains, or conflicts stopped early without visible overwrites.
 * Row 8 has 4 in col7, 7s in col18-20? Wait, output cuts off but shows partial 7,0,7—likely incomplete extension; row 3 ends with two adjacent 5s (d=1?), but no left/right fill into zeros.
 * Overall, the output lacks density; expected output should have more filled cells via chain extensions (e.g., the two 5s in row3 should fill leftward/rightward if d=1 allows), indicating the vertical-only approach missed horizontal pairs like the two 6s in row4 cols3 and 20 (d=17, potentially filling much of the row).
 * It's different from expected because training succeeded with likely smaller/squarer grids, but test's wide shape triggered suboptimal vertical processing; unknown if conflicts overwrote expected fills, but sparsity suggests minimal propagation occurred.

[2025-10-03 05:20:58] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements (colored blocks with properties like color, position/bbox, and size/pixels). These are limited to patterns that hold across **all** train examples without exceptions—meaning they occur when the relevant conditions are met in a given example, and do not contradict or fail in any example (even if the condition is absent in some examples, making the interaction vacuous there). Only direct, observable effects (e.g., one property affecting another, like position influencing extension) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., unchanged singles with no apparent effect on/from others) are excluded. Non-obvious or inconsistent transformations (e.g., color changes in columns like greens to yellow in train 2, or additions like the blue at x=6 y=1 in train 1) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained consistently across all examples. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant details (e.g., background, overall layout) are inferred.

#### 1. **Vertical Multi-Pixel Components (Same Color, Same x, Spanning Multiple y) → Position/Size Extension (Upwards Filling)**
   - **Description**: A vertical bar (pixels >1, bbox showing same x but range in y, same color) interacts with its own position by extending upwards. The min y is set to 0, max y remains the original, and all positions in between are filled with the same color, forming a single larger vertical component (increased pixels, updated bbox).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (original y-range) → new position (y from 0 to original max y) and size (pixels increase to fill the range).
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: No vertical multi-pixel components present, so no interaction occurs (consistent, no contradiction).
     - Train 2: Green vertical bar (x=9, y=7-8, pixels=2) extends to x=9, y=0-8, pixels=9.
     - Train 3: Red vertical bar (x=5, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends to x=5, y=0-6, pixels=7; Pink vertical bar (x=9, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends to x=9, y=0-6, pixels=7.
   - **Notes**: This is orientation-specific (vertical alignment triggers upwards extension). No color change involved. No holes or other shape properties affect this.

#### 2. **Horizontal Multi-Pixel Components (Same Color, Same y, Spanning Multiple x) → Position/Size Extension (Rightwards Filling)**
   - **Description**: A horizontal bar (pixels >1, bbox showing same y but range in x, same color) interacts with its own position by extending rightwards. The min x remains the original, max x is set to a fixed grid edge (observed as 8), and all positions in between are filled with the same color, forming a single larger horizontal component (increased pixels, updated bbox). (Note: In cases of conflict with other elements in the row, this may be overridden, but the extension attempt is consistent where no conflict.)
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (original x-range) → new position (x from original min to 8) and size (pixels increase to fill the range).
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Blue horizontal bar (y=4, x=0-1, pixels=2) extends to y=4, x=0-8, pixels=9. (The maroon horizontal bar at y=11, x=0-1, pixels=2 is overridden by another interaction but shows the extension pattern before override.)
     - Train 2: No horizontal multi-pixel components present, so no interaction occurs (consistent, no contradiction).
     - Train 3: No horizontal multi-pixel components present, so no interaction occurs (consistent, no contradiction).
   - **Notes**: This is orientation-specific (horizontal alignment triggers rightwards extension). No color change involved. No holes or other shape properties affect this. The fixed max x=8 is inferred from observed grid-like patterns (e.g., pixels=9 for full row).

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Interactions
- **Column-Based Color Changes (e.g., Same Column, Different y, Same or Different Colors) → Color or Addition**: Observed in train 2 (e.g., greens at x=2 y=5/8 change to yellow due to yellow at x=2 y=2; additions at y=0 in x=15/18) and train 3 (e.g., additions at y=0/2 in x=1, y=0 in x=13, matching existing red), but no similar effect in train 1 (e.g., blues at x=0 y=1/4 do not change or add vertically; light blue at x=0 y=8 changes to pink without clear column trigger). Cannot explain transformation consistently across all examples—called out as unknown.
- **Row-Based Additions or Color Propagation (e.g., Multiple Components in Same y) → Position/Color**: Observed in train 1 (e.g., light blues and pink at y=8 interact to add pink at x=4 and change light blues to pink; blues at y=1 add new blue at x=6), but no similar row additions or changes in train 2/3 (e.g., y=6 in train 3 has multiple reds/pink but no additions or changes within row). Not consistent across all examples—called out as unknown.
- **Overriding Between Row Elements (e.g., Single + Bar in Same y) → Color/Position**: Observed in train 1 (green single at y=11 x=7 overrides/changes the maroon bar at y=11 x=0-1, extending green left to x=0-7). No similar overriding in train 2/3 (no conflicting singles/bars in same row). Not consistent—called out as unknown.
- No consistent interactions involving holes (always 0, no effect observed), silhouettes/edges (all uniform pixelated blocks, no observable effect), or inter-color effects across rows/columns (e.g., no reliable color → color mapping like blue affecting green in all cases).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., position → movement without extension, or size → transformation) are identifiable without forcing non-existent connections. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated singles with no effect on/from others, like orange at x=18 y=3 in train 2 remaining unchanged) are excluded.

[2025-10-03 05:26:15] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or patterns) where the goal is to extend or complete linear chains of identical numbers in rows and columns based on detected pairs with consistent spacing (arithmetic progression), filling empty cells (0s) while handling conflicts by propagating a dominant or conflicting value, but only under specific conditions to avoid overfilling or incorrect propagation.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify pairs of identical non-zero numbers in the same row or column with a consistent distance d > 0; only process pairs (exactly 2 positions per color per line), ignoring singles or larger groups initially.
 * Extend chains bidirectionally (up/down for columns, left/right for rows) by multiples of d into empty (0) cells, filling them with the original color c unless a conflict occurs (non-zero, non-c cell encountered).
 * On conflict, stop extension at that point, propagate the conflicting color backward over the entire chain (including original positions), and do not fill beyond the conflict.
 * Process vertical (columns) transformations before horizontal (rows) to prioritize vertical patterns, but this order can cause cascading errors if horizontal passes overwrite or interact poorly.
 * Do not extend if d == 0 (same position) or if no empty cells fit the extension; chains must stay within grid bounds.
 * Subtlety: Extensions only fill 0s in non-conflict cases; existing same-color cells in the potential chain are kept but not used to trigger new pairs—re-process only based on initial pairs.
 * Easy to miss: Conflicts propagate the new color to the whole chain set (original + extended positions up to conflict), but only if a true conflict (different non-zero) is hit; same-color in path just extends normally.
 * Overfilling issue: Running vertical then horizontal can cause unintended fills (e.g., a vertical extension creates a new horizontal pair that overextends).
 * No diagonal or multi-line interactions; strictly row/column linear.
 * Grid may have irregular widths/heights, but assume rectangular; empty grid returns empty.
 * Potential for multiple pairs per line/color, but process each independently—could overlap and cause issues if not handled sequentially.
 * In examples, patterns like spaced 1's or 6's suggest periodic fills (e.g., every 3rd position), but only extend if pair detected; full lines (e.g., all 1's) may not trigger pair-based extension.
 * Conflicts seem to "assimilate" chains to the conflicting color, suggesting a dominance rule where stronger patterns overwrite weaker ones.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# The main program function is helpful as a base: it uses defaultdict to group positions by color, sorts pairs, computes d, generates potential extension lists (up/down or left/right), checks for conflicts sequentially, and applies fills or overwrites to chain_set.
# No separate classes or extraction functions are present, but the pos_by_c defaultdict(list) for grouping positions per color per line is key for identifying pairs.
# The chain_set = set([p, q]) initialization and incremental addition during extension (or up to conflict) is useful for tracking what to modify.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handles some periodic vertical/horizontal extensions without conflicts, as seen in Training example 2 passing fully.
 * Failed in Training example 1 by incorrectly filling extraneous 1's: generated [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in row 7 (expected all 0s) and [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] in row 10 (expected all 0s), likely due to over-extension from the row 1 pattern of 1's at cols 0,3,6 (d=3) propagating downward beyond intended bounds or interacting with horizontal passes; also minor mismatch in row 0/9 being all 0s but positions swapped in listing? (unclear, but outputs differ in filled 1's where no pattern justifies).
 * Succeeded in Training example 2 (full match, no specifics on grid but implies correct extension/conflict handling for that case).
 * Failed in Training example 3 by propagating wrong colors: generated row 2 as [0,6,0,...] (expected [0,2,0,...]), row 4 as [0,6,0,...] (expected [0,2,0,...]), and similar in other even/odd rows, suggesting vertical extension from 6's in col 1 overwrote or conflicted incorrectly with 2's pattern (alternating 2's every other row in cols 1,5,13); horizontal pass may not have corrected it, indicating order or conflict resolution bug.
 * The vertical-first-then-horizontal order worked for train 2 but caused overpropagation in train 1/3 (e.g., vertical fills create unintended horizontal pairs).
 * No separate object extraction function; the inline pos_by_c grouping is helpful but could be extracted for reuse to avoid re-scanning grid multiple times.
 * Conflict handling (propagating new_c to chain_set) is partially correct but over-applies in non-conflict paths (fills 0s only, but in examples it wrongly fills where no extension should occur).
 * The potential_up/down/left/right list generation via while loop is accurate for arithmetic sequences but misses if multiple chains overlap or if d varies.
 * No unhelpful functions present, but the entire program is brittle to order (vertical before horizontal) and doesn't re-scan for new pairs after fills, leading to incomplete propagation in complex grids.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows partial fills like row 1 with isolated 7,2,6; row 2 all 9's (possibly a full horizontal line not extended vertically); row 3 with 6,2,6 at ends; row 5 with spaced 6's and a 1; row 7 spaced 8's; row 8 alternating 7's with a 4 anomaly. This suggests over-extension vertically (e.g., 6's in col 0 rows 0-8? but row 0 all 0s) and horizontal (9's in row 2), but mismatches expected patterns—inferred rules from training suggest vertical 6's in col 20 should extend upward/downward by d from pairs (e.g., row3 col20=6, row5 col20=6 implies d=2, filling row1/7 col20 with 6 if empty, but generated row1 col20=6 correctly? wait, listing cuts off); however, the 4 in row8 col7 looks like an unhandled conflict or input remnant, and spaced 7's in row8 didn't extend left/right fully (e.g., d=2 from positions, but stops prematurely). It fails to propagate 9's vertically from row2 (expected to fill above/below if pairs form), and isolated 2 in row1 col17 suggests missed horizontal pair with row3 col19=2 (d= something, but not extended). Overall, looks like partial understanding: some chains filled (e.g., 8's in row7), but conflicts mishandled (4 not assimilated), and order causes incomplete test grid completion—does not match mentally simulated rules (e.g., full vertical 6 chain in col0/5/10/15/20 should fill all rows if d=1 pairs detected, but generated sparsely).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-completion puzzle where a partially filled 2D grid (with 0s as empty cells and positive integers as colors) must be filled by detecting and extending arithmetic progression patterns of the same color in rows (horizontal) or columns (vertical), using the GCD of position differences to determine the period and fill matching positions. The approach switches between row-wise and column-wise processing based on grid dimensions (taller grids prioritize horizontal, wider prioritize vertical), and handles both uniform-color patterns and mixed overrides.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on 1-indexed positions; only consider non-zero cells for computing differences and GCD, and fill only empty (0) cells or reinforce existing matches without overwriting mismatches.
 * For uniform colors in a row/column, compute GCD of sorted position differences, then fill every position congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, extending beyond observed positions if possible.
 * For mixed colors, first group by color and apply per-color filling (without overriding existing different colors), then optionally override sparse mixed patterns by filling with the color at the minimum position if the observed points exactly match the expected count for the span.
 * Grid orientation matters: if rows > columns, prioritize horizontal completion; else, do vertical per-color then mixed override— this prevents overfilling in non-dominant directions.
 * Subtlety: In mixed vertical cases, the override only applies if the number of observed points equals the expected in the arithmetic sequence span, to avoid hallucinating dense patterns; also, filling stops at grid bounds.
 * Easy to miss: GCD computation ignores empty lists (defaults to 1, but skips if <2 points); per-color vertical filling allows reinforcing but not overwriting conflicting colors; horizontal assumes all same color for full periodic fill, but vertical mixed uses min-color override only under strict conditions.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), considerations include deep-copying grids to avoid mutation, sorting positions, and handling edge cases like single points (skip) or full spans.
 * Potential overreach: The mixed override might incorrectly fill if GCD leads to exact match count but wrong color propagation; test grids may have overlapping row/column constraints that require sequential application without conflicts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD of differences; essential for period detection and used in all pattern extensions.)

```python
def horizontal_completion(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for i in range(num_rows):
        row = grid[i]
        pos_color = [(j + 1, row[j]) for j in range(num_cols) if row[j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        all_same = all(c == colors[0] for c in colors)
        if all_same:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            r = poss[0] % d
            c = colors[0]
            for jj in range(1, num_cols + 1):
                if jj % d == r:
                    row[jj - 1] = c
        else:
            diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
            d = compute_gcd(diffs)
            min_p = poss[0]
            max_p = poss[-1]
            color_max = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == max_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                row[current - 1][j] = color_max  # Note: Bug here, should be row[current - 1] = color_max? Wait, no, this is horizontal but code has row[jj-1], but in else it's incomplete.
    return grid
```
(This function works for uniform horizontal but has a bug in the mixed else branch: it sets row[current - 1][j] which assumes vertical indexing; it's unhelpful as-is for mixed horizontal and should be avoided or fixed. The uniform part is helpful.)

```python
def vertical_per_color_same(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):
        col_pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(col_pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        col_colors = set(c for _, c in col_pos_color)
        for cc in col_colors:
            group_pos = sorted(p for p, c in col_pos_color if c == cc)
            group_k = len(group_pos)
            if group_k < 2:
                continue
            group_diffs = [group_pos[m + 1] - group_pos[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
            group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
            group_r = group_pos[0] % group_d
            for ii in range(1, num_rows + 1):
                if ii % group_d == group_r:
                    if grid[ii - 1][j] == 0 or grid[ii - 1][j] == cc:
                        grid[ii - 1][j] = cc
    return grid
```
(This is helpful for per-color vertical filling without conflicts; key for mixed columns where colors are grouped separately.)

```python
def vertical_mixed_override(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    grid = copy.deepcopy(grid)
    num_rows = len(grid)
    num_cols = len(grid[0]) if num_rows > 0 else 0
    for j in range(num_cols):
        pos_color = [(i + 1, grid[i][j]) for i in range(num_rows) if grid[i][j] != 0]
        k = len(pos_color)
        if k < 2:
            continue
        poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
        colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
        colors_set = set(colors)
        if len(colors_set) <= 1:
            continue
        diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
        d = compute_gcd(diffs)
        min_p = poss[0]
        max_p = poss[-1]
        num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
        if num_exp == k:
            color_min = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
            current = min_p
            while current <= max_p:
                grid[current - 1][j] = color_min
    return grid
```
(This is conditionally helpful for overriding mixed verticals under exact-span conditions, but may overfill if not all points are intended; useful for sparse tests but risky.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary attempt shown; it correctly handles training examples 1-3 by applying orientation-based processing and GCD patterns.
 * Missed full horizontal mixed handling: the else branch in horizontal_completion has a indexing bug (uses [j] but j undefined, likely copy-paste error from vertical), leading to no-op or crash in mixed rows.
 * Vertical mixed override uses min-color fill, but in some cases (e.g., test) it might need max or average; unknown why it underfills test.
 * Per-color vertical is essential for avoiding color conflicts in mixed columns, and it worked for training.
 * No extraction functions for "objects" (e.g., connected components); this puzzle is purely positional arithmetic, not blob-based, so object extraction would be unhelpful or broken.
 * Training successes suggest core GCD and uniform filling works, but test failure indicates subtlety in mixed or orientation for irregular grids.
 * The program function's orientation switch (rows > cols for horizontal) is key but may fail if test grid is square-ish or has cross-patterns needing both directions iteratively.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9-row by 21-column grid (inferred from row lengths) that remains extremely sparse, with only scattered numbers like 7s, 2s, 5s, 6s, 1s, 8s, 4s in positions matching the input (e.g., row 2 has 7 at col 10, 2 at col 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at col 7, 5s at 20-21), and vast zeros elsewhere—no evident filling occurred beyond input.
 * This does not look correct: Expected output should show periodic extensions, e.g., the two 2s in row 2 (positions ~18 and 21, diff 3) might GCD to 3 and fill every 3rd position with 2 horizontally, but nothing is added; similarly, vertical 5s in col 20 (rows 3-4) should extend downward if uniform, but no change.
 * Underfilling suggests the program skipped most cases: likely because test grid has few lines with >=2 same-color points (many singles or mixed without exact span), and the horizontal mixed bug prevented any row fills; vertical per-color/mixed only touched columns with multiples but didn't propagate due to short spans or conflicts.
 * Differences from expected: No arithmetic fills visible (e.g., col 21 has 2,5,2,?,6,? which mixes colors without GCD match, so skipped correctly? But test likely needs more aggressive extension); output matches input almost exactly, implying no meaningful completion—probably wrong as puzzles expect denser grids.
 * To handle test, need bug fix in horizontal mixed, perhaps iterative row-col passes, or looser override conditions (e.g., fill if num_exp >= k).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (representing colors or values) where the goal is to complete partially filled rows and columns by extending patterns, primarily arithmetic progressions of non-zero values into zero positions, with different handling for horizontal (rows) and vertical (columns) directions based on grid dimensions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify non-zero positions (S) in a line (row or column); if fewer than 2, no filling occurs.
 * For perfect arithmetic progressions (all differences equal), extend forward and backward from the starting position using the common difference d, overwriting zeros but not existing values (in vertical case, it checks if out[pos] == 0).
 * If not a perfect AP in horizontal (non-vertical), compute GCD of all differences and fill every GCD steps from start to end using the last non-zero value c.
 * In vertical (columns), handle per color separately: for each color's positions, check if they form a perfect AP and extend only into zeros if it's a perfect AP for that color.
 * Grid orientation matters: if more rows than columns, process rows horizontally; else, process columns vertically and reconstruct the grid.
 * Subtlety: Vertical processing groups by color and only extends perfect APs per color, avoiding overwriting; horizontal non-AP uses GCD filling with last value, which may not align with per-color logic.
 * Easy to miss: No filling if single non-zero or no pattern; GCD filling is only for horizontal non-AP and uses last value, not first or average; vertical doesn't use GCD, sticking to per-color perfect APs.
 * Considerations: Potential overwriting issues (code avoids in vertical but not explicitly in horizontal AP); assumes grid is rectangular; numbers are colors, so same number = same pattern group.

(Note: These are the core functions from the attempt; they handle line processing and grid orientation. No additional types like classes were used, but List[List[int]] for grid is implicit.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled training examples 1, 2, and 3, demonstrating understanding of AP extension in both directions and GCD-based filling for horizontal non-AP cases.
 * Worked well for perfect APs by extending with constant value from start position.
 * Vertical per-color AP detection and zero-only filling avoided conflicts effectively in training cases.
 * Did not work fully for the test input: generated output shows heavy filling of 5's in what appears to be column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 have 5 in position 19, and some extras like row 2 has two 5's, row 3 has 5 and 2), but leaves most of the grid as zeros, suggesting incomplete pattern detection (e.g., no horizontal fillings observed, and vertical fillings seem biased toward 5's without addressing other colors like 7,2,6, etc., properly).
 * GCD filling in horizontal non-AP is limited to range S[0] to S[-1] and uses last value, which may miss extensions beyond the observed non-zeros or use wrong color in multi-color lines.
 * Vertical processing only extends perfect APs per color but ignores non-AP colors entirely, potentially missing GCD-like logic for vertical non-AP (asymmetry with horizontal).
 * No extraction functions for objects like "blobs" or connected components were used or needed; the line-based approach fits the pattern-extension puzzle but may overlook diagonal or multi-line interactions.
 * Function process_line is helpful and core to the solution, correctly copying existing non-zeros to output.
 * Overall, demonstrates core AP and GCD understanding but incomplete for test due to unhandled cases like mixed colors in vertical or non-extending beyond bounds.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output appears to be a 9x21 grid (incomplete last row), with most positions still 0, but noticeable vertical fillings of 5's in column 19 across rows 0-8 (e.g., [...,5] in row 0, [...,5,2] in row 1, [...,5,5] in row 2, etc.), and some extras like 2 in row 1 col 20, 5 in row 3 col 20? Wait, formatting suggests column 19 is mostly 5's, column 20 has mixed 0,2,5,2,0,6,0,8,7.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely fill more patterns, such as horizontal APs (e.g., the 5's in column 19 suggest a vertical AP of 5's every 1 row, but code's vertical processing should catch that if perfect AP; however, other elements like the 7 in row 1 col 9, 9 in row 2 col 6, 6 in row 3 col 3, etc., seem unextended, leaving isolated non-zeros without filling nearby zeros).
 * Missing horizontal extensions entirely (e.g., row 6 has 1 at col 13 and 6 at col 15, diff=2, but no filling shown; if AP, should extend).
 * Bias toward filling 5's suggests the per-color vertical logic caught a strong AP for 5 (positions in col 19? Wait, no—the input isn't shown, but output implies input had 5's in col 19 at intervals, extended fully), but ignored or failed on other colors like 2 (appears in row 1 col 17 and 20, row 3 col 20, row 7 col 17, row 8 col 18? Not extended consistently).
 * Looks incomplete because ~90% zeros remain, whereas expected should propagate patterns more aggressively (e.g., if vertical since 9 rows < 21 cols? Code would process columns vertically, but output shows uneven filling, possibly missing GCD for non-AP columns).
 * Subtle difference: In row 8, ends with 5,7—may have partially filled a pattern, but unclear if correct without input; overall, does not match a "completed" puzzle grid, as patterns like the diagonal-ish 2's or scattered numbers aren't resolved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid-filling puzzle where the goal is to extend or complete patterns in rows and columns of a numerical grid (likely representing colors or values) based on detected arithmetic progressions, common differences, or GCD-based spacing, prioritizing horizontal fills in wider grids and vertical in taller ones, while handling multiple "colors" separately in vertical processing to avoid overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are only extended if there are at least two non-zero values in a line to establish a difference (arithmetic progression check fails for single points or no points).
 * For horizontal (non-vertical) processing, if not a perfect AP, fall back to GCD of differences to fill from start to end with the last value's color, but only within the span of existing points—do not extrapolate beyond.
 * Vertical processing handles per-color APs separately, filling empty spots without overwriting existing values, and extends both forward and backward, but only if a perfect AP is detected per color.
 * Grid orientation matters: process rows if more rows than columns (tall grid), columns if more columns than rows (wide grid)—this avoids redundant processing.
 * Subtlety: Extensions in vertical mode check for empty (0) spots only when filling to avoid conflicts, but horizontal GCD mode unconditionally fills within span, potentially overwriting (though input likely has no conflicts).
 * Easy to miss: GCD fallback is horizontal-only and uses the last value's color, not the first; vertical per-color filling can create overlapping patterns but respects existing values.
 * No diagonal or multi-line interactions; purely per-row or per-column.
 * Zeros are placeholders to fill; non-zeros are fixed clues.
 * Potential edge cases: All zeros (no fill), single non-zero (no extension), irregular spacing (GCD approximates), multiple colors in one line (vertical splits them).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict
from math import gcd

def process_line(line: List[int], n: int, is_vertical: bool) -> List[int]:
    # Extracts non-zero positions S, checks for perfect AP with common diff d.
    # If AP: extends forward/backward from first position using d and first value c.
    # Non-AP horizontal: computes GCD of diffs, fills from first to last pos with last value c using GCD step.
    # Vertical non-AP: groups by color, checks AP per color, extends per color without overwriting.
    # Returns filled line with zeros replaced where patterns match.
    out = [0] * n
    # ... (full implementation as in the provided program)
    return out
```

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Determines orientation: rows if tall, columns if wide.
    # Applies process_line to each row or extracted column.
    # Reconstructs output grid.
    # Handles empty grid edge case.
    # ... (full implementation as in the provided program)
    return out_g  # or processed rows
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly extending APs and GCD patterns without overfills or misses.
 * The attempt demonstrates understanding of orientation-based processing (rows vs. columns) and per-color handling in vertical mode, which likely passed trainings by filling sparse patterns accurately.
 * However, the GCD fallback in horizontal mode is limited to the span of existing points (S[0] to S[-1]), which might miss full-line extensions if the puzzle expects extrapolation beyond clues.
 * Vertical mode's per-color AP is helpful but only activates if perfect AP per color; irregular multi-color lines may leave zeros unfilled.
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components or blobs) is present, but it's not needed—line-based processing suffices; adding blob detection would be unhelpful and overcomplicate.
 * The `process_line` function is core and helpful, correctly isolating non-zeros and diffs; retain and refine it.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; the gcd import and Dict for pos_by_color are relevant.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills the grid but leaves many zeros, with extensions like repeated 5's in column 19 (e.g., rows 0-8 all get 5? Wait, shown lines suggest vertical fills for 5's in col 19/20, but inconsistent: line 0 has 5 at pos19, line1 has 5 at20 and2 at20? Output shows incomplete patterns.
 * It does not look fully correct: For example, in row 1 (second line), there's a 7 at pos9, 2 at17, 5 at19,2 at20— if horizontal processing, GCD of diffs might not fill between them properly, leaving zeros; vertical for col9 should extend the 7 if AP, but output shows only isolated 7s without clear extension (e.g., row2 col6 has9, not related).
 * Observed effects: Heavy filling of 5's in later columns (e.g., col19/20 across rows), likely from vertical AP detection for color5, but misses horizontal patterns like potential AP in row5 (1 at13,6 at15—diff2, could extend but doesn't). Also, row7 has2 at17,8 at20, but no fill between. Differs from expected by under-filling horizontals (e.g., row3:6 at3, then zeros until5 at19—GCD fallback should fill some but span-limited). Row8:4 at7,7 at18,5 at19,7 at20—multi-color, vertical might split but output shows no extensions. Unknown why some isolates like row2's9 at6 aren't extended, possibly no AP partner.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (some vertical 5-chains look extended correctly) but is incomplete, missing horizontal GCD fills and potential bi-directional extensions beyond spans, suggesting the program under-extends in non-perfect AP cases.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where the goal is to fill in zero-valued cells (empty spaces) by propagating colors from existing non-zero patterns, either horizontally or vertically depending on the grid's aspect ratio (taller grids horizontal, wider vertical). The propagation follows arithmetic sequences based on distances between paired identical colors, extending through zeros while adapting to encountered colors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Identify pairs of identical non-zero colors in a line (row or column); if more or fewer than two occurrences, skip that color.
 * Compute the distance d between the pair's positions, then extend the pattern bidirectionally: fill zeros with the current color, continue with same color if matched, or switch to a new color if a different non-zero is hit and include that position.
 * Choose direction based on grid shape: horizontal propagation for h > w (row-wise), vertical for h <= w (column-wise); this ensures the longer dimension is processed first.
 * Extension stops at grid boundaries or when no further progress is possible (e.g., non-extendable non-zero without matching pattern).
 * Subtlety: Propagation can chain colors (e.g., hitting a different color changes the propagating color for further extension), but only for exactly two initial positions per color; multiple pairs or singles are ignored.
 * Zeros are placeholders to fill but not initiators; non-zeros must form the seed pairs.
 * Potential miss: Over-extension if d=0 (same position, but code assumes distinct); or failure to handle sparse grids where pairs are far apart.
 * In vertical mode, transpose logic by processing columns as lists.
 * All changes are in-place on a copied grid to avoid side effects.
 * Edge case: Empty grid or single row/column returns unchanged; colors >9 or negatives unhandled (assume 1-9 positives).

    # Checks h > w for horizontal else vertical; handles empty
    pass  # (as in code; decides orientation based on dimensions)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt provided; it successfully handled all three training examples by correctly identifying pairs and propagating through zeros with color adaptation.
 * Worked well for dense patterns in training where pairs had clear distances and extensions filled expected zeros without overreaching.
 * Did not work for the test input: propagation seems incomplete, as the output remains mostly zeros with only isolated numbers (e.g., 7,2,6 in row 1; 9,5,5 in row 2), suggesting failures to detect pairs, compute proper d, or extend chains across the sparse 21x9 grid.
 * Code assumes exactly two positions per color to start; test may have colors with 1 or >2 instances, causing skips and under-filling.
 * Extension logic breaks early on non-matching non-zeros without including them fully, leading to partial fills (e.g., row 8 has 8s but no extension visible).
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., connected components or blobs) was attempted, but it's not needed here—propagation is linear, not blob-based; future attempts should avoid blob extraction as irrelevant.
 * The orientation choice (h > w) worked for training but may mismatch test if grid is square-ish (21 rows? output shows 9 lines, perhaps test is wider).
 * Function `transform_line` is helpful and core but buggy in test: likely misses multi-pair colors or zero-d distances.
 * No unhelpful functions noted beyond potential overcomplication with defaultdict (but it's fine).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows a 9-row grid (possibly truncated from 21?) with vast majority zeros and only scattered single or paired numbers (e.g., row 1: 7 at col9, 2 at col17, 6 at col20; row 2: 9 at col6, 5s at col19-20), indicating minimal propagation occurred.
 * Expected more filling: test input (inferred from output patterns) likely has seed numbers like 6s, 2s, 7s, 5s, 9s, 1s, 8s, 4s that should pair and extend across rows/columns, filling long zero stretches (e.g., row 0 all zeros suggests no vertical propagation hit it).
 * Differences from expected: Output ignores potential vertical pairs (e.g., 6 in row3 col3 and row5 col15? no fill between); horizontal extensions stalled (e.g., two 5s in row2 col19-20 should extend left/right with d=1, but nothing added). This is different because training succeeded on similar propagations—test sparsity or >2 instances per color likely broke pair detection.
 * No chaining observed (e.g., 7 in row1 col9 and row8 col17? no vertical fill), so output under-fills dramatically compared to a correct solution that should densely populate based on arithmetic extensions.
 * Looks incorrect overall: too sparse, no evidence of bidirectional extension or color switches, failing to transform the grid meaningfully.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where numbers represent distinct elements or colors in a partially filled grid, and the goal is to propagate and fill the grid by identifying pairs of identical numbers in lines (rows or columns) and extending them as arithmetic chains with a fixed step distance, overwriting conflicts or filling zeros accordingly. The propagation decides direction based on grid dimensions (horizontal if more rows than columns, vertical otherwise), aiming to complete the grid logically without overfilling or ignoring patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Pairs of identical numbers (c) at positions p1 and p2 define a distance d = |p2 - p1|, which is used to extend the chain bidirectionally (left/decreasing and right/increasing indices) only if d > 0 and exactly two positions initially.
 * Extension fills zeros with c or checks if the next position already has c; if it has a conflicting number (different from c and non-zero), the entire current chain is overwritten with the conflicting color, but propagation stops there.
 * Chains are tracked with sets (chain_right/chain_left) to allow efficient overwriting, but note that left and right extensions are handled separately, potentially leading to partial overwrites if conflicts arise on one side.
 * The grid orientation decision (horizontal rows if num_rows > num_cols, else vertical columns) is a key heuristic, but it may fail if the puzzle requires processing both directions or if the grid is near-square; in the test case (9 rows x 21 cols), it defaults to vertical, which might miss horizontal patterns.
 * Only process if exactly two positions per color in the line initially; more or fewer are skipped, which could miss multi-pair or single-instance rules.
 * Deepcopy is used to avoid mutating input, and vertical processing rebuilds columns as lists then assigns back, which is efficient but error-prone if indices mismatch.
 * Subtle: Overwriting happens only on conflict detection, not proactively; also, if a position is already c during extension, it continues without adding to chain set (but code adds anyway if zero or c).
 * Potential miss: Chains don't merge across multiple pairs of the same c with different d; each pair is processed independently in sequence, which could lead to overwrites in later iterations.
 * No diagonal or multi-line propagation; strictly linear per row/column.
 * Empty or all-zero lines are handled gracefully (return empty grid if no rows).

            process_line(grid[i], num_cols)
    else:
        # Process vertical (columns)
        for j in range(num_cols):
            col = [grid[i][j] for i in range(num_rows)]
            process_line(col, num_rows)
            for i in range(num_rows):
                grid[i][j] = col[i]
    return grid
```
(The main program function is helpful for orchestrating the process, including deepcopy and orientation decision, but the vertical processing loop could be refined for better index safety.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training examples 1, 2, and 3 all resulted in CORRECT outputs, indicating the core chain extension logic (pair detection, bidirectional filling, and conflict overwriting) works well for simpler or aligned cases.
 * The attempt successfully handles single-line propagation without infinite loops (via boundary checks) and skips invalid pairs (len != 2 or d=0).
 * However, the orientation heuristic (rows if taller than wide, else columns) worked for training but likely failed the test, as the test grid (9x21) processed vertically, potentially missing key horizontal patterns.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level puzzle elements (e.g., blobs or regions) was attempted; the code treats the grid as independent lines, which is helpful for linear chains but misses any cross-line interactions.
 * process_line mutates the line in place, which is efficient but could lead to sequential overwrites within the same line (e.g., one pair's extension affecting another's positions), though this didn't break training.
 * No unhelpful functions were included; all code is relevant, but the lack of iterative re-processing (e.g., multiple passes over lines) might be a subtlety missed, as single-pass could leave unresolved propagations.
 * The attempt demonstrates understanding of arithmetic progression filling but doesn't handle cases where multiple pairs share the same d or c across the grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 9x21 grid with sparse filling (e.g., row 1 all zeros; row 2 has isolated 7,2,6; row 3 has 9 and two 5s at end; etc.), resulting in mostly zeros and no extensive chains, which does not look correct as it appears under-filled compared to expected propagation.
 * Specific issues: Positions like the 7 in row2 col9 and 2 in row2 col17 are not extended (e.g., no repeating pattern every d=8), suggesting vertical processing didn't trigger meaningful chains, or conflicts stopped early without visible overwrites.
 * Row 8 has 4 in col7, 7s in col18-20? Wait, output cuts off but shows partial 7,0,7—likely incomplete extension; row 3 ends with two adjacent 5s (d=1?), but no left/right fill into zeros.
 * Overall, the output lacks density; expected output should have more filled cells via chain extensions (e.g., the two 5s in row3 should fill leftward/rightward if d=1 allows), indicating the vertical-only approach missed horizontal pairs like the two 6s in row4 cols3 and 20 (d=17, potentially filling much of the row).
 * It's different from expected because training succeeded with likely smaller/squarer grids, but test's wide shape triggered suboptimal vertical processing; unknown if conflicts overwrote expected fills, but sparsity suggests minimal propagation occurred.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a sparse grid of numbered cells (representing colors) where the task is to fill in the blank cells (0s) by extending arithmetic progression patterns either horizontally across rows or vertically down columns, determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of position differences for placed colors. The direction of processing (horizontal if more rows than columns, vertical otherwise) suggests the puzzle adapts to grid aspect ratio, with rules prioritizing uniform color extensions, per-color independent fillings, and overrides for mixed-color cases to avoid conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are based on positions (1-indexed) of non-zero cells; compute differences between consecutive positions of the same color (or all positions if uniform), then use GCD as the step size (d) to extend fillings starting from the first position's residue (r = pos[0] % d).
 * For uniform colors in a line (row or column), fill every d steps across the entire length if the pattern is consistent; for mixed colors, limit filling to the span between min and max positions to avoid over-extension.
 * Per-color processing is crucial for vertical cases: treat each color independently to extend its own AP without interfering with others initially, only overriding zeros or matching cells.
 * Mixed-color overrides should check if the number of expected positions in the AP equals the number of actual placements (indicating a sparse uniform fill disguised as mixed), then fill the span with the starting color; this handles cases where multiple colors appear but follow a single underlying pattern.
 * Direction decision (horizontal if num_rows > num_cols, else vertical) is key, but vertical processing requires two passes: per-color extension first (to build independent patterns), then mixed override (to unify sparse cases).
 * Subtle edge cases: single or zero placements do nothing; GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1 (but skipped); avoid overwriting existing non-matching cells in per-color extensions; positions must be sorted for diff calculation.
 * Grid is list of lists, output must be deep copy to avoid mutating input; assume rectangular grid with consistent lengths.
 * Potential for conflicts in vertical mixed cases: if after per-color, a column has interleaved colors, the mixed override may not trigger correctly if num_exp != k due to partial fills.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is a solid utility for GCD computation on position differences; reliable and handles empty lists gracefully.)

```python
def per_color_extension(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_by_color = {}
    for i in range(length):
        c = line[i]
        if c != 0:
            if c not in pos_by_color:
                pos_by_color[c] = []
            pos_by_color[c].append(i + 1)
    for cc, group_poss in pos_by_color.items():
        group_k = len(group_poss)
        if group_k < 2:
            continue
        group_poss = sorted(group_poss)
        group_diffs = [group_poss[m + 1] - group_poss[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
        group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
        group_r = group_poss[0] % group_d
        for p in range(1, length + 1):
            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == cc:
                    out[p - 1] = cc
    return out
```
(This function is helpful for independent color extensions in vertical processing; it groups positions by color, computes per-color GCD/AP, and fills safely without overwriting mismatches—essential for handling multi-color columns.)

```python
def mixed_override_line(line: List[int], length: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_color = [(i + 1, line[i]) for i in range(length) if line[i] != 0]
    k = len(pos_color)
    if k < 2:
        return out
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    colors = [c for _, c in pos_color]
    colors_set = set(colors)
    if len(colors_set) <= 1:
        return out
    diffs = [poss[m + 1] - poss[m] for m in range(k - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    min_p = poss[0]
    max_p = poss[-1]
    num_exp = (max_p - min_p) // d + 1
    if num_exp == k:
        c = next(c for p, c in pos_color if p == min_p)
        current = min_p
        while current <= max_p:
            out[current - 1] = c
            current += d
    return out
```
(This is useful for detecting and unifying sparse uniform patterns in mixed-color lines; it checks if placements exactly match an AP count, then overrides the span with the starting color—key for subtle uniform fills.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled all three training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of GCD-based AP extensions and direction-based processing (horizontal for tall grids, vertical with per-color then mixed for wide grids).
 * The process_horizontal function worked well for uniform or endpoint-driven fills in rows, but may not be triggered in test (likely wide grid, so vertical path used).
 * Per_color_extension successfully built independent patterns in training vertical cases without conflicts.
 * Mixed_override_line correctly unified sparse cases in training, but in test, it may not have triggered enough due to post-per-color state not matching num_exp == k condition precisely.
 * No extraction of "objects" or higher-level structures attempted; the code focuses on line-by-line processing, which aligns with puzzle but misses potential grid-wide pattern interactions (e.g., if patterns align across lines).
 * No unhelpful functions introduced; all provided (compute_gcd, process_horizontal, per_color_extension, mixed_override_line) are relevant, though process_horizontal's "else" branch (filling with max color) might over-simplify mixed horizontal cases compared to vertical's per-color approach.
 * Overall, core AP/GCD logic is strong, but vertical mixed override may need refinement for partial fills or interleaved colors after per-color step.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows minimal filling: e.g., row 2 has 7 at column 10, 2s at 18 and 21; row 3 has 9 at 7, 5s at 20-21; row 4 has 6 at 4, 5 at 20, 2 at 21; row 6 has 1 at 14, 6s at 16 and 21; row 8 has 2 at 18, 8 at 21; row 9 has 4 at 8, 7s at 19 and 21—mostly preserving input placements with little extension (many rows/columns remain all zeros).
 * This does not look correct; expected output should have more extensive fillings based on AP extensions (e.g., if test grid has vertical patterns like color 2 in column 21 across rows 2,4,?, it should fill gaps with step d from GCD), but output lacks such completions, suggesting per_color_extension or mixed_override didn't propagate far enough (possibly due to insufficient placements per color to trigger GCD>1, or override not activating on post-per-color state).
 * Zeros dominate (e.g., entire row 1 and 5,7), indicating no horizontal processing (consistent with wide grid assumption) and incomplete vertical extensions; for instance, column 21 has multiple 2/5/6/8/7 but no apparent filling between them, differing from expected unified AP if they share a residue.
 * The output makes partial sense for preserving input but fails to demonstrate full pattern extension, likely missing subtle rule for extending beyond min-max in per-color if AP is global, or handling colors with only one placement (which skips but might need propagation from adjacent lines—though puzzle seems line-independent).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a partially filled grid where numbers represent colors, and the goal is to extend patterns in rows or columns based on arithmetic progressions derived from the positions of existing colors, using GCD to determine periodicity and fill zeros accordingly, while handling uniform vs. mixed color cases.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are extended either horizontally (per row) or vertically (per column), decided by comparing num_rows > num_cols; this orientation choice is crucial and may need flexibility if the grid is square.
 * For uniform colors in a line, compute GCD of position differences, then fill all positions congruent to the starting residue modulo GCD with that color, potentially across the entire line.
 * For mixed colors, handle per-color extensions (extending each color's own progression independently, overwriting zeros or matching values) before attempting overrides; overrides only apply if the number of expected positions matches the given ones exactly, using the starting color to fill the progression.
 * Subtlety: Positions are 1-indexed in calculations (e.g., i+1), and extensions stop at the line length; avoid overwriting existing non-matching colors in per-color extensions.
 * Key: If fewer than 2 positions per color/group, no extension; empty lines or singletons remain unchanged.
 * Consideration: GCD of empty diffs defaults to 1, but lines with no colors stay all zeros; mixed overrides only trigger for exact progression matches to avoid overfilling.
 * Easy to miss: In mixed horizontal extensions, it uses the last sorted color (potentially incorrect—should it be the first or majority?); column processing chains per-color then override, which may conflict in dense grids.
 * Overall: Prioritize uniform extensions; for mixed, per-color is safer than full overrides to prevent bleeding colors incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def compute_gcd(diffs: List[int]) -> int:
    if not diffs:
        return 1
    return reduce(gcd, diffs)
```
(This is useful for finding common differences in positions.)

```python
def is_uniform(pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    if not pos_color:
        return True
    c0 = pos_color[0][1]
    return all(c == c0 for _, c in pos_color)
```
(This checks if all given colors in positions are the same, key for deciding uniform vs. mixed handling.)

```python
def extend_uniform(line: List[int], pos_color: List[tuple[int, int]]) -> List[int]:
    poss = sorted(p for p, _ in pos_color)
    diffs = [poss[i + 1] - poss[i] for i in range(len(poss) - 1)]
    d = compute_gcd(diffs)
    r = poss[0] % d
    c = pos_color[0][1]
    n = len(line)
    out = line[:]
    for p in range(1, n + 1):
        if p % d == r:
            out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This correctly extends a uniform color across the full line using modulo residue, a core mechanic.)

```python
def per_color_extension(line: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:
    out = line[:]
    pos_by_color: dict[int, List[int]] = {}
    for i in range(n):
        c = line[i]
        if c != 0:
            if c not in pos_by_color:
                pos_by_color[c] = []
            pos_by_color[c].append(i + 1)
    for c, group_poss in pos_by_color.items():
        group_k = len(group_poss)
        if group_k < 2:
            continue
        group_poss = sorted(group_poss)
        group_diffs = [group_poss[m + 1] - group_poss[m] for m in range(group_k - 1)]
        group_d = compute_gcd(group_diffs)
        group_r = group_poss[0] % group_d
        for p in range(1, n + 1):
            if p % group_d == group_r:
                if out[p - 1] == 0 or out[p - 1] == c:
                    out[p - 1] = c
    return out
```
(This is essential for handling mixed colors by extending each independently without aggressive overwriting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) successfully passed all three training examples, indicating strong handling of uniform and basic mixed extensions in rows/columns.
 * Worked: GCD-based periodicity correctly extends uniforms across full lines; per-color extension avoids conflicts in mixed cases; orientation logic (rows if taller) works for training grids.
 * Did not work: In the test, many rows/columns remain mostly zeros (e.g., row 0 all zeros, row 4 all zeros), suggesting no extension triggered despite potential patterns—possibly due to <2 positions per group or mixed override failing when num_exp != k.
 * Problem understanding: The puzzle involves filling a sparse grid by extrapolating color progressions, but this attempt assumes full-line extensions for uniforms and cautious per-color for mixed; it may miss cases where mixed overrides should propagate a dominant color or where vertical processing needs row-wise checks first.
 * extract_objects not present or needed—no object extraction here; puzzle is line-based, not blob/object-oriented.
 * Function `extend_mixed_horizontal` is somewhat broken/not fully helpful: It always uses the last sorted color for filling, which ignores mixed nature and may overwrite incorrectly; only fills between min/max, not full line—use sparingly or fix to select starting color properly.
 * Function `mixed_override` is conditionally helpful but restrictive: Only fills if exact match on expected positions, leaving many zeros in test (e.g., row 1 has 7 at 10, 2s at 18/20—GCD=2? but no full extension); good for avoiding overfill but may underfill test cases with partial progressions.
 * process_row/process_column chain per-color then override, which worked for training but likely under-extends test columns (e.g., column 19 has 5,5,2 in rows 2-4, but no visible vertical fill).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct; it shows partial fills (e.g., row 1: isolated 7 at pos 10, 2s at 18/20 but no further extension like every 8? positions if GCD=8), leaving most of the 21x9? grid as zeros, which suggests under-extension compared to expected full pattern completion.
 * Row 0 all zeros: Expected some fill if input had implicit patterns or if orientation was wrong—output unchanged, indicating no positions triggered extension.
 * Row 2: 9 at pos7, 5s at 20/21—GCD=13? but no extension between/around; looks incorrect as it should fill progression if uniform/mixed per color.
 * Row 3: 6 at4, 5 at20, 2 at21—mixed, per-color should extend 6's singleton (none) and 5/2 (none since adjacent), but zeros dominate; different from expected by not filling any arithmetic sequence.
 * Vertical: e.g., column 20 has 2 (row1),5(row2),2(row3),6(row5)—mixed, but output shows no vertical fills, likely because num_rows=9 > num_cols=21? Wait, 9<21 so processes columns, but result has sparse fills only where input had them—underfilled, missing expected GCD extensions like for 2s or 5s.
 * Overall, test output is too sparse (mostly zeros, only input positions filled, no visible extensions beyond originals); expected denser grid with propagated colors (e.g., row 7: 2 at18,8 at21—no fill; row 8:4 at8,7 at19/21—should extend 7 every 2? but doesn't). This differs by lacking progression fills, possibly due to strict <2 or exact-match conditions blocking valid partial patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers (colors) where the goal is to fill in empty cells (0s) based on detected arithmetic patterns in rows (horizontal mode) or columns (vertical mode), using GCD to identify common differences among positions of matching colors, and then propagating the color forward or based on majority/last occurrence rules. The mode switches based on whether rows outnumber columns, and filling prioritizes same-color groups or extends to the maximum position with the dominant color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Determine processing mode by comparing num_rows > num_cols (horizontal, process rows left-to-right) vs. otherwise (vertical, process columns bottom-to-top, with positions inverted as p = num_rows - 1 - ii).
 * For a starting color c at position 0 (or bottom in vertical), find all positions with c, compute GCD d of those positions (skip if d==0 or <=1 positions).
 * Candidates are positions k where k % d == r (r = first_pos % d), but only up to grid bounds.
 * If all candidate colors match c, fill all candidates with c; else, find max_pos among colored candidates, use its color as fill_color, and fill only up to <= max_pos.
 * Skip rows/columns if starting cell is 0 or no valid group_colors.
 * Vertical mode inverts row indices for position calculations (p increases upward from bottom), ensuring bottom-up processing.
 * GCD handles irregular spacing but assumes positions are integers starting from 0.
 * Output is a copy of input with only fills applied; unchanged 0s remain.
 * Subtle: In non-same color case, filling stops at max_pos to avoid overextending mismatched patterns; in vertical, candidates_p range to max_p = num_rows-1.
 * Easy to miss: Positions list must be built from actual g[i][j] == c, not output; d computed only on those positions, not all candidates.
 * Grids may be rectangular (rows != cols), and empty/sparse grids return empty.
 * No diagonal or multi-direction processing; strictly row or column based on mode.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from math import gcd
from typing import List

# Core program function as provided; it's the main tool for processing.
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (full code as in attempt; handles mode detection, GCD computation, candidate filling)
    pass

# Implicit helper: Position finder for a color in row/col.
# Example extraction (not in code but useful for debugging):
def find_positions_in_row(g: List[List[int]], row_idx: int, color: int, num_cols: int) -> List[int]:
    return [j for j in range(num_cols) if g[row_idx][j] == color]

# Similar for column (adapt for vertical):
def find_positions_in_col(g: List[List[int]], col_idx: int, color: int, num_rows: int) -> List[int]:
    return [num_rows - 1 - i for i in range(num_rows) if g[i][col_idx] == color]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt provided; it successfully handles training examples 1-3 completely (all marked CORRECT), demonstrating solid understanding of mode switching, GCD-based pattern detection, and conditional filling rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies and fills arithmetic progression patterns with same-color propagation or max_pos-limited extension; vertical mode inversion works for bottom-up processing; skips invalid cases (d=0, no positions, empty groups).
 * What didn't work: For the test input, the generated output shows partial filling (e.g., isolated colors like 7 at (1,9), 2s at (1,17/20), 9 at (2,6), 5s at (2,19/20), 6 at (3,3), 2s at (3,19/20), 1 at (5,13), 6s at (5,15/20), 8s at (7,17/20), 4 at (8,7), 7s at (8,18/20)), but many rows remain mostly empty (e.g., rows 0,4,6 all 0s, row 8 incomplete), suggesting possible under-filling or missed patterns in sparse areas.
 * The attempt correctly copies the input grid and only modifies via fills, preserving unchanged 0s.
 * No unhelpful functions; the core program is relevant and mostly functional, but lacks explicit handling for edge cases like all-zero rows/cols or non-starting patterns (assumes start at 0/bottom).
 * Subtle issue: In test, filling seems to stop prematurely (e.g., no extension beyond visible max_pos in some rows), possibly due to candidate filtering or GCD=1 leading to over-broad but under-colored candidates; unknown if this mismatches expected full patterns.
 * Training successes imply core GCD and mode logic is right, but test may need tweaks for sparser grids or multiple overlapping groups per row/col.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x21 grid (inferred from row lengths), with fills applied to some cells but leaving large empty areas (e.g., entire columns 0-5 mostly 0 except scattered; rows 0,4,6 all 0s), which may indicate incomplete pattern detection rather than a fully solved puzzle.
 * Specific effects: Row 1 fills 7 (col9), 2s (cols17,20) – possibly from a GCD pattern starting elsewhere, but no fill between 9-17 suggests d>1 or mismatched colors; row 2 has 9 (col6) isolated, 5s at end (19/20) – looks like short extension, but why not more candidates?; row 3 similar with 6 (col3) and 2s at end; row 5 has 1 (col13), 6s (15/20) – pattern detected but gaps (cols14,16 empty); row 7: 8s at end; row 8: 4 (col7), 7s at end – consistent with max_pos rule but potentially missing leftward fills if patterns start non-zero.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should likely have more contiguous fills (e.g., extending 5s or 2s leftward if GCD allows), as training successes suggest complete pattern resolution; here, many 0s persist where arithmetic extensions seem plausible (e.g., col20 has vertical 2-5-2-?-?-6-?-8-7 pattern, but vertical mode might underfill if bottom !=c or d invalid). Unknown exact expected grid, but sparsity suggests program missed some starting c's or over-skipped due to len(positions)<=1.
 * Positive: Fills match visible input hints (assuming input had these seeds), and no overfills (e.g., no coloring outside patterns); makes partial sense for sparse test but likely incomplete for a "solved" puzzle.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements (colored blocks with properties like color, position/bbox, and size/pixels). These are limited to patterns that hold across **all** train examples without exceptions—meaning they occur when the relevant conditions are met in a given example, and do not contradict or fail in any example (even if the condition is absent in some examples, making the interaction vacuous there). Only direct, observable effects (e.g., one property affecting another, like position influencing extension) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., unchanged singles with no apparent effect on/from others) are excluded. Non-obvious or inconsistent transformations (e.g., color changes in columns like greens to yellow in train 2, or additions like the blue at x=6 y=1 in train 1) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained consistently across all examples. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant details (e.g., background, overall layout) are inferred.

#### 1. **Vertical Multi-Pixel Components (Same Color, Same x, Spanning Multiple y) → Position/Size Extension (Upwards Filling)**
   - **Description**: A vertical bar (pixels >1, bbox showing same x but range in y, same color) interacts with its own position by extending upwards. The min y is set to 0, max y remains the original, and all positions in between are filled with the same color, forming a single larger vertical component (increased pixels, updated bbox).
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (original y-range) → new position (y from 0 to original max y) and size (pixels increase to fill the range).
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: No vertical multi-pixel components present, so no interaction occurs (consistent, no contradiction).
     - Train 2: Green vertical bar (x=9, y=7-8, pixels=2) extends to x=9, y=0-8, pixels=9.
     - Train 3: Red vertical bar (x=5, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends to x=5, y=0-6, pixels=7; Pink vertical bar (x=9, y=5-6, pixels=2) extends to x=9, y=0-6, pixels=7.
   - **Notes**: This is orientation-specific (vertical alignment triggers upwards extension). No color change involved. No holes or other shape properties affect this.

#### 2. **Horizontal Multi-Pixel Components (Same Color, Same y, Spanning Multiple x) → Position/Size Extension (Rightwards Filling)**
   - **Description**: A horizontal bar (pixels >1, bbox showing same y but range in x, same color) interacts with its own position by extending rightwards. The min x remains the original, max x is set to a fixed grid edge (observed as 8), and all positions in between are filled with the same color, forming a single larger horizontal component (increased pixels, updated bbox). (Note: In cases of conflict with other elements in the row, this may be overridden, but the extension attempt is consistent where no conflict.)
   - **Properties Involved**: Position (original x-range) → new position (x from original min to 8) and size (pixels increase to fill the range).
   - **Consistency Across All Train Examples**:
     - Train 1: Blue horizontal bar (y=4, x=0-1, pixels=2) extends to y=4, x=0-8, pixels=9. (The maroon horizontal bar at y=11, x=0-1, pixels=2 is overridden by another interaction but shows the extension pattern before override.)
     - Train 2: No horizontal multi-pixel components present, so no interaction occurs (consistent, no contradiction).
     - Train 3: No horizontal multi-pixel components present, so no interaction occurs (consistent, no contradiction).
   - **Notes**: This is orientation-specific (horizontal alignment triggers rightwards extension). No color change involved. No holes or other shape properties affect this. The fixed max x=8 is inferred from observed grid-like patterns (e.g., pixels=9 for full row).

#### Unknown or Inconsistent Interactions
- **Column-Based Color Changes (e.g., Same Column, Different y, Same or Different Colors) → Color or Addition**: Observed in train 2 (e.g., greens at x=2 y=5/8 change to yellow due to yellow at x=2 y=2; additions at y=0 in x=15/18) and train 3 (e.g., additions at y=0/2 in x=1, y=0 in x=13, matching existing red), but no similar effect in train 1 (e.g., blues at x=0 y=1/4 do not change or add vertically; light blue at x=0 y=8 changes to pink without clear column trigger). Cannot explain transformation consistently across all examples—called out as unknown.
- **Row-Based Additions or Color Propagation (e.g., Multiple Components in Same y) → Position/Color**: Observed in train 1 (e.g., light blues and pink at y=8 interact to add pink at x=4 and change light blues to pink; blues at y=1 add new blue at x=6), but no similar row additions or changes in train 2/3 (e.g., y=6 in train 3 has multiple reds/pink but no additions or changes within row). Not consistent across all examples—called out as unknown.
- **Overriding Between Row Elements (e.g., Single + Bar in Same y) → Color/Position**: Observed in train 1 (green single at y=11 x=7 overrides/changes the maroon bar at y=11 x=0-1, extending green left to x=0-7). No similar overriding in train 2/3 (no conflicting singles/bars in same row). Not consistent—called out as unknown.
- No consistent interactions involving holes (always 0, no effect observed), silhouettes/edges (all uniform pixelated blocks, no observable effect), or inter-color effects across rows/columns (e.g., no reliable color → color mapping like blue affecting green in all cases).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., position → movement without extension, or size → transformation) are identifiable without forcing non-existent connections. Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated singles with no effect on/from others, like orange at x=18 y=3 in train 2 remaining unchanged) are excluded.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 05:33:23] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle where the goal is to transform an input grid of numbers (representing colors, with 0 as empty) by processing lines (either rows horizontally or columns vertically) to identify and extend patterns based on exactly two occurrences of the same non-zero color separated by a distance d, filling adjacent zeros periodically with that color bidirectionally, while handling conflicts by overwriting the affected chain with the conflicting color and stopping extension in that direction. The processing direction is determined by the grid's aspect ratio (horizontal if taller than wide, vertical otherwise), and the transformation is applied once per line without iterating multiple passes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Only exactly two positions of the same color per line are processed as a pair; singles, triples, or larger groups are ignored entirely, even if they could form patterns.
 * Distance d is strictly p2 - p1 (absolute, after sorting positions); extensions step exactly by d in both directions (right: +d from p2, left: -d from p1), filling 0s or existing matches with color c, but stopping and overwriting only if a non-zero different color is encountered.
 * Conflicts cause overwriting of the directional chain (positions filled/extended in that direction, including originals if shared), but the code mutates in place, so processing order of colors (arbitrary via dict keys) can lead to unintended interactions if one color's extension overwrites another's pair.
 * Bidirectional extensions are handled separately per direction, but originals (p1, p2) must be carefully managed—subtly, including both originals in both left and right chains can cause over-overwriting (e.g., a right conflict incorrectly changes p1), which is a common miss; chains should be direction-specific (right chain starts from p1 to p2 + extensions, but overwrite only the extended part + affected originals if rules specify).
 * Direction choice: Horizontal for row-major (more rows than columns), vertical otherwise (including square or wide grids); this ensures efficient line processing but can miss if the puzzle requires both or multiple passes (though rules seem single-pass per direction).
 * No wrapping around grid edges; extensions stop at bounds.
 * Grid is list of lists, assumed rectangular; deep copy for safety in functions.
 * Subtle: If extension hits an existing c, it "extends" (sets again) and continues, but this could chain unexpectedly if multiple pairs overlap.
 * Ignores 0s initially for pair detection, but 0s are fillable; post-processing, lines may have new pairs created by extensions, but rules don't specify re-processing (single pass per line).
 * Potential for conflicts to propagate colors unexpectedly, e.g., overwriting a pair with a new color could create new pairs in later color processing.
 * Easy to miss: Process all colors in one scan per line, but mutations affect subsequent checks; sorting positions ensures consistent d > 0.
 * Overall: Puzzle emphasizes periodic extension like arithmetic sequences, with conflict resolution favoring the "blocking" color, but only for exact pairs—larger groups might be hints for manual solving but not auto-processed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

def process_line_inplace(l: List[int], n: int) -> None:
    """
    Core function: Groups positions by color, processes only exact pairs (len==2).
    Computes d = p2 - p1, extends right from p2 (+d steps) and left from p1 (-d steps).
    For each direction: Track chain positions separately (bug in current: shares originals incorrectly).
    On conflict (l[nextp] != 0 and != c), overwrite only that directional chain with conflict_c, stop.
    Mutates l in place; useful but needs fix for chain separation.
    """
    # (code as in attempt, but note: improve by making chain_right = set(range(p1, p2 + d, d)) or similar for full chain)
```

```python
def apply_horizontal_transformations(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Applies process_line_inplace to each row (horizontal lines).
    Deep copies grid first; ideal for tall grids (rows > cols).
    Helpful for row-wise puzzles.
    """
    # (code as in attempt)
```

```python
def apply_vertical_transformations(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Extracts columns as lists, applies process_line_inplace vertically (length = num_rows),
    reconstructs grid. Deep copies; for wide or square grids.
    Subtle: Column extraction [grid_copy[i][j] for i in range(num_rows)] is efficient.
    """
    # (code as in attempt)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first submission) correctly passed all three training examples, demonstrating core understanding of pair detection, distance-based extension into zeros, and conflict overwriting.
 * Successfully implemented direction selection based on aspect ratio (rows > cols → horizontal), which worked for training cases' grid shapes.
 * process_line_inplace correctly groups by color with defaultdict(list) and skips non-pairs, avoiding over-processing larger groups.
 * apply_horizontal_transformations and apply_vertical_transformations are well-structured for row/col processing with deep copies, preventing input mutation—essential for puzzle solvers.
 * However, chain tracking in process_line_inplace is broken: chain_right and chain_left both initialize with {p1, p2}, causing left extensions to incorrectly include p2 (and vice versa), leading to over-overwriting of originals on directional conflicts (e.g., right conflict changes left-side p1).
 * Leftward extension loop uses chain_left = {p1, p2} but only extends left from p1, so overwriting both on left conflict wrongly affects p2; same issue rightward.
 * Color processing order is arbitrary (list(pos_by_c.keys())), which worked for training but could fail if extensions create/break pairs in test (no re-scan after mutations).
 * No handling for d==0 (skipped, correct) or self-overlaps, but misses potential for full arithmetic sequence chains beyond just pairs (rules specify only exact two, so okay).
 * Overall, core logic for extension and conflict is present but subtly flawed in chain isolation, likely why test differs.
 * Functions like program() for composing transformations are helpful and modular—keep and refine.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 9x21 grid (inferred from list lengths) that remains mostly zeros, with isolated non-zeros like 7 at (1,9), 2 at (1,17), 6 at (1,20), 9 at (2,6), 5s at (2,19-20), 6 at (3,3) and (3,20), 1 at (5,13), 6s at (5,15) and (5,20), 8s at (7,17) and (7,20), 4 at (8,7), 7s at (8,18) and (8,20)—no visible extensions or fillings into zeros, suggesting either no valid pairs were detected in the input lines or the processing failed to extend.
 * This does not look correct: Expected output should show periodic fillings (e.g., if input had pairs like two 7s distance d apart, zeros between/around should fill with 7s, or conflicts propagate colors), but the output appears unchanged from a sparse input (assuming test input had these as originals), with no chains formed—differs from puzzle rules requiring bidirectional extension for pairs.
 * Subtly, positions like paired 5s at (2,19-20) or 6s at (3,3) and (3,20) look like potential d=1 or large d pairs, but no extension (e.g., no 5s left of col19 or 6s between col3-20), indicating the bug in chain/conflict or direction choice prevented proper processing; if vertical was chosen (21 cols > 9 rows, so yes), columns should extend vertically, but output shows no vertical fills (e.g., col20 has 0,6,6,0,6,0,8,0,? but no chaining).
 * Unknown why no changes: Possibly test input had no exact pairs, or mutations didn't trigger due to order/bug; regardless, it lacks the patterned completion expected (e.g., full lines or resolved conflicts), confirming incorrectness.
 * To handle test: Ensure chains are direction-specific (e.g., right_chain starts as {p1,p2} but only overwrite extended right positions + p2, not p1 unless full chain rule); consider processing colors in sorted order for determinism; verify vertical processing extracts/fills correctly.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 05:33:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
