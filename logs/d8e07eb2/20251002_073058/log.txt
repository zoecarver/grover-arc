=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 07:30:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 07:46:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

[2025-10-02 07:46:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 07:58:46] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based visual filling puzzle (similar to a nonogram or region-coloring challenge) on a 30x22 grid, where fixed digits (0-9 except 8) act as clues in specific "clue bands" or regions to determine how to fill blank cells (8's) with either 2 (likely one color, e.g., red) or 3 (another color, e.g., blue). The goal is to propagate fills based on detected patterns of these digits across horizontal/vertical bands, ensuring consistent region completion without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Scans top band for any 0 (triggers top/mid fills)

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Pairs with zero_top for top fill=3, bottom=3

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all-0 in left for horizontal left fill

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers vertical mid and blocks some lower fills

def has_seven_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15))  # Enables middle band right fill (cols 11-20)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(set(non_eight)) == 1 and non_eight and non_eight[0] == 9  # Strict: all non-8 must be 9 for vertical far fill

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper left vertical (rows 7-12, cols 1-6)

# Aggregator for 2's in upper band (useful for lower middle fill condition)
def any_two_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any_two_left(g) or any_two_mid(g) or any_two_right(g) or any_two_far(g)

def any_four_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 4 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers lower left vertical (rows 18-23, cols 1-6)

def is_full_block_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) == 9 and len(set(non_eight)) <= 1  # Full 3x3 non-8 block in left blocks lower middle row 22
```

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 08:05:43] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a grid with predefined borders (e.g., rows of 3s and 6s) and clue areas (numbers 0-9 in rows 1-3 and a bottom clue row), where the goal is to fill unknown cells (8s) with 3s in specific regions (upper, middle, lower sections divided into left/mid/right/far columns) based on conditional rules derived from the clues, such as presence or patterns of certain digits triggering fills in rectangular or shaped areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed borders: top and bottom rows are often filled with 3s; a row of 6s appears consistently around row 5 (0-indexed); side borders are 8s that may remain unfilled or get partial 3s based on conditions.
 * Clues are in rows 1-3 (columns 2-21, grouped into left:2-5, mid:7-10, right:12-15, far:17-20) and a bottom clue row (row 29?); conditions check for any/all specific digits (e.g., any 0 or 1 in top clues triggers top fills; full zeros in left triggers middle-left fill).
 * Regions to fill are vertically/horizontally divided: upper (rows 7-11), middle (12-17), lower (18-26?); subregions like left (cols 1-6), mid (6-11), right (11-16), far (16-21); fills are rectangular blocks of 3s but sometimes shaped (e.g., specific positions for 'nine' in far right).
 * Subtleties: Fills can extend vertically across sections (e.g., long mid from 8-27 if conditions met); some fills depend on negatives (e.g., not has_one_mid); is_nine_right checks for non-8s being all 9s, but may overfill or underfill shapes; bottom row fill color (2 or 3) depends on top conditions, but often mismatches expected.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs leave large areas of 8s unfilled (e.g., row 17 in training 1 is all 8s in expected but filled with 3s in generated); upper left has specific non-rectangular patterns (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with gaps); far right 'nine' shape is irregular (specific positions like (18,16),(18,18), etc.); interactions between clues (e.g., zero_top + one_top + not full_zero_left for upper mid).
 * All attempts fill too many 8s into 3s in places where expected leaves 8s (overfilling blocks); bottom row sometimes uses wrong color (3 vs expected 2? but not shown); no handling for cases where clues like 7/9/6 trigger partial shapes vs full blocks.
 * Grid dimensions: ~30 rows x 22 cols; indices start from 0, but clues in rows 1-3; fills avoid borders (col 0/21 often 8 or 3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top clues; useful for triggering top/bottom fills

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks if left clue block is entirely 0s; key for conditional left fills

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return bool(non_eight) and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Detects if right clue is purely 9s (ignoring 8s); triggers shaped far fills

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Presence check for 2 in left; triggers specific upper left pattern
```
These functions correctly detect clue conditions and are reusable; no types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall program structure calls fill functions in sequence on a copy of g, replacing 8s with 3s based on clue checks; this works for top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0/4/29 filled correctly in training 1) and some rectangular blocks (e.g., middle right if has_seven_right), but overfills (e.g., fills long_mid even when not extending fully).
 * Training 1: Generated fills row 17 (middle lower?) with all 3s, but expected leaves it all 8s; also fills upper far with 3s via is_nine_right, but expected has no such fill in rows 8-11 cols 16-21 (mismatch in far right extension); bottom row correct as 3s, but lower left-mid overfills cols 1-11 row 18-21 where expected has 8s in row 17.
 * Training 2: Generated fills upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 with 3s, but expected leaves row 7 cols 6-11 as 8s (partial overfill); middle left/right/far underfilled (e.g., row 13 cols 1-6 expected 3s but generated 8s? Wait, generated has 3s in some but not consistently); bottom row as 3s but expected may imply 2 (not shown, unknown); also fills row 11 cols 6-11 with 3s unexpectedly.
 * Training 3: Top clues not triggering top 3s (generated starts with 8s in row 0, expected 8s—correct); but overfills upper left rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with full 3s, expected has gaps/partial in row 8; middle section rows 12-17 mostly 8s but expected fills row 17 cols 1-6/16-21 with 3s (underfill); lower far rows 22-26 overfills with 3s via fill_lower_far_two, but expected has shaped 3s only in specific cols.
 * Training 4: Top not filled (correct, starts 8s); middle rows 12-17 overfills cols 1-6 and 11-16 with 3s via fill_middle_left/right, but expected leaves row 17 cols 6-11/16-21 as 8s; lower mid row 18 underfills (generated 8s in cols 1-5, expected 3s?); bottom row 2s correct? but generated has 6s row 5 correct.
 * Training 5: Top filled with 3s unexpectedly (generated row 0 3s, expected 8s—overfill); upper right overfills cols 16-20 rows 8-11 with 3s, expected partial; middle far underfills rows 12-17 cols 16-21 (8s, expected 3s in some); lower left-mid fills row 18 cols 1-11 with 3s correctly? but row 19 cols 16-20 mismatched (generated 3s in gaps).
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: fill_upper_left_specific (hardcodes positions but overfills gaps, e.g., row 8 cols 2/4 as 3s when expected 8s in some cases); fill_lower_far_nine (specific positions but applies unconditionally if is_nine_right, leading to mismatches like filling (18,17) which may not be expected); fill_long_mid (extends too far, e.g., to row 26 when expected stops at 17); fill_bottom (uses 3 always if top conditions, but some expected bottoms are 2s or unfilled—broken logic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills top rows 0-4 with 3s (expected likely 8s based on training 3/4/5 patterns where top clues like 0/1/9 don't always trigger full top fill); upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 filled fully with 3s, but likely partial or none needed (similar to training 2 underfill issue); middle rows 12-17 cols 1-6 filled but row 12 cols 6-11/16-21 left 8s (underfill, expected shaped based on bottom clues 0/6?); lower far rows 22-26 has partial 3s in cols 16-21 but gaps like row 22 col 17=8 (mismatch, looks like incomplete 'nine' shape); bottom row 29 not shown but implied 3s, may be wrong if test clues suggest 2; overall, too many 3s in left/mid, leaving right/far inconsistent—does not make sense as it ignores negative conditions (e.g., not full_zero_left) and shaped fills.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:05:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based visual filling puzzle (similar to a nonogram or region-coloring challenge) on a 30x22 grid, where fixed digits (0-9 except 8) act as clues in specific "clue bands" or regions to determine how to fill blank cells (8's) with either 2 (likely one color, e.g., red) or 3 (another color, e.g., blue). The goal is to propagate fills based on detected patterns of these digits across horizontal/vertical bands, ensuring consistent region completion without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Scans top band for any 0 (triggers top/mid fills)

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Pairs with zero_top for top fill=3, bottom=3

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all-0 in left for horizontal left fill

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers vertical mid and blocks some lower fills

def has_seven_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15))  # Enables middle band right fill (cols 11-20)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(set(non_eight)) == 1 and non_eight and non_eight[0] == 9  # Strict: all non-8 must be 9 for vertical far fill

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper left vertical (rows 7-12, cols 1-6)

# Aggregator for 2's in upper band (useful for lower middle fill condition)
def any_two_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any_two_left(g) or any_two_mid(g) or any_two_right(g) or any_two_far(g)

def any_four_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 4 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers lower left vertical (rows 18-23, cols 1-6)

def is_full_block_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) == 9 and len(set(non_eight)) <= 1  # Full 3x3 non-8 block in left blocks lower middle row 22
```

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a grid with predefined borders (e.g., rows of 3s and 6s) and clue areas (numbers 0-9 in rows 1-3 and a bottom clue row), where the goal is to fill unknown cells (8s) with 3s in specific regions (upper, middle, lower sections divided into left/mid/right/far columns) based on conditional rules derived from the clues, such as presence or patterns of certain digits triggering fills in rectangular or shaped areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed borders: top and bottom rows are often filled with 3s; a row of 6s appears consistently around row 5 (0-indexed); side borders are 8s that may remain unfilled or get partial 3s based on conditions.
 * Clues are in rows 1-3 (columns 2-21, grouped into left:2-5, mid:7-10, right:12-15, far:17-20) and a bottom clue row (row 29?); conditions check for any/all specific digits (e.g., any 0 or 1 in top clues triggers top fills; full zeros in left triggers middle-left fill).
 * Regions to fill are vertically/horizontally divided: upper (rows 7-11), middle (12-17), lower (18-26?); subregions like left (cols 1-6), mid (6-11), right (11-16), far (16-21); fills are rectangular blocks of 3s but sometimes shaped (e.g., specific positions for 'nine' in far right).
 * Subtleties: Fills can extend vertically across sections (e.g., long mid from 8-27 if conditions met); some fills depend on negatives (e.g., not has_one_mid); is_nine_right checks for non-8s being all 9s, but may overfill or underfill shapes; bottom row fill color (2 or 3) depends on top conditions, but often mismatches expected.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs leave large areas of 8s unfilled (e.g., row 17 in training 1 is all 8s in expected but filled with 3s in generated); upper left has specific non-rectangular patterns (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with gaps); far right 'nine' shape is irregular (specific positions like (18,16),(18,18), etc.); interactions between clues (e.g., zero_top + one_top + not full_zero_left for upper mid).
 * All attempts fill too many 8s into 3s in places where expected leaves 8s (overfilling blocks); bottom row sometimes uses wrong color (3 vs expected 2? but not shown); no handling for cases where clues like 7/9/6 trigger partial shapes vs full blocks.
 * Grid dimensions: ~30 rows x 22 cols; indices start from 0, but clues in rows 1-3; fills avoid borders (col 0/21 often 8 or 3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top clues; useful for triggering top/bottom fills

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks if left clue block is entirely 0s; key for conditional left fills

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return bool(non_eight) and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Detects if right clue is purely 9s (ignoring 8s); triggers shaped far fills

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Presence check for 2 in left; triggers specific upper left pattern
```
These functions correctly detect clue conditions and are reusable; no types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall program structure calls fill functions in sequence on a copy of g, replacing 8s with 3s based on clue checks; this works for top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0/4/29 filled correctly in training 1) and some rectangular blocks (e.g., middle right if has_seven_right), but overfills (e.g., fills long_mid even when not extending fully).
 * Training 1: Generated fills row 17 (middle lower?) with all 3s, but expected leaves it all 8s; also fills upper far with 3s via is_nine_right, but expected has no such fill in rows 8-11 cols 16-21 (mismatch in far right extension); bottom row correct as 3s, but lower left-mid overfills cols 1-11 row 18-21 where expected has 8s in row 17.
 * Training 2: Generated fills upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 with 3s, but expected leaves row 7 cols 6-11 as 8s (partial overfill); middle left/right/far underfilled (e.g., row 13 cols 1-6 expected 3s but generated 8s? Wait, generated has 3s in some but not consistently); bottom row as 3s but expected may imply 2 (not shown, unknown); also fills row 11 cols 6-11 with 3s unexpectedly.
 * Training 3: Top clues not triggering top 3s (generated starts with 8s in row 0, expected 8s—correct); but overfills upper left rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with full 3s, expected has gaps/partial in row 8; middle section rows 12-17 mostly 8s but expected fills row 17 cols 1-6/16-21 with 3s (underfill); lower far rows 22-26 overfills with 3s via fill_lower_far_two, but expected has shaped 3s only in specific cols.
 * Training 4: Top not filled (correct, starts 8s); middle rows 12-17 overfills cols 1-6 and 11-16 with 3s via fill_middle_left/right, but expected leaves row 17 cols 6-11/16-21 as 8s; lower mid row 18 underfills (generated 8s in cols 1-5, expected 3s?); bottom row 2s correct? but generated has 6s row 5 correct.
 * Training 5: Top filled with 3s unexpectedly (generated row 0 3s, expected 8s—overfill); upper right overfills cols 16-20 rows 8-11 with 3s, expected partial; middle far underfills rows 12-17 cols 16-21 (8s, expected 3s in some); lower left-mid fills row 18 cols 1-11 with 3s correctly? but row 19 cols 16-20 mismatched (generated 3s in gaps).
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: fill_upper_left_specific (hardcodes positions but overfills gaps, e.g., row 8 cols 2/4 as 3s when expected 8s in some cases); fill_lower_far_nine (specific positions but applies unconditionally if is_nine_right, leading to mismatches like filling (18,17) which may not be expected); fill_long_mid (extends too far, e.g., to row 26 when expected stops at 17); fill_bottom (uses 3 always if top conditions, but some expected bottoms are 2s or unfilled—broken logic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills top rows 0-4 with 3s (expected likely 8s based on training 3/4/5 patterns where top clues like 0/1/9 don't always trigger full top fill); upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 filled fully with 3s, but likely partial or none needed (similar to training 2 underfill issue); middle rows 12-17 cols 1-6 filled but row 12 cols 6-11/16-21 left 8s (underfill, expected shaped based on bottom clues 0/6?); lower far rows 22-26 has partial 3s in cols 16-21 but gaps like row 22 col 17=8 (mismatch, looks like incomplete 'nine' shape); bottom row 29 not shown but implied 3s, may be wrong if test clues suggest 2; overall, too many 3s in left/mid, leaving right/far inconsistent—does not make sense as it ignores negative conditions (e.g., not full_zero_left) and shaped fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)

[2025-10-02 08:10:39] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where fixed digits (0-9, 6's on certain rows) provide clues to fill blank spaces (8's) with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on pattern-matching conditions derived from the positions and combinations of those digits; the goal is to replicate exact expected fillings across training examples, likely simulating rules for shading or completing a hidden image/diagram without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are often fully filled with 3's or 2's based on top/bottom conditions; row 5 and 29 are always 6's; rows 6-7 and some lower rows start as 8's but may get filled; the puzzle divides into vertical sections (left: cols 1-6, mid: 6-11, right: 11-21) and horizontal bands (upper: rows 8-12, middle: 12-18/23, lower: 18-28).
 * Filling only occurs where 8's exist—never overwrite non-8 cells; use value 3 for fills, but some conditions lead to 2's (e.g., bottom if no zero/one top).
 * Conditions are conditional and sometimes mutually exclusive: e.g., long vertical mid fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if one in mid AND two far-right; upper far-right fill if mostly 9's in right (not all 8's); bottom far if two far AND no one mid.
 * Subtle overlaps/conflicts: multiple fills can overlap (e.g., middle mid and long mid both target mid section, but order matters to avoid partial fills); some regions like lower left-mid (rows 17-23, cols 1-11) only if four in mid, but this may conflict with other middle fills.
 * Digit detection is row-restricted (e.g., tops in rows 1-4, cols 0-22; mid in rows 1-4, cols 7-11; left in cols 2-5/6; right in cols 12-16/17-21); "full zero left" requires ALL zeros in a subregion, while others are "any" (existence).
 * Easy to miss: "is_nine_right" checks for non-8 cells in right being ALL 9's (not just any 9); no fill if condition partial (e.g., mixed 7/8/9 in right doesn't trigger nine fill); bottom row fill to 2's if no zero AND one top; some examples have pre-filled 3's outside 8's, so program must copy input faithfully.
 * Across attempts: order of fill functions matters (early fills like top/bottom set global, later ones like middle may depend); unhandled cases like pre-existing 3's in input (e.g., training 3 has them in row 7) can cause mismatches if not copied; right section fills are tricky (e.g., seven_right any 7 triggers wide middle right, but nine_right needs purity).
 * General: Puzzle emphasizes precision—small mismatches (e.g., one cell wrong) fail the example; test cases vary in digit placements, so rules must generalize without hardcoding per-example.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 17 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (middle left over-filled, likely due to full_zero_left triggering despite context); also filled row 28-29 with 3's but expected 2's in some spots? Wait, actually bottoms match, but row 17 mismatch suggests middle_left fill ignores upper/middle interactions; subtle: expected has 8's in row 17 left, so condition like full_zero_left may be too broad or misranged (cols 2-5 vs 1-6).
 * Training example 2 CORRECT: All fills matched exactly, indicating core top/bottom, upper left (if two left), long mid (if one mid + two far), upper far (if nine right), middle sections, lower left-mid (if four mid), lower mid (if two mid), and lower far (if two far no one mid) worked perfectly here—likely because this example had clean, non-overlapping conditions without pre-filled 3's.
 * Training example 3 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 7 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (upper left triggered wrongly? Input has no two left in rows 1-4? Wait, input row 1-3 have 2's in left, but perhaps range issue); also row 23 (cols 1-6) filled with 3's expected 8's (lower left overreach); row 24 has extra 3's in right where expected 8's (long mid or middle right spillover); bottom rows 30-31 are 2's matching, but upper/middle mismatches suggest mishandling pre-existing 3's in row 7 or incorrect any_two_left detection.
 * Training example 4 INCORRECT: Generated row 17 (cols 1-6 and 6-11) filled with 3's where expected 8's in left-mid (middle left/mid triggered wrongly, perhaps full_zero_left false but still filled? Input has zeros left but not full; also row 18 over-filled); row 22-23 have partial 3's in left where expected 8's (lower left-mid if four mid, but input has no 4 mid? Mismatch unknown); row 24 empty matching, but middle sections differ by entire bands.
 * Training example 5 INCORRECT: Generated row 7 all 8's matching, but row 8 right has 3's interspersed (e.g., col 16-21) where expected none (upper far triggered wrongly—input has 9's in right but mixed with 3's? is_nine_right fails purity); row 12 filled left-mid with 3's expected 8's (middle left/mid over); row 17-18 filled with 3's expected partial; row 23 right has 3's where expected 8's (lower far triggered despite one mid present?); bottoms 3's but input suggests 2's possible.
 * Overall: Works for clean cases (ex 2) but fails on overlaps/pre-fills (ex 3-5) and strict conditions (ex 1,4); fill order helps but misses exclusions (e.g., don't fill if region already partial); no extraction of full objects, but detection funcs are solid—unhelpful: none really broken, but is_nine_right too narrow (cols 12-16 only, misses far-right 17-21); full_zero_left range (2-5) may need tweak to 1-6 for some.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-fills row 7 (cols 6-11) with 3's where likely expected 8's (long mid triggered, but input has one mid in rows 1-4 cols 7-11, yet two far present—condition may need stricter check); row 8-11 left/mid/right have 3's interspersed (e.g., cols 1-6,6-11,16-21) matching some upper fills, but cols 12-16 empty where seven_right absent (no 7's, correct no fill); row 12 left empty but mid empty (middle mid if one mid, but perhaps blocked by long mid?); row 17-18 over-filled mid/right with 3's expected partial/empty (middle right if seven, but no 7); row 22-23 left-mid filled if four mid (input has 4's in rows 18-20? Wait, clues in 1-4, but lower detect any_four_mid); row 24-27 right has 3's in cols 16-21 expected empty (lower far if two far no one mid, but one mid present); bottoms 3's due to zero/one top present, seems correct; overall, too many 3's in middle/lower, suggesting program fills without checking for pre-3's or condition negations, and test likely expects sparser fills like training 3/4.

[2025-10-02 08:10:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based visual filling puzzle (similar to a nonogram or region-coloring challenge) on a 30x22 grid, where fixed digits (0-9 except 8) act as clues in specific "clue bands" or regions to determine how to fill blank cells (8's) with either 2 (likely one color, e.g., red) or 3 (another color, e.g., blue). The goal is to propagate fills based on detected patterns of these digits across horizontal/vertical bands, ensuring consistent region completion without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Scans top band for any 0 (triggers top/mid fills)

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Pairs with zero_top for top fill=3, bottom=3

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all-0 in left for horizontal left fill

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers vertical mid and blocks some lower fills

def has_seven_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15))  # Enables middle band right fill (cols 11-20)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(set(non_eight)) == 1 and non_eight and non_eight[0] == 9  # Strict: all non-8 must be 9 for vertical far fill

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper left vertical (rows 7-12, cols 1-6)

# Aggregator for 2's in upper band (useful for lower middle fill condition)
def any_two_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any_two_left(g) or any_two_mid(g) or any_two_right(g) or any_two_far(g)

def any_four_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 4 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers lower left vertical (rows 18-23, cols 1-6)

def is_full_block_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) == 9 and len(set(non_eight)) <= 1  # Full 3x3 non-8 block in left blocks lower middle row 22
```

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a grid with predefined borders (e.g., rows of 3s and 6s) and clue areas (numbers 0-9 in rows 1-3 and a bottom clue row), where the goal is to fill unknown cells (8s) with 3s in specific regions (upper, middle, lower sections divided into left/mid/right/far columns) based on conditional rules derived from the clues, such as presence or patterns of certain digits triggering fills in rectangular or shaped areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed borders: top and bottom rows are often filled with 3s; a row of 6s appears consistently around row 5 (0-indexed); side borders are 8s that may remain unfilled or get partial 3s based on conditions.
 * Clues are in rows 1-3 (columns 2-21, grouped into left:2-5, mid:7-10, right:12-15, far:17-20) and a bottom clue row (row 29?); conditions check for any/all specific digits (e.g., any 0 or 1 in top clues triggers top fills; full zeros in left triggers middle-left fill).
 * Regions to fill are vertically/horizontally divided: upper (rows 7-11), middle (12-17), lower (18-26?); subregions like left (cols 1-6), mid (6-11), right (11-16), far (16-21); fills are rectangular blocks of 3s but sometimes shaped (e.g., specific positions for 'nine' in far right).
 * Subtleties: Fills can extend vertically across sections (e.g., long mid from 8-27 if conditions met); some fills depend on negatives (e.g., not has_one_mid); is_nine_right checks for non-8s being all 9s, but may overfill or underfill shapes; bottom row fill color (2 or 3) depends on top conditions, but often mismatches expected.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs leave large areas of 8s unfilled (e.g., row 17 in training 1 is all 8s in expected but filled with 3s in generated); upper left has specific non-rectangular patterns (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with gaps); far right 'nine' shape is irregular (specific positions like (18,16),(18,18), etc.); interactions between clues (e.g., zero_top + one_top + not full_zero_left for upper mid).
 * All attempts fill too many 8s into 3s in places where expected leaves 8s (overfilling blocks); bottom row sometimes uses wrong color (3 vs expected 2? but not shown); no handling for cases where clues like 7/9/6 trigger partial shapes vs full blocks.
 * Grid dimensions: ~30 rows x 22 cols; indices start from 0, but clues in rows 1-3; fills avoid borders (col 0/21 often 8 or 3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top clues; useful for triggering top/bottom fills

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks if left clue block is entirely 0s; key for conditional left fills

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return bool(non_eight) and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Detects if right clue is purely 9s (ignoring 8s); triggers shaped far fills

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Presence check for 2 in left; triggers specific upper left pattern
```
These functions correctly detect clue conditions and are reusable; no types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall program structure calls fill functions in sequence on a copy of g, replacing 8s with 3s based on clue checks; this works for top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0/4/29 filled correctly in training 1) and some rectangular blocks (e.g., middle right if has_seven_right), but overfills (e.g., fills long_mid even when not extending fully).
 * Training 1: Generated fills row 17 (middle lower?) with all 3s, but expected leaves it all 8s; also fills upper far with 3s via is_nine_right, but expected has no such fill in rows 8-11 cols 16-21 (mismatch in far right extension); bottom row correct as 3s, but lower left-mid overfills cols 1-11 row 18-21 where expected has 8s in row 17.
 * Training 2: Generated fills upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 with 3s, but expected leaves row 7 cols 6-11 as 8s (partial overfill); middle left/right/far underfilled (e.g., row 13 cols 1-6 expected 3s but generated 8s? Wait, generated has 3s in some but not consistently); bottom row as 3s but expected may imply 2 (not shown, unknown); also fills row 11 cols 6-11 with 3s unexpectedly.
 * Training 3: Top clues not triggering top 3s (generated starts with 8s in row 0, expected 8s—correct); but overfills upper left rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with full 3s, expected has gaps/partial in row 8; middle section rows 12-17 mostly 8s but expected fills row 17 cols 1-6/16-21 with 3s (underfill); lower far rows 22-26 overfills with 3s via fill_lower_far_two, but expected has shaped 3s only in specific cols.
 * Training 4: Top not filled (correct, starts 8s); middle rows 12-17 overfills cols 1-6 and 11-16 with 3s via fill_middle_left/right, but expected leaves row 17 cols 6-11/16-21 as 8s; lower mid row 18 underfills (generated 8s in cols 1-5, expected 3s?); bottom row 2s correct? but generated has 6s row 5 correct.
 * Training 5: Top filled with 3s unexpectedly (generated row 0 3s, expected 8s—overfill); upper right overfills cols 16-20 rows 8-11 with 3s, expected partial; middle far underfills rows 12-17 cols 16-21 (8s, expected 3s in some); lower left-mid fills row 18 cols 1-11 with 3s correctly? but row 19 cols 16-20 mismatched (generated 3s in gaps).
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: fill_upper_left_specific (hardcodes positions but overfills gaps, e.g., row 8 cols 2/4 as 3s when expected 8s in some cases); fill_lower_far_nine (specific positions but applies unconditionally if is_nine_right, leading to mismatches like filling (18,17) which may not be expected); fill_long_mid (extends too far, e.g., to row 26 when expected stops at 17); fill_bottom (uses 3 always if top conditions, but some expected bottoms are 2s or unfilled—broken logic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills top rows 0-4 with 3s (expected likely 8s based on training 3/4/5 patterns where top clues like 0/1/9 don't always trigger full top fill); upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 filled fully with 3s, but likely partial or none needed (similar to training 2 underfill issue); middle rows 12-17 cols 1-6 filled but row 12 cols 6-11/16-21 left 8s (underfill, expected shaped based on bottom clues 0/6?); lower far rows 22-26 has partial 3s in cols 16-21 but gaps like row 22 col 17=8 (mismatch, looks like incomplete 'nine' shape); bottom row 29 not shown but implied 3s, may be wrong if test clues suggest 2; overall, too many 3s in left/mid, leaving right/far inconsistent—does not make sense as it ignores negative conditions (e.g., not full_zero_left) and shaped fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where fixed digits (0-9, 6's on certain rows) provide clues to fill blank spaces (8's) with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on pattern-matching conditions derived from the positions and combinations of those digits; the goal is to replicate exact expected fillings across training examples, likely simulating rules for shading or completing a hidden image/diagram without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are often fully filled with 3's or 2's based on top/bottom conditions; row 5 and 29 are always 6's; rows 6-7 and some lower rows start as 8's but may get filled; the puzzle divides into vertical sections (left: cols 1-6, mid: 6-11, right: 11-21) and horizontal bands (upper: rows 8-12, middle: 12-18/23, lower: 18-28).
 * Filling only occurs where 8's exist—never overwrite non-8 cells; use value 3 for fills, but some conditions lead to 2's (e.g., bottom if no zero/one top).
 * Conditions are conditional and sometimes mutually exclusive: e.g., long vertical mid fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if one in mid AND two far-right; upper far-right fill if mostly 9's in right (not all 8's); bottom far if two far AND no one mid.
 * Subtle overlaps/conflicts: multiple fills can overlap (e.g., middle mid and long mid both target mid section, but order matters to avoid partial fills); some regions like lower left-mid (rows 17-23, cols 1-11) only if four in mid, but this may conflict with other middle fills.
 * Digit detection is row-restricted (e.g., tops in rows 1-4, cols 0-22; mid in rows 1-4, cols 7-11; left in cols 2-5/6; right in cols 12-16/17-21); "full zero left" requires ALL zeros in a subregion, while others are "any" (existence).
 * Easy to miss: "is_nine_right" checks for non-8 cells in right being ALL 9's (not just any 9); no fill if condition partial (e.g., mixed 7/8/9 in right doesn't trigger nine fill); bottom row fill to 2's if no zero AND one top; some examples have pre-filled 3's outside 8's, so program must copy input faithfully.
 * Across attempts: order of fill functions matters (early fills like top/bottom set global, later ones like middle may depend); unhandled cases like pre-existing 3's in input (e.g., training 3 has them in row 7) can cause mismatches if not copied; right section fills are tricky (e.g., seven_right any 7 triggers wide middle right, but nine_right needs purity).
 * General: Puzzle emphasizes precision—small mismatches (e.g., one cell wrong) fail the example; test cases vary in digit placements, so rules must generalize without hardcoding per-example.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 17 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (middle left over-filled, likely due to full_zero_left triggering despite context); also filled row 28-29 with 3's but expected 2's in some spots? Wait, actually bottoms match, but row 17 mismatch suggests middle_left fill ignores upper/middle interactions; subtle: expected has 8's in row 17 left, so condition like full_zero_left may be too broad or misranged (cols 2-5 vs 1-6).
 * Training example 2 CORRECT: All fills matched exactly, indicating core top/bottom, upper left (if two left), long mid (if one mid + two far), upper far (if nine right), middle sections, lower left-mid (if four mid), lower mid (if two mid), and lower far (if two far no one mid) worked perfectly here—likely because this example had clean, non-overlapping conditions without pre-filled 3's.
 * Training example 3 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 7 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (upper left triggered wrongly? Input has no two left in rows 1-4? Wait, input row 1-3 have 2's in left, but perhaps range issue); also row 23 (cols 1-6) filled with 3's expected 8's (lower left overreach); row 24 has extra 3's in right where expected 8's (long mid or middle right spillover); bottom rows 30-31 are 2's matching, but upper/middle mismatches suggest mishandling pre-existing 3's in row 7 or incorrect any_two_left detection.
 * Training example 4 INCORRECT: Generated row 17 (cols 1-6 and 6-11) filled with 3's where expected 8's in left-mid (middle left/mid triggered wrongly, perhaps full_zero_left false but still filled? Input has zeros left but not full; also row 18 over-filled); row 22-23 have partial 3's in left where expected 8's (lower left-mid if four mid, but input has no 4 mid? Mismatch unknown); row 24 empty matching, but middle sections differ by entire bands.
 * Training example 5 INCORRECT: Generated row 7 all 8's matching, but row 8 right has 3's interspersed (e.g., col 16-21) where expected none (upper far triggered wrongly—input has 9's in right but mixed with 3's? is_nine_right fails purity); row 12 filled left-mid with 3's expected 8's (middle left/mid over); row 17-18 filled with 3's expected partial; row 23 right has 3's where expected 8's (lower far triggered despite one mid present?); bottoms 3's but input suggests 2's possible.
 * Overall: Works for clean cases (ex 2) but fails on overlaps/pre-fills (ex 3-5) and strict conditions (ex 1,4); fill order helps but misses exclusions (e.g., don't fill if region already partial); no extraction of full objects, but detection funcs are solid—unhelpful: none really broken, but is_nine_right too narrow (cols 12-16 only, misses far-right 17-21); full_zero_left range (2-5) may need tweak to 1-6 for some.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-fills row 7 (cols 6-11) with 3's where likely expected 8's (long mid triggered, but input has one mid in rows 1-4 cols 7-11, yet two far present—condition may need stricter check); row 8-11 left/mid/right have 3's interspersed (e.g., cols 1-6,6-11,16-21) matching some upper fills, but cols 12-16 empty where seven_right absent (no 7's, correct no fill); row 12 left empty but mid empty (middle mid if one mid, but perhaps blocked by long mid?); row 17-18 over-filled mid/right with 3's expected partial/empty (middle right if seven, but no 7); row 22-23 left-mid filled if four mid (input has 4's in rows 18-20? Wait, clues in 1-4, but lower detect any_four_mid); row 24-27 right has 3's in cols 16-21 expected empty (lower far if two far no one mid, but one mid present); bottoms 3's due to zero/one top present, seems correct; overall, too many 3's in middle/lower, suggesting program fills without checking for pre-3's or condition negations, and test likely expects sparser fills like training 3/4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:

            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:16:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) with fixed structural elements (e.g., bands of 3s, 2s, or 6s in specific rows) and clue numbers (0,1,2,7,9) placed in certain positions, where the goal is to replace all 8s (unknown cells) with either 2 or 3 to form coherent regions or "blobs" based on positional rules and interactions between clues. The filling rules appear to propagate from clue conditions to fill rectangular regions, with 3 often indicating a "primary" or connected fill and 2 a "secondary" or default fill, while avoiding overfilling or conflicting with existing clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed bands: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are horizontal bands filled entirely with 3 or 2; row 5 and row 30 are always full 6s (perhaps dividers or walls); rows 6-7 and 25-27 often start as 8s but get partial fills.
 * Clues (0,1,2,7,9) are checked in specific subregions (e.g., "top" clues in rows 1-3, cols 0-21 for 0/1/2; "left" in cols 2-4; "mid" in cols 7-10; "right" in cols 12-15 or 16-20), and conditions like "has_zero_top" or "is_nine_right" (which requires all non-8s in a region to be 9 and at least one present) trigger fills only in 8s within target rectangles.
 * Subtleties include conditional dependencies: e.g., bottom band fills with 3 only if top clues have both 0 and 1; upper left fill extends to col 6 under specific 2 placements; long mid (rows 8-26, cols 6-10) requires both 1 in mid and 2 in far right; row 17 mid fill depends on negation (not full_zero_left); lower far has early/late variants based on 1-left vs. (2-far and not 1-mid).
 * Order of function calls in program() matters, as fills only target 8s and later fills can overwrite if regions overlap (though current code avoids this by sequential non-overlapping regions).
 * Easy-to-miss: Fills are rectangular but sometimes partial (e.g., upper left adds col 6 conditionally); "full_zero_left" requires all three cells in rows 1-3, cols 2-4 to be 0 (not any); no fills touch clue positions (preserves 0/1/2/7/9); bottom rows 28-29 default to 2 unless top condition met; some regions like middle right (rows 12-16, cols 11-20) fill broadly if 7 in right.
 * Across attempts, issues include overfilling (e.g., filling where clues block or conditions not fully met), underfilling (e.g., missing propagations to adjacent cols like 6 or 11), ignoring negations (e.g., not full_zero_left), and mishandling "is_nine_right" (fills even if mixed non-8s). Test cases highlight sensitivity to clue interactions across vertical bands (left/mid/right).
 * No rotation or symmetry assumed; all checks are absolute positions. 8s outside defined regions may remain unfilled, but expectations show all 8s filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current code uses simple any/all comprehensions for conditions, which are helpful for quick regional checks. No complex types or extractions needed yet, but potential for region-specific validators.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks entire top band for 0 (helpful for global top/bottom trigger)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Useful for strict "all clues are 9" without 8s interfering

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(r_start, r_end + 1):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Core filling tool; only targets 8s, preserves clues
```

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_upper_far` relies on `is_nine_right` which may misfire if region has 8s mixed with non-9s (it collects non-8s correctly but assumes presence implies fill—subtle bug in some cases). `fill_row17_mid` uses complex negation which failed in Train3/5. No object extraction functions present or needed; simple grid iteration suffices.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct—properly filled top/bottom bands with 3s (due to 0/1 top presence), upper/middle/lower regions with 3s based on 2-left, 1-mid, 7-right, etc.; no over/underfills observed.
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated extra 3s in row7 cols6-10 (should be 8s, as no long_mid trigger without 2-far?); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left requires full_zero_left, which isn't met); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (condition (has_one_mid and not full_zero_left) or any_two_mid not fully satisfied); row22 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (no upper_left propagation?); overall, overfilled mid/left regions without strict conditions.
 * Train3: Incorrect—underfilled row7 (expected 3s in cols1-5, but generated 8s—upper_left missed due to no 2-left? Wait, clues have 2s there); row11 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left overtriggered); row16 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle regions missed); row17 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s in cols6-10 only? No, expectations show row17 all 8s except mid 3s—generated missed mid; row18 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s initially then propagated; bottom rows 30-31 are 2s as expected but top clues lacked 0/1 pair? Major issue: left/mid fills inconsistent with negations and propagations.
 * Train4: Correct—handled complex interactions like 1-left triggering lower_far_early, 2-top for lower_mid, etc.; all regions filled precisely without extras.
 * Train5: Incorrect—row12 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_mid triggered wrongly without strict 1-mid?); row16 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle_left missed); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (row17_mid overtriggered); row21 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_left/mid missed due to no 2-left/top?); row22 all 8s but expected partial 3s in lower; overfilled some right regions with 3s where 8s expected (e.g., row8-11 cols16-20).
 * General: Conditions like full_zero_left and negations (not full_zero_left) often fail, leading to missed or extra mid fills; upper_far works when 9s present but not if mixed; long_mid undertriggers without 2-far; no function for extracting full clue regions (e.g., to validate blob shapes), which might help debug; fill order causes no overwrites but misses chained fills (e.g., upper to middle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—while top/bottom bands are properly 3s (due to 0-top and 1-top present), and some regions like upper left (rows8-11 cols1-5=3s), middle mid (rows12-16 cols6-10=3s), lower left/mid (rows18-21 cols1-5/6-10=3s) match expectations, there are mismatches: row7 cols1-5 are 8s but should be 3s (upper_left trigger from 2-left present, but code's any_two_left should catch it—possible col range issue in fill_upper_left); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but if not full_zero_left (clues show mixed 0s), expected 8s; row22 cols16-20 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_far_late should trigger from 2-far and not 1-mid? Clues have 2s far right); row24-26 cols16-20 partial 3s but code filled full, mismatching sparse 2-clue positions; overall, underfills vertical propagations (e.g., row22-26 left/mid should chain from upper) and overfills bottom mid without negation check; does not make complete sense as some 8s remain (e.g., row7, row22 partial), violating full-fill expectation, and ignores subtle extensions like col6 in upper left.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:16:53] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Background and Borders**: Maroon/purple background panels; pink, green, or purple horizontal border strips at top and bottom.
- **Black Elements**: Solid square (multiple instances); inverted L-shape (H-like); solid block in grids.
- **Blue Elements**: H-like (II or Π); T-shape; L-shape; C-shape; square with extension (K-like); straight bar; U-shape inverted (n-like).
- **Pink/Magenta Elements**: ]-shape; L-shape vertical; J-shape; solid square; N-shape; plus cross.
- **Purple Elements**: X-shape; L-shape; T-shape rotated.
- **Red Elements**: X-shape; T-shape; plus cross.
- **Yellow Elements**: U-shape; L-shape.
- **Orange Elements**: + cross; solid square (O-like).
- **Green Elements**: ]-shape; J-shape; border accents (in output variants).
- **Cyan/Teal Elements**: L-shape; square with notch (K-like); B-like or 8-like; straight with hook.
- **Grid Structure**: 4x4 arrangement of shapes within bordered panels; positions vary slightly between input (purple/green borders) and output (mixed borders), with shapes like squares, L/T/I/polyominoes rearranged or recolored.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Only interactions and connections that are consistent across **every** provided train example (1-5) are listed below. These are based on direct, observable changes between each input and its corresponding output. No high-level puzzle solution or interpretation is provided. Irrelevant or unchanged elements (e.g., small Red pixels at fixed positions like [2,8], Light Blue components, lower-panel shapes like Blue [7,18,9,20] or Yellow [2,18,4,20], and static Pink borders at y=5 and y=27) show no consistent interaction or transformation, so they are excluded. Transformations that occur in only some examples (e.g., top Maroon [0,0,21,4] color change to Green, bottom border [0,28,21,29] color change to Green or Red, or single-pixel Maroon [18,24,18,24] color change) are not included, as they are not present in every case. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact rule for how top elements determine Green properties) are noted as such.

1. **Middle Maroon Component ([0,6,21,26]) → New Green Components (multiple, variable bboxes within [0,6,21,26])**:
   - **Color transformation**: Pixels from the middle Maroon component are consistently recolored to Green, creating one or more new Green components. This occurs in every example.
   - **Pixel count effect**: The total pixels in all new Green components exactly equals the reduction in pixels of the middle Maroon component (input always 363 pixels; output varies but decrease matches Green total: e.g., 74 in trains 1-3, 75 in train 4, 55 in train 5).
   - **Position containment**: All new Green components have bboxes fully contained within the middle Maroon's bbox ([0,6,21,26]). No Green pixels appear outside this area.
   - **Holes effect**: The middle Maroon's hole count decreases (e.g., from 23 to 20, 19, 17, 22, or 20), while new Green components have their own hole counts (total Green holes vary: e.g., 4, 4, 8, 4, 6). No consistent additive or subtractive relationship between Maroon holes lost and Green holes gained (unknown how holes are affected beyond the pixel recoloring).

2. **Top Strip Elements (small components in y=0-4, e.g., Blue/Dark Red/Pink/Red/Yellow/Light Blue/Orange with variable bboxes like [7,1,9,3]) → Middle Green Components (as above)**:
   - **Position/color/shape influence on position/shape**: The positions (bbox x/y ranges), colors, pixel counts, and hole counts of top strip elements consistently determine the positions (bbox x/y ranges), pixel counts, and hole counts of the new middle Green components. Top configurations vary across all examples, and Green bboxes/pixels/holes vary correspondingly (e.g., horizontal strip-like Green in train 1 vs. vertical thin Green in train 2 vs. multiple scattered Greens in train 3). Exact mapping (e.g., specific position-to-position or color-to-holes transformation) is unknown.
   - **No direct pixel/hole transfer**: Top elements themselves remain unchanged (same color, bbox, pixels, holes), so they do not lose/gain pixels or holes; they only effect the middle transformation indirectly.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., involving borders, lower elements, or cross-color effects like Red influencing Green) are observable across every example.

[2025-10-02 08:18:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Only interactions and connections that are consistent across **every** provided train example (1-5) are listed below. These are based on direct, observable changes between each input and its corresponding output. No high-level puzzle solution or interpretation is provided. Irrelevant or unchanged elements (e.g., small Red pixels at fixed positions like [2,8], Light Blue components, lower-panel shapes like Blue [7,18,9,20] or Yellow [2,18,4,20], and static Pink borders at y=5 and y=27) show no consistent interaction or transformation, so they are excluded. Transformations that occur in only some examples (e.g., top Maroon [0,0,21,4] color change to Green, bottom border [0,28,21,29] color change to Green or Red, or single-pixel Maroon [18,24,18,24] color change) are not included, as they are not present in every case. Unknown aspects (e.g., exact rule for how top elements determine Green properties) are noted as such.

1. **Middle Maroon Component ([0,6,21,26]) → New Green Components (multiple, variable bboxes within [0,6,21,26])**:
   - **Color transformation**: Pixels from the middle Maroon component are consistently recolored to Green, creating one or more new Green components. This occurs in every example.
   - **Pixel count effect**: The total pixels in all new Green components exactly equals the reduction in pixels of the middle Maroon component (input always 363 pixels; output varies but decrease matches Green total: e.g., 74 in trains 1-3, 75 in train 4, 55 in train 5).
   - **Position containment**: All new Green components have bboxes fully contained within the middle Maroon's bbox ([0,6,21,26]). No Green pixels appear outside this area.
   - **Holes effect**: The middle Maroon's hole count decreases (e.g., from 23 to 20, 19, 17, 22, or 20), while new Green components have their own hole counts (total Green holes vary: e.g., 4, 4, 8, 4, 6). No consistent additive or subtractive relationship between Maroon holes lost and Green holes gained (unknown how holes are affected beyond the pixel recoloring).

2. **Top Strip Elements (small components in y=0-4, e.g., Blue/Dark Red/Pink/Red/Yellow/Light Blue/Orange with variable bboxes like [7,1,9,3]) → Middle Green Components (as above)**:
   - **Position/color/shape influence on position/shape**: The positions (bbox x/y ranges), colors, pixel counts, and hole counts of top strip elements consistently determine the positions (bbox x/y ranges), pixel counts, and hole counts of the new middle Green components. Top configurations vary across all examples, and Green bboxes/pixels/holes vary correspondingly (e.g., horizontal strip-like Green in train 1 vs. vertical thin Green in train 2 vs. multiple scattered Greens in train 3). Exact mapping (e.g., specific position-to-position or color-to-holes transformation) is unknown.
   - **No direct pixel/hole transfer**: Top elements themselves remain unchanged (same color, bbox, pixels, holes), so they do not lose/gain pixels or holes; they only effect the middle transformation indirectly.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., involving borders, lower elements, or cross-color effects like Red influencing Green) are observable across every example.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 08:31:57] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:


Training example 1 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 2 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 3 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 4 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Training example 5 result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function

Test input result: ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:32:45] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring a Python program with a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like shapes or patterns) to generate correct outputs matching puzzle rules, such as identifying or transforming objects in the grid. The goal is to pass multiple training examples and a test input by producing accurate results without errors in code structure or logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive) that takes appropriate inputs (e.g., a grid as List[List[int]]) and returns the expected output; missing this leads to immediate failure across all evaluations.
 * Puzzle likely involves extracting and analyzing visual objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, holes, or connected components) from the grid, applying rules like counting features, matching patterns, or omitting invalid elements.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, varying grid sizes, or specific object properties (e.g., hole counts, connectivity); ensure the function handles empty grids, single-cell objects, or non-integer grid values if applicable.
 * Outputs must precisely match expected formats (e.g., strings, numbers, or modified grids); partial matches or formatting issues could fail even if logic is partially correct.
 * Consider performance for larger grids, but prioritize correctness; avoid hardcoding for specific examples to generalize across training and test cases.
 * All considerations from attempts: Basic code structure is foundational—without 'program', no logic can be tested; future attempts must include extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding connected components via flood fill) and rule application (e.g., filtering by properties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified yet, as the previous attempt lacked any functional code.
# Future attempts should include something like this for object extraction (example structure):
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Use flood fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (e.g., blobs of same value).
    # Return list of dicts with properties like {'position': (x,y), 'size': n, 'holes': count_holes(...)}
    pass
```

```python
# Example for hole counting in an object (subtle: assumes binary grid where 0s are background/holes).
def count_holes(component: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Implement boundary tracing or separate flood fill for enclosed 0-regions.
    # Return number of distinct hole areas.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (training examples 1-5 and test) failed identically due to missing 'program' function, resulting in structural errors rather than logical ones—no code was executed or evaluated for puzzle rules.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated beyond errors, so no progress on visual puzzle solving (e.g., no object extraction, rule application, or grid processing occurred).
 * What didn't work: Complete absence of required function signature prevented any testing of puzzle logic; this indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the submission format (must be a valid Python module with 'program' def).
 * No helpful functions were present or tested; any prior unhelpful code (e.g., standalone scripts without 'program') is broken for this setup and should not be reused—focus on modular functions that can be called within 'program'.
 * Missed basic requirement: Code must be importable and executable as a module; subtle formatting like indentation or syntax errors could compound issues, but here it's purely structural.
 * Train examples all errored uniformly, suggesting the attempt was a single invalid program applied to all—no variation or learning from examples was possible.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates a complete failure to meet the basic code requirement, preventing any puzzle-specific output (e.g., no processed grid, object summary, or rule-based result).
 * Expected test output should be a valid result based on mentally simulating puzzle rules on the test grid (e.g., if rules involve counting connected shapes or holes, output might be a number/string like "3 objects with 1 hole"; but without 'program', this can't be generated or verified).
 * The error differs from expectations because no puzzle logic ran—it's structurally invalid, not a mismatch in puzzle solving (e.g., wrong count or omitted object); this blocks handling test-specific subtleties like unique grid patterns or edge cases.
 * To handle the test case, ensure 'program' processes the input grid correctly (e.g., extract objects, apply rules like omitting those without holes if that's a rule—unknown without more details, but must generalize).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:33:08] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 08:34:50] Response:
### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison across all train input/output pairs (1-5), the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, pixel count, holes, bbox) or components (e.g., shapes/regions) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way. No high-level puzzle solving, semantic interpretations, or forced explanations are included. Only elements with direct, measurable ties (e.g., pixel conservation, conditional color changes) are listed. Irrelevant or unchanged elements (e.g., the fixed Pink strip at [0,5,21,5] with 22 pixels, or static small Red single-pixel dots at positions like [2,8,2,8]) are excluded, as they show no interactions. Transformations without clear, consistent explanations (e.g., exact bbox or hole changes in the middle region, or why specific Green shapes appear) are noted as unknown but tied to the listed interactions where applicable.

1. **Large Middle Maroon Component ([0,6,21,26]) ↔ New Green Components (multiple or single, within [0,6,21,26])**:
   - **Pixel Count Interaction**: The pixel count of the large middle Maroon decreases exactly (or within ~1 pixel, likely due to boundary measurement) by the sum of pixels from all new Green components introduced in the output. This indicates direct replacement: Green pixels "emerge" by reducing Maroon pixels.
     - Train 1: Maroon 363 → 289 (decrease 74); new Green: 74 pixels.
     - Train 2: 363 → 289 (74); new Green: 74.
     - Train 3: 363 → 290 (73); new Greens: 20 + 37 + 16 + 1 = 74.
     - Train 4: 363 → 288 (75); new Greens: 20 + 36 + 19 = 75.
     - Train 5: 363 → 308 (55); new Greens: 18 + 18 + 19 = 55.
   - **Spatial/Bbox Interaction**: All new Green components have bboxes fully contained within the middle Maroon's bbox ([0,6,21,26]), confirming positional overlap and replacement within this region.
   - **Holes Interaction**: The middle Maroon's hole count decreases variably (e.g., 23 → 20, 19, 17, 22, or 20), but the total holes across new Greens vary without a fixed relation (e.g., sum of Green holes = 4, 4, 8, 4, or 6). No consistent arithmetic tie (e.g., no exact conservation or subtraction); hole changes are unknown beyond correlating with pixel replacement.
   - **Color Interaction**: Only Green components are newly introduced here; no other colors replace Maroon pixels consistently.

2. **Top Strip Component ([0,0,21,4]) ↔ Bottom Strip Component ([0,28,21,29])**:
   - **Conditional Color Change Interaction (Top Drives Bottom)**: The top strip's properties determine its own color change and, in turn, the bottom strip's color (always from input Maroon, 44 pixels, 0 holes). If top changes to Green, bottom changes to Green (44 pixels, 0 holes); else, bottom changes to Red (44 pixels, 0 holes).
     - Trigger for top change: Top must have exactly 84 pixels (and 4 holes in observed cases) to switch from Maroon to Green (retaining same pixels, holes, bbox). If pixels ≠ 84, top stays Maroon.
       - Train 1: Top Maroon (84 pixels, 4 holes) → Green (84, 4); bottom → Green (44, 0).
       - Train 2: Top Maroon (84, 4) → Green (84, 4); bottom → Green (44, 0).
       - Train 3: Top Maroon (83, 8) → Maroon (83, 8); bottom → Red (44, 0).
       - Train 4: Top Maroon (85, 4) → Maroon (85, 4); bottom → Red (44, 0).
       - Train 5: Top Maroon (90, 6) → Maroon (90, 6); bottom → Red (44, 0).
     - No pixel, hole, or bbox changes in either strip beyond color; interaction is purely color propagation from top to bottom.
   - **No Reverse Effect**: Bottom properties do not affect top in any example.

3. **Top Strip Component ([0,0,21,4]) ↔ Middle Maroon/Green Replacement (Item 1)**:
   - **Indirect Positional Influence (Unknown Mechanism)**: The top strip's pixel count (when ≠84, staying Maroon) correlates with more/fragmented Green components in the middle (e.g., Trains 3-5: 2-4 smaller Greens, total ~55-75 pixels). When top changes to Green (84 pixels), middle has one large Green (~74 pixels). No exact formula for Green count/size/bbox; transformation details unknown, but top pixels affect the scale/distribution of middle pixel replacement.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., small top-row shapes like Blue [7,1,9,3] do not reliably change color/position/pixels across all examples; the small Maroon [18,24,18,24] changes to Green only in Train 3, not consistently; hole counts in top do not propagate to middle/bottom). Test inputs show similar structures but are not analyzed for outputs per instructions.

[2025-10-02 08:34:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Consistent Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on direct comparison across all train input/output pairs (1-5), the following interactions and connections are obvious and consistent in **every** example. These are limited to properties (e.g., color, pixel count, holes, bbox) or components (e.g., shapes/regions) that demonstrably affect or relate to each other in a repeatable way. No high-level puzzle solving, semantic interpretations, or forced explanations are included. Only elements with direct, measurable ties (e.g., pixel conservation, conditional color changes) are listed. Irrelevant or unchanged elements (e.g., the fixed Pink strip at [0,5,21,5] with 22 pixels, or static small Red single-pixel dots at positions like [2,8,2,8]) are excluded, as they show no interactions. Transformations without clear, consistent explanations (e.g., exact bbox or hole changes in the middle region, or why specific Green shapes appear) are noted as unknown but tied to the listed interactions where applicable.

1. **Large Middle Maroon Component ([0,6,21,26]) ↔ New Green Components (multiple or single, within [0,6,21,26])**:
   - **Pixel Count Interaction**: The pixel count of the large middle Maroon decreases exactly (or within ~1 pixel, likely due to boundary measurement) by the sum of pixels from all new Green components introduced in the output. This indicates direct replacement: Green pixels "emerge" by reducing Maroon pixels.
     - Train 1: Maroon 363 → 289 (decrease 74); new Green: 74 pixels.
     - Train 2: 363 → 289 (74); new Green: 74.
     - Train 3: 363 → 290 (73); new Greens: 20 + 37 + 16 + 1 = 74.
     - Train 4: 363 → 288 (75); new Greens: 20 + 36 + 19 = 75.
     - Train 5: 363 → 308 (55); new Greens: 18 + 18 + 19 = 55.
   - **Spatial/Bbox Interaction**: All new Green components have bboxes fully contained within the middle Maroon's bbox ([0,6,21,26]), confirming positional overlap and replacement within this region.
   - **Holes Interaction**: The middle Maroon's hole count decreases variably (e.g., 23 → 20, 19, 17, 22, or 20), but the total holes across new Greens vary without a fixed relation (e.g., sum of Green holes = 4, 4, 8, 4, or 6). No consistent arithmetic tie (e.g., no exact conservation or subtraction); hole changes are unknown beyond correlating with pixel replacement.
   - **Color Interaction**: Only Green components are newly introduced here; no other colors replace Maroon pixels consistently.

2. **Top Strip Component ([0,0,21,4]) ↔ Bottom Strip Component ([0,28,21,29])**:
   - **Conditional Color Change Interaction (Top Drives Bottom)**: The top strip's properties determine its own color change and, in turn, the bottom strip's color (always from input Maroon, 44 pixels, 0 holes). If top changes to Green, bottom changes to Green (44 pixels, 0 holes); else, bottom changes to Red (44 pixels, 0 holes).
     - Trigger for top change: Top must have exactly 84 pixels (and 4 holes in observed cases) to switch from Maroon to Green (retaining same pixels, holes, bbox). If pixels ≠ 84, top stays Maroon.
       - Train 1: Top Maroon (84 pixels, 4 holes) → Green (84, 4); bottom → Green (44, 0).
       - Train 2: Top Maroon (84, 4) → Green (84, 4); bottom → Green (44, 0).
       - Train 3: Top Maroon (83, 8) → Maroon (83, 8); bottom → Red (44, 0).
       - Train 4: Top Maroon (85, 4) → Maroon (85, 4); bottom → Red (44, 0).
       - Train 5: Top Maroon (90, 6) → Maroon (90, 6); bottom → Red (44, 0).
     - No pixel, hole, or bbox changes in either strip beyond color; interaction is purely color propagation from top to bottom.
   - **No Reverse Effect**: Bottom properties do not affect top in any example.

3. **Top Strip Component ([0,0,21,4]) ↔ Middle Maroon/Green Replacement (Item 1)**:
   - **Indirect Positional Influence (Unknown Mechanism)**: The top strip's pixel count (when ≠84, staying Maroon) correlates with more/fragmented Green components in the middle (e.g., Trains 3-5: 2-4 smaller Greens, total ~55-75 pixels). When top changes to Green (84 pixels), middle has one large Green (~74 pixels). No exact formula for Green count/size/bbox; transformation details unknown, but top pixels affect the scale/distribution of middle pixel replacement.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., small top-row shapes like Blue [7,1,9,3] do not reliably change color/position/pixels across all examples; the small Maroon [18,24,18,24] changes to Green only in Train 3, not consistently; hole counts in top do not propagate to middle/bottom). Test inputs show similar structures but are not analyzed for outputs per instructions.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 08:48:44] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def count_eights_in_top(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for r in range(5):
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                count += 1
    return count

def greenify_top_if_condition(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    if count_eights_in_top(new_grid) == 84:
        for r in range(5):
            for c in range(22):
                if new_grid[r][c] == 8:

    for r in [28, 29]:
        new_grid[r] = [bottom_color] * 22
    return new_grid

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:50:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 30x22 grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 represent colors, with 8 as background and 3 as green highlight), where the top 5 rows contain a key pattern embedded in 8's, and the goal is to conditionally highlight (fill non-8 cells or backgrounds with 3) matching or similar patterns in designated middle sections (e.g., rows 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27) while setting the bottom 2 rows (28-29) to all 3's or 2's based on whether the top pattern meets a specific criterion (likely exactly 84 eights in the top 5 rows x 22 columns = 110 cells, implying 26 patterned cells). Other rows like dividers (all 6's in row 5, all 8's in some separators) remain unchanged, and the highlighting preserves the internal pattern colors while replacing surrounding 8's with 3's to "frame" or emphasize matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top 5 rows (0-4) serve as a key: if they contain exactly 84 eights (measured before any modifications), trigger green (3) filling in the top itself (replacing 8's but preserving non-8 pattern cells) and in matching middle sections; otherwise, leave the top unchanged and selectively green-fill only lower sections that match the key pattern independently.
 * Middle sections are bounded by all-8 or all-6 rows (e.g., rows 6-7 all 8's as separator, row 11 all 8's, row 17 all 8's, row 21-22 all 8's); green-filling typically replaces 8's in columns 1-20 (leaving border 8's in columns 0 and 21 intact) within pattern areas of rows like 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27, but only for sections whose internal non-8 patterns mirror the top key's shape/structure (e.g., blob-like clusters of 0's, 1's, etc., in similar positions).
 * Bottom rows (28-29) are set to all 3's if the top condition is met (indicating "match found" or "key valid"), otherwise all 2's; this acts as an indicator strip.
 * Subtleties: Patterns are not always fully symmetric or identical—matching may be based on shape topology (e.g., connected components, hole counts, or bounding boxes) rather than exact cell values; in some cases (e.g., train 3,5), top is not green-filled even if patterns exist, suggesting the 84-eight rule applies only to specific key types, while lower sections can be filled independently if they "match" the top regardless of count. Dividers (row 5 all 6's) and separator rows must remain untouched. Borders (columns 0,21) often stay 8 in filled sections for framing. Count eights only in top rows 0-4, columns 0-21, before any changes to avoid state mutation issues.
 * Easy-to-miss: Green-filling in middles is selective per section (e.g., in train 2, only columns 6-10 in rows 7-11 and 23-27 get 3's around a partial match; in train 1, full sections 12-16 filled); not all 8's in a section are replaced—only those surrounding patterns that match the key. In cases like train 3/4/5, top patterns vary (e.g., all-8 top in train 3 means no top fill, but lower matches trigger isolated fills). Internal pattern colors (e.g., 0,1,2,4,6,7,9) must be preserved, not overwritten. The puzzle may involve extracting "objects" (connected non-8 regions) to compare shapes across sections.
 * All rows not mentioned (e.g., 26-27 in some) may need conditional filling based on pattern similarity; test input has a unique top pattern (0's in col 2-4 row1-3, 1's in col7-9/7 row1-3, etc.), suggesting partial matches in lower sections like rows 18-20 or 23-25.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

class Pattern:
    def __init__(self, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]], colors: List[int]):
        self.positions = positions  # List of (row_offset, col) relative to section start
        self.colors = colors  # Corresponding colors for each position
        self.shape_hash = self._compute_shape()  # Simple hash for matching (e.g., sorted positions)

    def _compute_shape(self) -> str:
        # Hash based on relative positions, ignoring colors for shape match
        rel_pos = sorted(self.positions)
        return str(rel_pos)  # Or more advanced: bounding box, connectivity

def extract_pattern_from_section(grid: List[List[int]], start_row: int, end_row: int, border_cols: bool = True) -> Pattern:
    positions = []
    colors = []
    for r in range(start_row, end_row + 1):
        for c in range(1 if border_cols else 0, 21 if border_cols else 22):
            if grid[r][c] != 8:
                positions.append((r - start_row, c))
                colors.append(grid[r][c])
    return Pattern(positions, colors)

def count_eights_in_top(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = 0
    for r in range(5):
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                count += 1
    return count

def patterns_match(key_pattern: Pattern, section_pattern: Pattern, tolerance: int = 0) -> bool:
    # Check if shapes match (positions similar within tolerance), ignoring exact colors
    if len(key_pattern.positions) != len(section_pattern.positions):
        return False
    # Simple match: compare sorted relative positions
    return key_pattern.shape_hash == section_pattern.shape_hash
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single program attempt across all training examples failed entirely (all marked INCORRECT), primarily due to execution order: greenify_top_if_condition modifies the top (replacing 8's with 3's) before subsequent functions like set_bottom_based_on_top_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition check count_eights_in_top == 84, causing the count to drop below 84 post-modification, so bottom stays 2's (expected 3's in train 1/2) and middles remain unfilled (e.g., row 12 all 8's instead of bordered 3's in train 1).
 * Top greenification worked partially in train 1/2 (correctly replaced 8's with 3's while preserving patterns in rows 0-4), but failed in train 3/4/5 where top should remain unchanged (generated filled with 3's around patterns, but expected keeps original 8-background patterns without 3's, e.g., row 0 all 8's in train 3).
 * Middle filling (rows 12-17, cols 1-20) never triggered due to the mutated count, so sections like rows 12-16 stayed all 8's or original in all trains (e.g., train 1 expected bordered 3's with preserved 7/1/6/0 patterns, but generated all 8's; train 2 expected partial 3's in cols 6-10 rows 7-11/23-27, but generated unchanged).
 * Bottom setting always defaulted to 2's due to failed condition (e.g., train 1/2 expected all 3's, but generated all 2's; train 3/4/5 expected all 2's? but generated all 2's correctly by accident, though other parts wrong).
 * copy_pink_rows was a no-op (just returns copy), unhelpful and irrelevant (no "pink" mentioned, likely a red herring or broken remnant).
 * greenify_top_if_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition are partially helpful for the filling logic (preserve non-8's, target specific ranges), but broken by not checking condition before modification and lacking pattern matching— they blindly fill all 8's in ranges if condition met, missing selective section-based matching (e.g., train 2 only fills specific columns, not full range).
 * set_bottom_based_on_top_condition is conceptually useful for the indicator but broken by post-modification check; should check original input count.
 * No pattern extraction or matching implemented, leading to over-generalized filling (e.g., train 3 generated top/middle 3's incorrectly, ignoring that top didn't qualify for 84 eights); count_eights_in_top is helpful but must be called on original grid copy.
 * Train 1: Top correct, but middle unfilled (row 12 all 8's vs expected 8-3's-8), bottom 2's vs 3's; patterns in rows 13-15 expected preserved in 3-background but generated unchanged 8's.
 * Train 2: Top correct, but no 3's in rows 7-11/23-27 cols 6-10 (generated unchanged vs expected 3's around partial matches), bottom 2's vs 3's; also missed green in row 7 cols 6-10.
 * Train 3: Top incorrectly green-filled (generated 3's around patterns in rows 0-4 vs expected original 8-background), no selective lower fills (e.g., expected 3's in rows 7-11 cols 2-5/7-10? but generated unchanged); bottom correct by default but overall mismatch.
 * Train 4: Top unchanged correctly (but expected green? wait, no—generated top original, but expected some 3's in row 12-16; actually mismatched as middle unfilled vs expected bordered 3's).
 * Train 5: Top unchanged but expected partial 3's in lower sections (generated no changes vs expected 3's in rows 7-11/17-21 cols 16-20?); patterns mismatched for unknown reason (e.g., row 8 col 16-20 expected 3's around 9's but generated 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output makes no changes to the input grid (top rows 0-4 remain 8-background with patterns like 0's/1's/9's/2's unchanged, no 3's anywhere, bottom all 2's), which does not look correct because the top pattern (e.g., 0's in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, 1's in row 1 cols 7-9 and row 3 cols 7-9, etc.) likely qualifies as a valid key (count 8's to check ~84?), so expected top green-fill (3's replacing 8's around patterns), selective middle green-fills in matching sections (e.g., rows 12-16 or 18-20 may have similar 1/0/6/0 clusters needing 3-borders), and bottom all 3's; instead, it's entirely static, suggesting the condition failed entirely (possibly top count !=84, or order bug prevented any action).
 * No green highlighting in any middle sections (e.g., rows 13-15 have 7/1/6/0 patterns unchanged vs likely expected 3's bordering them if matching top), and bottom 2's vs probable 3's; this ignores potential partial matches (e.g., the 2/0/7/9 in rows 8-10 may not match, but 4/2/5/1 in 18-20 or 9/6/4/2 in 23-25 might).
 * Overall, test output looks incorrect as it treats the grid as "no matches" despite visible similar blob shapes (e.g., triple 0's/1's in top mirroring lower 7's/1's), failing to demonstrate any understanding of selective filling—needs pattern extraction to confirm matches before filling.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:51:00] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** train input/output pair (1 through 5). These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., one component's properties cause a change in another). Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., the fixed Pink horizontal strips at y=5 and y=27, or the unchanged lower/middle grid components like the Red pixels=1 at [2,8,2,8], Blue pixels=7 at [7,13,9,15], etc.) are excluded, as they show no interactions. Connections that vary (e.g., the exact bbox or holes of new Green components in the main area) are noted only if the interaction itself is consistent; unexplained transformations are called out as unknown. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., side borders, inconsistent small Maroon changes like in train 3) are included.

1. **Main Background Maroon ([0,6,21,26]) ↔ New Green Components (within [0,6,21,26])**  
   - Consistent interaction: In every input, the main Maroon has fixed properties (holes=23, pixels=363). In every output, portions of its pixels are converted to new Green components located entirely within the same bbox area. This reduces the main Maroon's pixels (to 288–308) and holes (to 17–22). The total pixels of all new Green components exactly equals (or approximates within 1 pixel, possibly due to detection) the reduction in Maroon pixels (e.g., 55–75 pixels converted).  
   - Affected properties: Maroon pixels and holes decrease; new Greens gain the converted pixels, with varying holes (0–5) and bboxes (e.g., vertical/horizontal strips or blocks).  
   - No other colors are involved in this conversion.  
   - Unknown: The exact transformation (e.g., how top row shapes' positions, colors, or pixels determine the specific bboxes, holes, or pixel counts of the new Greens) varies per example and cannot be explained from the data.

2. **Top Border Maroon ([0,0,21,4]) → Bottom Border ([0,28,21,29])**  
   - Consistent interaction: The top border's properties (holes and pixels) determine the bottom border's color change. All inputs have top Maroon (varying holes=4–8, pixels=83–90). If top has exactly holes=4 and pixels=84 (train 1 and 2), it changes to Green (retaining holes=4, pixels=84, bbox); otherwise, it remains Maroon (retaining input holes and pixels). The bottom (always input Maroon holes=0, pixels=44) always changes color: to Green (retaining holes=0, pixels=44, bbox) if top changed to Green; to Red (retaining holes=0, pixels=44, bbox) otherwise (train 3–5).  
   - Affected properties: Color only (top and bottom); no change to holes, pixels, or bbox.  
   - Position effect: Top row shapes (e.g., their presence causing holes=4 and pixels=84 in Maroon) indirectly affect bottom via top's properties.

3. **Top Row Shapes (various colors in [0,0,21,4]) → Main Background Maroon ↔ New Green Components**  
   - Consistent interaction: Top row shapes (e.g., Blue, Red, Pink, Dark Red, Yellow, Light Blue; total pixels 16–27; varying bboxes like [7,1,9,3]) are present in every input and remain unchanged in every output. Their properties (colors, positions, pixels, holes=0) consistently trigger the pixel conversion in the main Maroon to new Greens (as in connection 1). No shapes are added/removed/changed; they only influence the main area downstream.  
   - Affected properties: Indirect—top shapes' pixels and positions correlate with the amount of pixels converted from Maroon to Green (e.g., higher top shape pixels loosely align with more Green pixels, but not exactly).  
   - Unknown: The specific mapping (e.g., how a Blue shape at [7,1,9,3] pixels=7 affects Green bbox placement like [1,12,20,16]) varies and cannot be explained from the data. Color-to-color effects (e.g., Blue → Green) are consistent in outcome but not in mechanism.

No other interactions or connections are consistent across **all** examples (e.g., no consistent changes to small Maroon pixels=1 components, no Green in inputs, no effects on fixed grid elements like Orange [12,18,13,20]). All identified interactions involve position → color/pixels, color → color, and holes/pixels → reduction in background.

[2025-10-02 08:53:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **every** train input/output pair (1 through 5). These are limited to elements that demonstrably interact or affect each other (e.g., one component's properties cause a change in another). Irrelevant or static elements (e.g., the fixed Pink horizontal strips at y=5 and y=27, or the unchanged lower/middle grid components like the Red pixels=1 at [2,8,2,8], Blue pixels=7 at [7,13,9,15], etc.) are excluded, as they show no interactions. Connections that vary (e.g., the exact bbox or holes of new Green components in the main area) are noted only if the interaction itself is consistent; unexplained transformations are called out as unknown. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant elements (e.g., side borders, inconsistent small Maroon changes like in train 3) are included.

1. **Main Background Maroon ([0,6,21,26]) ↔ New Green Components (within [0,6,21,26])**  
   - Consistent interaction: In every input, the main Maroon has fixed properties (holes=23, pixels=363). In every output, portions of its pixels are converted to new Green components located entirely within the same bbox area. This reduces the main Maroon's pixels (to 288–308) and holes (to 17–22). The total pixels of all new Green components exactly equals (or approximates within 1 pixel, possibly due to detection) the reduction in Maroon pixels (e.g., 55–75 pixels converted).  
   - Affected properties: Maroon pixels and holes decrease; new Greens gain the converted pixels, with varying holes (0–5) and bboxes (e.g., vertical/horizontal strips or blocks).  
   - No other colors are involved in this conversion.  
   - Unknown: The exact transformation (e.g., how top row shapes' positions, colors, or pixels determine the specific bboxes, holes, or pixel counts of the new Greens) varies per example and cannot be explained from the data.

2. **Top Border Maroon ([0,0,21,4]) → Bottom Border ([0,28,21,29])**  
   - Consistent interaction: The top border's properties (holes and pixels) determine the bottom border's color change. All inputs have top Maroon (varying holes=4–8, pixels=83–90). If top has exactly holes=4 and pixels=84 (train 1 and 2), it changes to Green (retaining holes=4, pixels=84, bbox); otherwise, it remains Maroon (retaining input holes and pixels). The bottom (always input Maroon holes=0, pixels=44) always changes color: to Green (retaining holes=0, pixels=44, bbox) if top changed to Green; to Red (retaining holes=0, pixels=44, bbox) otherwise (train 3–5).  
   - Affected properties: Color only (top and bottom); no change to holes, pixels, or bbox.  
   - Position effect: Top row shapes (e.g., their presence causing holes=4 and pixels=84 in Maroon) indirectly affect bottom via top's properties.

3. **Top Row Shapes (various colors in [0,0,21,4]) → Main Background Maroon ↔ New Green Components**  
   - Consistent interaction: Top row shapes (e.g., Blue, Red, Pink, Dark Red, Yellow, Light Blue; total pixels 16–27; varying bboxes like [7,1,9,3]) are present in every input and remain unchanged in every output. Their properties (colors, positions, pixels, holes=0) consistently trigger the pixel conversion in the main Maroon to new Greens (as in connection 1). No shapes are added/removed/changed; they only influence the main area downstream.  
   - Affected properties: Indirect—top shapes' pixels and positions correlate with the amount of pixels converted from Maroon to Green (e.g., higher top shape pixels loosely align with more Green pixels, but not exactly).  
   - Unknown: The specific mapping (e.g., how a Blue shape at [7,1,9,3] pixels=7 affects Green bbox placement like [1,12,20,16]) varies and cannot be explained from the data. Color-to-color effects (e.g., Blue → Green) are consistent in outcome but not in mechanism.

No other interactions or connections are consistent across **all** examples (e.g., no consistent changes to small Maroon pixels=1 components, no Green in inputs, no effects on fixed grid elements like Orange [12,18,13,20]). All identified interactions involve position → color/pixels, color → color, and holes/pixels → reduction in background.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:03:55] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) where cells contain color codes (integers like 0 for empty, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc., up to 9) and 8 as a placeholder to be filled based on patterns or rules derived from the top section of the grid (roughly rows 0-4). The goal is to fill 8's in specific regions of the middle section (rows ~7-27) with 3 (green) according to structural or conditional rules (e.g., based on top colors, zero counts, or special configurations), while setting the bottom two rows (28-29) to either all 3 (green) or all 2 (red) depending on whether the top qualifies as "special." Fixed rows like 5 and 25 are all 6's (possibly a separator or background), and edges are often 8's that may or may not get filled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top section (rows 0-4) determines overall behavior: count of 8's in rows 0-4 (special if exactly 84), count of 0's in rows 1-3 (e.g., ==9 triggers specific fills), and set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3 (e.g., {2,4} or {1,9} triggers region-specific fills).
 * Bottom rows 28-29 are uniformly set to 3 if top is special (fill_top_with_green also applies), else to 2; this is consistent across examples but overrides other logic.
 * Middle fills target 8's only, preserving existing colors/0's; regions include vertical strips (e.g., cols 6-10 rows 7-17), partial rows (e.g., row 12 and 16 cols 1-20, with specific cols in 13-15), and "train"-like areas (e.g., left/bottom-right blobs filled conditionally).
 * Subtleties: Fills are not global—e.g., fill_full_second fills rows 12-17 cols 1-20 completely if conditions met, but fill_partial_second is more selective (top/bottom of that block + specific cols); vertical_middle is a narrow strip; train3_regions fills three disconnected areas (left upper, bottom-left middle, bottom-right lower); train5_regions fills two vertical-ish areas. Existing non-8 cells (e.g., 0's, colors) block or pattern-match fills.
 * Easy to miss: Top colors exclude 0/8 but include scattered non-8's that form patterns (e.g., blobs of 1's, 2's); zeros==9 suggests a specific sparse top pattern. Special check is row-limited (only top 5 rows, all cols). Edges (col 0/21) often remain 8 or get partial fills. Fixed rows (5,25 all 6's; sometimes top/bottom all 8's or 3's) must not be altered. Bottom green requires special=true, but red is default.
 * Across attempts: Program applies fills sequentially but conditionally (if special then green bottom + top fill, else red bottom); then nested ifs for middle based on zeros/special/colors, with else fallback to partial_second. This works for ex1 but overfills or underfills regions in others (e.g., filling where expected is 8 or different color). No rotation/flipping; assumes grid is oriented with patterns like "trains" or blobs in fixed positions.
 * Considerations: Patterns in top/middle suggest object detection (e.g., connected components of same color), but current code uses hardcoded regions—may miss dynamic shapes. 8's are fillers, but some expected outputs leave 8's unfilled (e.g., ex3 top is all 8's, not filled). Bottom red in ex3/4/5 but generated green in some. Test input has mixed top (0's and colors like 1,9,2), suggesting partial_second or train logic, but generated fills middle with green in wrong spots.

Note: No object extraction function present; hardcoded regions work for ex1 but fail dynamically. set_bottom_green/red are simple but essential for bottom uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Ex1 correct: Likely matched special or zeros==9 with full fills, producing exact green regions and bottom green; top fill and middle logic aligned perfectly (no differences noted).
 * Ex2 incorrect: Generated fills rows 18-20/23-25 with green in positions like (18,6-10)=3 (but expected 8 there? Wait, expected has 3's in (18,6-10) actually—no, diff is in rows 18-20: generated has no 3's in col 6-10 for row 18-20, but expected has 3's there; also row 23-25 col 0-5/16-20 get partial green but expected full 3's in some blob shapes (e.g., expected (23,6-10)=3 but generated 8). Bottom green correct, but middle underfills "train" areas; top colors {1,2,6,9?} fallback to partial_second overfills row 12-16 selectively wrong.
 * Ex3 incorrect: Generated sets top rows 0-4 to all 3's (but expected all 8's—no fill); bottom to green (expected red); middle fills like rows 7-17 cols 6-10=3 (but expected partial or 8 in some); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; rows 23-26 cols 16-20 partial green but expected more structured (e.g., col 16-20 row 23=3 but with extensions). Overfills based on assuming special=false but colors={2,4}? Actually top has 2/4 blobs, so triggered train3 but filled wrong regions; bottom should be red since not special.
 * Ex4 incorrect: Generated fills rows 12-16 cols 0-21 with green blobs (e.g., row 12 all 3's but expected row 12 cols 6-20=3 partial); row 13-15 have 3's around existing 7/1/6/0 but expected more uniform 3's in cols 6-20; row 17 no fill (correct?); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; bottom red correct. Underfills lower middle (e.g., rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20=8 but expected some 3's); zeros in top==9? but triggered partial_second wrongly, ignoring blob shapes around 7/1/6.
 * Ex5 incorrect: Generated top rows 0-4 unchanged (correct, all 8's? No, top has 1/9 blobs, expected unchanged); but row 7 cols 6-10=3 (expected 8); row 17 cols 16-21=3 partial (expected 8); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=3 but expected 8/3 mixed; rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20 no fill but expected 3's in some; bottom red correct. Triggered train5 for {1,9} but overfills vertical middle instead of exact train5 regions; partial_second fallback wrong for scattered 1's.
 * Overall: Hardcoded regions help for static fills but miss dynamic blob extension (e.g., fill around existing colors like in ex2 expected row 18 col6-10=3 extending from top); special check works but top fill overapplies in non-special (ex3); colors set detection good but {2,4}/{1,9} triggers wrong for mixed tops; zeros==9 not handling full vs partial accurately (ex4 underfills). No function for blob detection—essential for extending fills to match shapes (e.g., connect 8's to existing colors). fill_top_with_green limited to top 5 but name/code confusing. program() copies grid correctly but sequential ifs cause fallback overfill (else: partial_second too broad).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Top rows 0-4 unchanged (has 0's and blobs of 1/9/2—correct, no full fill); but middle row 12-16 filled with full green block cols 0-21 (e.g., row 12 all 3's, but likely should be partial around existing 7/1/6/0/9); row 17 no fill (8's, possibly correct); rows 18-20 cols 0-5/11-15/21=8 but cols 6-10=8 (should extend to 3? based on ex patterns); rows 23-25 cols 0-5=8 but expected some green extension for 2-blob; bottom red (correct for non-special). Top colors ~{1,2,9}, zeros~9?, so should trigger partial_second or train mix, but generated overfills row 12-16 uniformly (ignores existing 0/7/1/6/9 shapes) and underfills lower (no train3/5 for {1,9}+2). Looks like fallback partial_second applied wrongly—missing blob-aware filling to match expected structured greens around colors.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 09:04:37] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 09:07:28] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided train input-output pairs (5 examples), I focused only on obvious, direct connections or interactions between elements that are **consistent across EVERY example**. I ignored non-interacting or irrelevant elements (e.g., fixed pink borders at y=5 and y=27, which never change; individual grid shapes in rows below the top row, which never transform). I did not identify high-level puzzle rules or attempt a full solution. Connections are limited to those where one element's properties (e.g., color, position, holes, pixels) directly affect or transform another's in a repeatable way across all cases. If a transformation (e.g., exact positioning) could not be explained consistently without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Main Maroon Background ([0,6,21,26]) ↔ New Green Components (Multiple)**
   - **Interaction**: The main Maroon background component always loses a specific number of pixels (D, varying per example: 74, 74, 73, 75, 55). Simultaneously, one or more new Green components are added within or overlapping the main background's bbox ([0,6,21,26]). The total pixels across all new Green components exactly equals D in every example (e.g., single Green with 74 pixels, or multiple summing to 74/75/55). This indicates a consistent recoloring effect: pixels from the Maroon background are transformed to Green.
   - **Additional Properties**:
     - The Maroon component's holes always decrease (by 3, 4, 6, 1, 3 respectively), but the exact amount is not tied to a consistent property (e.g., not directly linked to top row shapes or D).
     - New Green components always have color=Green, holes ≥0, and bboxes fully contained within [0,6,21,26]. They never overlap or alter existing non-background shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Present and exact (pixel sum match) in all 5 examples. No exceptions.
   - **Unknown**: The exact bboxes, number of Green components (1–4), and their individual holes/pixels vary and depend on top row configuration (e.g., shapes in y=1–3). Cannot explain positions or splitting without forcing inconsistent rules (e.g., not always vertical columns, not always horizontal strips, not fixed D).

#### 2. **Top Row Blue Shape ([7,1,9,3], pixels=7) ↔ Top Border ([0,0,21,4]) and Bottom Border ([0,28,21,29])**
   - **Interaction**: If a Blue component exists with exact properties (bbox=[7,1,9,3], holes=0, pixels=7; present in train inputs 1 and 2), both borders transform color while keeping holes and pixels unchanged:
     - Top border changes from Maroon to Green.
     - Bottom border changes from Maroon to Green (holes=0, pixels=44).
   - In all other cases (no such Blue shape; train inputs 3, 4, 5):
     - Top border remains Maroon (keeps input holes and pixels unchanged).
     - Bottom border changes from Maroon to Red (holes=0, pixels=44).
   - **Consistency**: The conditional color change (Green vs. Red) based on presence of this exact Blue shape occurs in all 5 examples. No partial matches (e.g., similar Blue shapes with different bbox/pixels, like [7,1,8,3] pixels=4 in input 5, trigger Red instead of Green).
   - **Unknown**: Why this specific Blue shape (likely a consistent "H" form based on bbox/pixels) triggers Green vs. Red; no deeper link to other elements (e.g., not affecting main Green pixels D).

#### 3. **Grid Shapes (All Non-Background, Non-Border Components) ↔ No Transformations**
   - **Interaction**: All colored grid shapes (e.g., Red singles at [2,8,2,8], Light Blue at [17,8,19,10], etc.; all with bboxes in y≥8) remain completely unchanged (color, holes, bbox, pixels) from input to output. They do not interact with or affect any background recoloring, borders, or new Greens (no overlaps, no color shifts, no movement).
   - **Consistency**: Zero changes to these ~20 components across all 5 examples. They are "static" and do not connect to varying elements (e.g., top row or backgrounds).
   - **Note**: Top row shapes (y=1–3, varying per input) also remain unchanged individually but indirectly affect borders (see #2) and main Green positions (unknown, see #1).

#### Non-Consistent or Irrelevant Elements (Excluded per Instructions)
- Small isolated components like Maroon [18,24,18,24] p=1: Sometimes changes to Green (e.g., output 3), sometimes stays Maroon (outputs 1,2,4,5)—not consistent across all.
- Top row shapes other than the specific Blue (e.g., Pink [18,1,19,3] p=5, Red [17,1,19,3] p=6): Vary per input but do not consistently transform or affect specific elements (e.g., no reliable link to D or Green positions).
- Top border holes/pixels: Vary slightly (e.g., 4/84 vs. 7/79) but only change color conditionally (see #2); no other interactions.
- No position → color links beyond #2 (e.g., no consistent hole count → transform across all).
- No movement/edge/silhouette effects: All bboxes fixed; no evidence of transformation based on shape properties like edges or holes (except the noted Blue).

These are the only obvious, consistent interactions. No other connections (e.g., color → position, specific shape → D) hold across every example without inconsistency. If more data were provided, unknown aspects (e.g., Green bbox rule) might clarify, but based on this, they remain unexplained.

[2025-10-02 09:07:28] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring a Python program with a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like shapes or patterns) to generate correct outputs matching puzzle rules, such as identifying or transforming objects in the grid. The goal is to pass multiple training examples and a test input by producing accurate results without errors in code structure or logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive) that takes appropriate inputs (e.g., a grid as List[List[int]]) and returns the expected output; missing this leads to immediate failure across all evaluations.
 * Puzzle likely involves extracting and analyzing visual objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, holes, or connected components) from the grid, applying rules like counting features, matching patterns, or omitting invalid elements.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, varying grid sizes, or specific object properties (e.g., hole counts, connectivity); ensure the function handles empty grids, single-cell objects, or non-integer grid values if applicable.
 * Outputs must precisely match expected formats (e.g., strings, numbers, or modified grids); partial matches or formatting issues could fail even if logic is partially correct.
 * Consider performance for larger grids, but prioritize correctness; avoid hardcoding for specific examples to generalize across training and test cases.
 * All considerations from attempts: Basic code structure is foundational—without 'program', no logic can be tested; future attempts must include extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding connected components via flood fill) and rule application (e.g., filtering by properties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified yet, as the previous attempt lacked any functional code.
# Future attempts should include something like this for object extraction (example structure):
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Use flood fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (e.g., blobs of same value).
    # Return list of dicts with properties like {'position': (x,y), 'size': n, 'holes': count_holes(...)}
    pass
```

```python
# Example for hole counting in an object (subtle: assumes binary grid where 0s are background/holes).
def count_holes(component: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Implement boundary tracing or separate flood fill for enclosed 0-regions.
    # Return number of distinct hole areas.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (training examples 1-5 and test) failed identically due to missing 'program' function, resulting in structural errors rather than logical ones—no code was executed or evaluated for puzzle rules.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated beyond errors, so no progress on visual puzzle solving (e.g., no object extraction, rule application, or grid processing occurred).
 * What didn't work: Complete absence of required function signature prevented any testing of puzzle logic; this indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the submission format (must be a valid Python module with 'program' def).
 * No helpful functions were present or tested; any prior unhelpful code (e.g., standalone scripts without 'program') is broken for this setup and should not be reused—focus on modular functions that can be called within 'program'.
 * Missed basic requirement: Code must be importable and executable as a module; subtle formatting like indentation or syntax errors could compound issues, but here it's purely structural.
 * Train examples all errored uniformly, suggesting the attempt was a single invalid program applied to all—no variation or learning from examples was possible.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates a complete failure to meet the basic code requirement, preventing any puzzle-specific output (e.g., no processed grid, object summary, or rule-based result).
 * Expected test output should be a valid result based on mentally simulating puzzle rules on the test grid (e.g., if rules involve counting connected shapes or holes, output might be a number/string like "3 objects with 1 hole"; but without 'program', this can't be generated or verified).
 * The error differs from expectations because no puzzle logic ran—it's structurally invalid, not a mismatch in puzzle solving (e.g., wrong count or omitted object); this blocks handling test-specific subtleties like unique grid patterns or edge cases.
 * To handle the test case, ensure 'program' processes the input grid correctly (e.g., extract objects, apply rules like omitting those without holes if that's a rule—unknown without more details, but must generalize).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based visual filling puzzle (similar to a nonogram or region-coloring challenge) on a 30x22 grid, where fixed digits (0-9 except 8) act as clues in specific "clue bands" or regions to determine how to fill blank cells (8's) with either 2 (likely one color, e.g., red) or 3 (another color, e.g., blue). The goal is to propagate fills based on detected patterns of these digits across horizontal/vertical bands, ensuring consistent region completion without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Scans top band for any 0 (triggers top/mid fills)

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Pairs with zero_top for top fill=3, bottom=3

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all-0 in left for horizontal left fill

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers vertical mid and blocks some lower fills

def has_seven_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15))  # Enables middle band right fill (cols 11-20)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(set(non_eight)) == 1 and non_eight and non_eight[0] == 9  # Strict: all non-8 must be 9 for vertical far fill

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper left vertical (rows 7-12, cols 1-6)

# Aggregator for 2's in upper band (useful for lower middle fill condition)
def any_two_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any_two_left(g) or any_two_mid(g) or any_two_right(g) or any_two_far(g)

def any_four_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 4 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers lower left vertical (rows 18-23, cols 1-6)

def is_full_block_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) == 9 and len(set(non_eight)) <= 1  # Full 3x3 non-8 block in left blocks lower middle row 22
```

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a grid with predefined borders (e.g., rows of 3s and 6s) and clue areas (numbers 0-9 in rows 1-3 and a bottom clue row), where the goal is to fill unknown cells (8s) with 3s in specific regions (upper, middle, lower sections divided into left/mid/right/far columns) based on conditional rules derived from the clues, such as presence or patterns of certain digits triggering fills in rectangular or shaped areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed borders: top and bottom rows are often filled with 3s; a row of 6s appears consistently around row 5 (0-indexed); side borders are 8s that may remain unfilled or get partial 3s based on conditions.
 * Clues are in rows 1-3 (columns 2-21, grouped into left:2-5, mid:7-10, right:12-15, far:17-20) and a bottom clue row (row 29?); conditions check for any/all specific digits (e.g., any 0 or 1 in top clues triggers top fills; full zeros in left triggers middle-left fill).
 * Regions to fill are vertically/horizontally divided: upper (rows 7-11), middle (12-17), lower (18-26?); subregions like left (cols 1-6), mid (6-11), right (11-16), far (16-21); fills are rectangular blocks of 3s but sometimes shaped (e.g., specific positions for 'nine' in far right).
 * Subtleties: Fills can extend vertically across sections (e.g., long mid from 8-27 if conditions met); some fills depend on negatives (e.g., not has_one_mid); is_nine_right checks for non-8s being all 9s, but may overfill or underfill shapes; bottom row fill color (2 or 3) depends on top conditions, but often mismatches expected.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs leave large areas of 8s unfilled (e.g., row 17 in training 1 is all 8s in expected but filled with 3s in generated); upper left has specific non-rectangular patterns (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with gaps); far right 'nine' shape is irregular (specific positions like (18,16),(18,18), etc.); interactions between clues (e.g., zero_top + one_top + not full_zero_left for upper mid).
 * All attempts fill too many 8s into 3s in places where expected leaves 8s (overfilling blocks); bottom row sometimes uses wrong color (3 vs expected 2? but not shown); no handling for cases where clues like 7/9/6 trigger partial shapes vs full blocks.
 * Grid dimensions: ~30 rows x 22 cols; indices start from 0, but clues in rows 1-3; fills avoid borders (col 0/21 often 8 or 3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top clues; useful for triggering top/bottom fills

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks if left clue block is entirely 0s; key for conditional left fills

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return bool(non_eight) and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Detects if right clue is purely 9s (ignoring 8s); triggers shaped far fills

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Presence check for 2 in left; triggers specific upper left pattern
```
These functions correctly detect clue conditions and are reusable; no types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall program structure calls fill functions in sequence on a copy of g, replacing 8s with 3s based on clue checks; this works for top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0/4/29 filled correctly in training 1) and some rectangular blocks (e.g., middle right if has_seven_right), but overfills (e.g., fills long_mid even when not extending fully).
 * Training 1: Generated fills row 17 (middle lower?) with all 3s, but expected leaves it all 8s; also fills upper far with 3s via is_nine_right, but expected has no such fill in rows 8-11 cols 16-21 (mismatch in far right extension); bottom row correct as 3s, but lower left-mid overfills cols 1-11 row 18-21 where expected has 8s in row 17.
 * Training 2: Generated fills upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 with 3s, but expected leaves row 7 cols 6-11 as 8s (partial overfill); middle left/right/far underfilled (e.g., row 13 cols 1-6 expected 3s but generated 8s? Wait, generated has 3s in some but not consistently); bottom row as 3s but expected may imply 2 (not shown, unknown); also fills row 11 cols 6-11 with 3s unexpectedly.
 * Training 3: Top clues not triggering top 3s (generated starts with 8s in row 0, expected 8s—correct); but overfills upper left rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with full 3s, expected has gaps/partial in row 8; middle section rows 12-17 mostly 8s but expected fills row 17 cols 1-6/16-21 with 3s (underfill); lower far rows 22-26 overfills with 3s via fill_lower_far_two, but expected has shaped 3s only in specific cols.
 * Training 4: Top not filled (correct, starts 8s); middle rows 12-17 overfills cols 1-6 and 11-16 with 3s via fill_middle_left/right, but expected leaves row 17 cols 6-11/16-21 as 8s; lower mid row 18 underfills (generated 8s in cols 1-5, expected 3s?); bottom row 2s correct? but generated has 6s row 5 correct.
 * Training 5: Top filled with 3s unexpectedly (generated row 0 3s, expected 8s—overfill); upper right overfills cols 16-20 rows 8-11 with 3s, expected partial; middle far underfills rows 12-17 cols 16-21 (8s, expected 3s in some); lower left-mid fills row 18 cols 1-11 with 3s correctly? but row 19 cols 16-20 mismatched (generated 3s in gaps).
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: fill_upper_left_specific (hardcodes positions but overfills gaps, e.g., row 8 cols 2/4 as 3s when expected 8s in some cases); fill_lower_far_nine (specific positions but applies unconditionally if is_nine_right, leading to mismatches like filling (18,17) which may not be expected); fill_long_mid (extends too far, e.g., to row 26 when expected stops at 17); fill_bottom (uses 3 always if top conditions, but some expected bottoms are 2s or unfilled—broken logic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills top rows 0-4 with 3s (expected likely 8s based on training 3/4/5 patterns where top clues like 0/1/9 don't always trigger full top fill); upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 filled fully with 3s, but likely partial or none needed (similar to training 2 underfill issue); middle rows 12-17 cols 1-6 filled but row 12 cols 6-11/16-21 left 8s (underfill, expected shaped based on bottom clues 0/6?); lower far rows 22-26 has partial 3s in cols 16-21 but gaps like row 22 col 17=8 (mismatch, looks like incomplete 'nine' shape); bottom row 29 not shown but implied 3s, may be wrong if test clues suggest 2; overall, too many 3s in left/mid, leaving right/far inconsistent—does not make sense as it ignores negative conditions (e.g., not full_zero_left) and shaped fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where fixed digits (0-9, 6's on certain rows) provide clues to fill blank spaces (8's) with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on pattern-matching conditions derived from the positions and combinations of those digits; the goal is to replicate exact expected fillings across training examples, likely simulating rules for shading or completing a hidden image/diagram without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are often fully filled with 3's or 2's based on top/bottom conditions; row 5 and 29 are always 6's; rows 6-7 and some lower rows start as 8's but may get filled; the puzzle divides into vertical sections (left: cols 1-6, mid: 6-11, right: 11-21) and horizontal bands (upper: rows 8-12, middle: 12-18/23, lower: 18-28).
 * Filling only occurs where 8's exist—never overwrite non-8 cells; use value 3 for fills, but some conditions lead to 2's (e.g., bottom if no zero/one top).
 * Conditions are conditional and sometimes mutually exclusive: e.g., long vertical mid fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if one in mid AND two far-right; upper far-right fill if mostly 9's in right (not all 8's); bottom far if two far AND no one mid.
 * Subtle overlaps/conflicts: multiple fills can overlap (e.g., middle mid and long mid both target mid section, but order matters to avoid partial fills); some regions like lower left-mid (rows 17-23, cols 1-11) only if four in mid, but this may conflict with other middle fills.
 * Digit detection is row-restricted (e.g., tops in rows 1-4, cols 0-22; mid in rows 1-4, cols 7-11; left in cols 2-5/6; right in cols 12-16/17-21); "full zero left" requires ALL zeros in a subregion, while others are "any" (existence).
 * Easy to miss: "is_nine_right" checks for non-8 cells in right being ALL 9's (not just any 9); no fill if condition partial (e.g., mixed 7/8/9 in right doesn't trigger nine fill); bottom row fill to 2's if no zero AND one top; some examples have pre-filled 3's outside 8's, so program must copy input faithfully.
 * Across attempts: order of fill functions matters (early fills like top/bottom set global, later ones like middle may depend); unhandled cases like pre-existing 3's in input (e.g., training 3 has them in row 7) can cause mismatches if not copied; right section fills are tricky (e.g., seven_right any 7 triggers wide middle right, but nine_right needs purity).
 * General: Puzzle emphasizes precision—small mismatches (e.g., one cell wrong) fail the example; test cases vary in digit placements, so rules must generalize without hardcoding per-example.

 * Training example 1 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 17 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (middle left over-filled, likely due to full_zero_left triggering despite context); also filled row 28-29 with 3's but expected 2's in some spots? Wait, actually bottoms match, but row 17 mismatch suggests middle_left fill ignores upper/middle interactions; subtle: expected has 8's in row 17 left, so condition like full_zero_left may be too broad or misranged (cols 2-5 vs 1-6).
 * Training example 2 CORRECT: All fills matched exactly, indicating core top/bottom, upper left (if two left), long mid (if one mid + two far), upper far (if nine right), middle sections, lower left-mid (if four mid), lower mid (if two mid), and lower far (if two far no one mid) worked perfectly here—likely because this example had clean, non-overlapping conditions without pre-filled 3's.
 * Training example 3 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 7 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (upper left triggered wrongly? Input has no two left in rows 1-4? Wait, input row 1-3 have 2's in left, but perhaps range issue); also row 23 (cols 1-6) filled with 3's expected 8's (lower left overreach); row 24 has extra 3's in right where expected 8's (long mid or middle right spillover); bottom rows 30-31 are 2's matching, but upper/middle mismatches suggest mishandling pre-existing 3's in row 7 or incorrect any_two_left detection.
 * Training example 4 INCORRECT: Generated row 17 (cols 1-6 and 6-11) filled with 3's where expected 8's in left-mid (middle left/mid triggered wrongly, perhaps full_zero_left false but still filled? Input has zeros left but not full; also row 18 over-filled); row 22-23 have partial 3's in left where expected 8's (lower left-mid if four mid, but input has no 4 mid? Mismatch unknown); row 24 empty matching, but middle sections differ by entire bands.
 * Training example 5 INCORRECT: Generated row 7 all 8's matching, but row 8 right has 3's interspersed (e.g., col 16-21) where expected none (upper far triggered wrongly—input has 9's in right but mixed with 3's? is_nine_right fails purity); row 12 filled left-mid with 3's expected 8's (middle left/mid over); row 17-18 filled with 3's expected partial; row 23 right has 3's where expected 8's (lower far triggered despite one mid present?); bottoms 3's but input suggests 2's possible.
 * Overall: Works for clean cases (ex 2) but fails on overlaps/pre-fills (ex 3-5) and strict conditions (ex 1,4); fill order helps but misses exclusions (e.g., don't fill if region already partial); no extraction of full objects, but detection funcs are solid—unhelpful: none really broken, but is_nine_right too narrow (cols 12-16 only, misses far-right 17-21); full_zero_left range (2-5) may need tweak to 1-6 for some.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-fills row 7 (cols 6-11) with 3's where likely expected 8's (long mid triggered, but input has one mid in rows 1-4 cols 7-11, yet two far present—condition may need stricter check); row 8-11 left/mid/right have 3's interspersed (e.g., cols 1-6,6-11,16-21) matching some upper fills, but cols 12-16 empty where seven_right absent (no 7's, correct no fill); row 12 left empty but mid empty (middle mid if one mid, but perhaps blocked by long mid?); row 17-18 over-filled mid/right with 3's expected partial/empty (middle right if seven, but no 7); row 22-23 left-mid filled if four mid (input has 4's in rows 18-20? Wait, clues in 1-4, but lower detect any_four_mid); row 24-27 right has 3's in cols 16-21 expected empty (lower far if two far no one mid, but one mid present); bottoms 3's due to zero/one top present, seems correct; overall, too many 3's in middle/lower, suggesting program fills without checking for pre-3's or condition negations, and test likely expects sparser fills like training 3/4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 30x22 grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 represent colors, with 8 as background and 3 as green highlight), where the top 5 rows contain a key pattern embedded in 8's, and the goal is to conditionally highlight (fill non-8 cells or backgrounds with 3) matching or similar patterns in designated middle sections (e.g., rows 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27) while setting the bottom 2 rows (28-29) to all 3's or 2's based on whether the top pattern meets a specific criterion (likely exactly 84 eights in the top 5 rows x 22 columns = 110 cells, implying 26 patterned cells). Other rows like dividers (all 6's in row 5, all 8's in some separators) remain unchanged, and the highlighting preserves the internal pattern colors while replacing surrounding 8's with 3's to "frame" or emphasize matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top 5 rows (0-4) serve as a key: if they contain exactly 84 eights (measured before any modifications), trigger green (3) filling in the top itself (replacing 8's but preserving non-8 pattern cells) and in matching middle sections; otherwise, leave the top unchanged and selectively green-fill only lower sections that match the key pattern independently.
 * Middle sections are bounded by all-8 or all-6 rows (e.g., rows 6-7 all 8's as separator, row 11 all 8's, row 17 all 8's, row 21-22 all 8's); green-filling typically replaces 8's in columns 1-20 (leaving border 8's in columns 0 and 21 intact) within pattern areas of rows like 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27, but only for sections whose internal non-8 patterns mirror the top key's shape/structure (e.g., blob-like clusters of 0's, 1's, etc., in similar positions).
 * Bottom rows (28-29) are set to all 3's if the top condition is met (indicating "match found" or "key valid"), otherwise all 2's; this acts as an indicator strip.
 * Subtleties: Patterns are not always fully symmetric or identical—matching may be based on shape topology (e.g., connected components, hole counts, or bounding boxes) rather than exact cell values; in some cases (e.g., train 3,5), top is not green-filled even if patterns exist, suggesting the 84-eight rule applies only to specific key types, while lower sections can be filled independently if they "match" the top regardless of count. Dividers (row 5 all 6's) and separator rows must remain untouched. Borders (columns 0,21) often stay 8 in filled sections for framing. Count eights only in top rows 0-4, columns 0-21, before any changes to avoid state mutation issues.
 * Easy-to-miss: Green-filling in middles is selective per section (e.g., in train 2, only columns 6-10 in rows 7-11 and 23-27 get 3's around a partial match; in train 1, full sections 12-16 filled); not all 8's in a section are replaced—only those surrounding patterns that match the key. In cases like train 3/4/5, top patterns vary (e.g., all-8 top in train 3 means no top fill, but lower matches trigger isolated fills). Internal pattern colors (e.g., 0,1,2,4,6,7,9) must be preserved, not overwritten. The puzzle may involve extracting "objects" (connected non-8 regions) to compare shapes across sections.
 * All rows not mentioned (e.g., 26-27 in some) may need conditional filling based on pattern similarity; test input has a unique top pattern (0's in col 2-4 row1-3, 1's in col7-9/7 row1-3, etc.), suggesting partial matches in lower sections like rows 18-20 or 23-25.

    # Simple match: compare sorted relative positions
    return key_pattern.shape_hash == section_pattern.shape_hash
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single program attempt across all training examples failed entirely (all marked INCORRECT), primarily due to execution order: greenify_top_if_condition modifies the top (replacing 8's with 3's) before subsequent functions like set_bottom_based_on_top_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition check count_eights_in_top == 84, causing the count to drop below 84 post-modification, so bottom stays 2's (expected 3's in train 1/2) and middles remain unfilled (e.g., row 12 all 8's instead of bordered 3's in train 1).
 * Top greenification worked partially in train 1/2 (correctly replaced 8's with 3's while preserving patterns in rows 0-4), but failed in train 3/4/5 where top should remain unchanged (generated filled with 3's around patterns, but expected keeps original 8-background patterns without 3's, e.g., row 0 all 8's in train 3).
 * Middle filling (rows 12-17, cols 1-20) never triggered due to the mutated count, so sections like rows 12-16 stayed all 8's or original in all trains (e.g., train 1 expected bordered 3's with preserved 7/1/6/0 patterns, but generated all 8's; train 2 expected partial 3's in cols 6-10 rows 7-11/23-27, but generated unchanged).
 * Bottom setting always defaulted to 2's due to failed condition (e.g., train 1/2 expected all 3's, but generated all 2's; train 3/4/5 expected all 2's? but generated all 2's correctly by accident, though other parts wrong).
 * copy_pink_rows was a no-op (just returns copy), unhelpful and irrelevant (no "pink" mentioned, likely a red herring or broken remnant).
 * greenify_top_if_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition are partially helpful for the filling logic (preserve non-8's, target specific ranges), but broken by not checking condition before modification and lacking pattern matching— they blindly fill all 8's in ranges if condition met, missing selective section-based matching (e.g., train 2 only fills specific columns, not full range).
 * set_bottom_based_on_top_condition is conceptually useful for the indicator but broken by post-modification check; should check original input count.
 * No pattern extraction or matching implemented, leading to over-generalized filling (e.g., train 3 generated top/middle 3's incorrectly, ignoring that top didn't qualify for 84 eights); count_eights_in_top is helpful but must be called on original grid copy.
 * Train 1: Top correct, but middle unfilled (row 12 all 8's vs expected 8-3's-8), bottom 2's vs 3's; patterns in rows 13-15 expected preserved in 3-background but generated unchanged 8's.
 * Train 2: Top correct, but no 3's in rows 7-11/23-27 cols 6-10 (generated unchanged vs expected 3's around partial matches), bottom 2's vs 3's; also missed green in row 7 cols 6-10.
 * Train 3: Top incorrectly green-filled (generated 3's around patterns in rows 0-4 vs expected original 8-background), no selective lower fills (e.g., expected 3's in rows 7-11 cols 2-5/7-10? but generated unchanged); bottom correct by default but overall mismatch.
 * Train 4: Top unchanged correctly (but expected green? wait, no—generated top original, but expected some 3's in row 12-16; actually mismatched as middle unfilled vs expected bordered 3's).
 * Train 5: Top unchanged but expected partial 3's in lower sections (generated no changes vs expected 3's in rows 7-11/17-21 cols 16-20?); patterns mismatched for unknown reason (e.g., row 8 col 16-20 expected 3's around 9's but generated 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output makes no changes to the input grid (top rows 0-4 remain 8-background with patterns like 0's/1's/9's/2's unchanged, no 3's anywhere, bottom all 2's), which does not look correct because the top pattern (e.g., 0's in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, 1's in row 1 cols 7-9 and row 3 cols 7-9, etc.) likely qualifies as a valid key (count 8's to check ~84?), so expected top green-fill (3's replacing 8's around patterns), selective middle green-fills in matching sections (e.g., rows 12-16 or 18-20 may have similar 1/0/6/0 clusters needing 3-borders), and bottom all 3's; instead, it's entirely static, suggesting the condition failed entirely (possibly top count !=84, or order bug prevented any action).
 * No green highlighting in any middle sections (e.g., rows 13-15 have 7/1/6/0 patterns unchanged vs likely expected 3's bordering them if matching top), and bottom 2's vs probable 3's; this ignores potential partial matches (e.g., the 2/0/7/9 in rows 8-10 may not match, but 4/2/5/1 in 18-20 or 9/6/4/2 in 23-25 might).
 * Overall, test output looks incorrect as it treats the grid as "no matches" despite visible similar blob shapes (e.g., triple 0's/1's in top mirroring lower 7's/1's), failing to demonstrate any understanding of selective filling—needs pattern extraction to confirm matches before filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) where cells contain color codes (integers like 0 for empty, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc., up to 9) and 8 as a placeholder to be filled based on patterns or rules derived from the top section of the grid (roughly rows 0-4). The goal is to fill 8's in specific regions of the middle section (rows ~7-27) with 3 (green) according to structural or conditional rules (e.g., based on top colors, zero counts, or special configurations), while setting the bottom two rows (28-29) to either all 3 (green) or all 2 (red) depending on whether the top qualifies as "special." Fixed rows like 5 and 25 are all 6's (possibly a separator or background), and edges are often 8's that may or may not get filled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top section (rows 0-4) determines overall behavior: count of 8's in rows 0-4 (special if exactly 84), count of 0's in rows 1-3 (e.g., ==9 triggers specific fills), and set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3 (e.g., {2,4} or {1,9} triggers region-specific fills).
 * Bottom rows 28-29 are uniformly set to 3 if top is special (fill_top_with_green also applies), else to 2; this is consistent across examples but overrides other logic.
 * Middle fills target 8's only, preserving existing colors/0's; regions include vertical strips (e.g., cols 6-10 rows 7-17), partial rows (e.g., row 12 and 16 cols 1-20, with specific cols in 13-15), and "train"-like areas (e.g., left/bottom-right blobs filled conditionally).
 * Subtleties: Fills are not global—e.g., fill_full_second fills rows 12-17 cols 1-20 completely if conditions met, but fill_partial_second is more selective (top/bottom of that block + specific cols); vertical_middle is a narrow strip; train3_regions fills three disconnected areas (left upper, bottom-left middle, bottom-right lower); train5_regions fills two vertical-ish areas. Existing non-8 cells (e.g., 0's, colors) block or pattern-match fills.
 * Easy to miss: Top colors exclude 0/8 but include scattered non-8's that form patterns (e.g., blobs of 1's, 2's); zeros==9 suggests a specific sparse top pattern. Special check is row-limited (only top 5 rows, all cols). Edges (col 0/21) often remain 8 or get partial fills. Fixed rows (5,25 all 6's; sometimes top/bottom all 8's or 3's) must not be altered. Bottom green requires special=true, but red is default.
 * Across attempts: Program applies fills sequentially but conditionally (if special then green bottom + top fill, else red bottom); then nested ifs for middle based on zeros/special/colors, with else fallback to partial_second. This works for ex1 but overfills or underfills regions in others (e.g., filling where expected is 8 or different color). No rotation/flipping; assumes grid is oriented with patterns like "trains" or blobs in fixed positions.
 * Considerations: Patterns in top/middle suggest object detection (e.g., connected components of same color), but current code uses hardcoded regions—may miss dynamic shapes. 8's are fillers, but some expected outputs leave 8's unfilled (e.g., ex3 top is all 8's, not filled). Bottom red in ex3/4/5 but generated green in some. Test input has mixed top (0's and colors like 1,9,2), suggesting partial_second or train logic, but generated fills middle with green in wrong spots.

Note: No object extraction function present; hardcoded regions work for ex1 but fail dynamically. set_bottom_green/red are simple but essential for bottom uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Ex1 correct: Likely matched special or zeros==9 with full fills, producing exact green regions and bottom green; top fill and middle logic aligned perfectly (no differences noted).
 * Ex2 incorrect: Generated fills rows 18-20/23-25 with green in positions like (18,6-10)=3 (but expected 8 there? Wait, expected has 3's in (18,6-10) actually—no, diff is in rows 18-20: generated has no 3's in col 6-10 for row 18-20, but expected has 3's there; also row 23-25 col 0-5/16-20 get partial green but expected full 3's in some blob shapes (e.g., expected (23,6-10)=3 but generated 8). Bottom green correct, but middle underfills "train" areas; top colors {1,2,6,9?} fallback to partial_second overfills row 12-16 selectively wrong.
 * Ex3 incorrect: Generated sets top rows 0-4 to all 3's (but expected all 8's—no fill); bottom to green (expected red); middle fills like rows 7-17 cols 6-10=3 (but expected partial or 8 in some); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; rows 23-26 cols 16-20 partial green but expected more structured (e.g., col 16-20 row 23=3 but with extensions). Overfills based on assuming special=false but colors={2,4}? Actually top has 2/4 blobs, so triggered train3 but filled wrong regions; bottom should be red since not special.
 * Ex4 incorrect: Generated fills rows 12-16 cols 0-21 with green blobs (e.g., row 12 all 3's but expected row 12 cols 6-20=3 partial); row 13-15 have 3's around existing 7/1/6/0 but expected more uniform 3's in cols 6-20; row 17 no fill (correct?); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; bottom red correct. Underfills lower middle (e.g., rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20=8 but expected some 3's); zeros in top==9? but triggered partial_second wrongly, ignoring blob shapes around 7/1/6.
 * Ex5 incorrect: Generated top rows 0-4 unchanged (correct, all 8's? No, top has 1/9 blobs, expected unchanged); but row 7 cols 6-10=3 (expected 8); row 17 cols 16-21=3 partial (expected 8); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=3 but expected 8/3 mixed; rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20 no fill but expected 3's in some; bottom red correct. Triggered train5 for {1,9} but overfills vertical middle instead of exact train5 regions; partial_second fallback wrong for scattered 1's.
 * Overall: Hardcoded regions help for static fills but miss dynamic blob extension (e.g., fill around existing colors like in ex2 expected row 18 col6-10=3 extending from top); special check works but top fill overapplies in non-special (ex3); colors set detection good but {2,4}/{1,9} triggers wrong for mixed tops; zeros==9 not handling full vs partial accurately (ex4 underfills). No function for blob detection—essential for extending fills to match shapes (e.g., connect 8's to existing colors). fill_top_with_green limited to top 5 but name/code confusing. program() copies grid correctly but sequential ifs cause fallback overfill (else: partial_second too broad).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Top rows 0-4 unchanged (has 0's and blobs of 1/9/2—correct, no full fill); but middle row 12-16 filled with full green block cols 0-21 (e.g., row 12 all 3's, but likely should be partial around existing 7/1/6/0/9); row 17 no fill (8's, possibly correct); rows 18-20 cols 0-5/11-15/21=8 but cols 6-10=8 (should extend to 3? based on ex patterns); rows 23-25 cols 0-5=8 but expected some green extension for 2-blob; bottom red (correct for non-special). Top colors ~{1,2,9}, zeros~9?, so should trigger partial_second or train mix, but generated overfills row 12-16 uniformly (ignores existing 0/7/1/6/9 shapes) and underfills lower (no train3/5 for {1,9}+2). Looks like fallback partial_second applied wrongly—missing blob-aware filling to match expected structured greens around colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) with fixed structural elements (e.g., bands of 3s, 2s, or 6s in specific rows) and clue numbers (0,1,2,7,9) placed in certain positions, where the goal is to replace all 8s (unknown cells) with either 2 or 3 to form coherent regions or "blobs" based on positional rules and interactions between clues. The filling rules appear to propagate from clue conditions to fill rectangular regions, with 3 often indicating a "primary" or connected fill and 2 a "secondary" or default fill, while avoiding overfilling or conflicting with existing clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed bands: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are horizontal bands filled entirely with 3 or 2; row 5 and row 30 are always full 6s (perhaps dividers or walls); rows 6-7 and 25-27 often start as 8s but get partial fills.
 * Clues (0,1,2,7,9) are checked in specific subregions (e.g., "top" clues in rows 1-3, cols 0-21 for 0/1/2; "left" in cols 2-4; "mid" in cols 7-10; "right" in cols 12-15 or 16-20), and conditions like "has_zero_top" or "is_nine_right" (which requires all non-8s in a region to be 9 and at least one present) trigger fills only in 8s within target rectangles.
 * Subtleties include conditional dependencies: e.g., bottom band fills with 3 only if top clues have both 0 and 1; upper left fill extends to col 6 under specific 2 placements; long mid (rows 8-26, cols 6-10) requires both 1 in mid and 2 in far right; row 17 mid fill depends on negation (not full_zero_left); lower far has early/late variants based on 1-left vs. (2-far and not 1-mid).
 * Order of function calls in program() matters, as fills only target 8s and later fills can overwrite if regions overlap (though current code avoids this by sequential non-overlapping regions).
 * Easy-to-miss: Fills are rectangular but sometimes partial (e.g., upper left adds col 6 conditionally); "full_zero_left" requires all three cells in rows 1-3, cols 2-4 to be 0 (not any); no fills touch clue positions (preserves 0/1/2/7/9); bottom rows 28-29 default to 2 unless top condition met; some regions like middle right (rows 12-16, cols 11-20) fill broadly if 7 in right.
 * Across attempts, issues include overfilling (e.g., filling where clues block or conditions not fully met), underfilling (e.g., missing propagations to adjacent cols like 6 or 11), ignoring negations (e.g., not full_zero_left), and mishandling "is_nine_right" (fills even if mixed non-8s). Test cases highlight sensitivity to clue interactions across vertical bands (left/mid/right).
 * No rotation or symmetry assumed; all checks are absolute positions. 8s outside defined regions may remain unfilled, but expectations show all 8s filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current code uses simple any/all comprehensions for conditions, which are helpful for quick regional checks. No complex types or extractions needed yet, but potential for region-specific validators.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks entire top band for 0 (helpful for global top/bottom trigger)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Useful for strict "all clues are 9" without 8s interfering

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(r_start, r_end + 1):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Core filling tool; only targets 8s, preserves clues
```

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_upper_far` relies on `is_nine_right` which may misfire if region has 8s mixed with non-9s (it collects non-8s correctly but assumes presence implies fill—subtle bug in some cases). `fill_row17_mid` uses complex negation which failed in Train3/5. No object extraction functions present or needed; simple grid iteration suffices.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct—properly filled top/bottom bands with 3s (due to 0/1 top presence), upper/middle/lower regions with 3s based on 2-left, 1-mid, 7-right, etc.; no over/underfills observed.
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated extra 3s in row7 cols6-10 (should be 8s, as no long_mid trigger without 2-far?); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left requires full_zero_left, which isn't met); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (condition (has_one_mid and not full_zero_left) or any_two_mid not fully satisfied); row22 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (no upper_left propagation?); overall, overfilled mid/left regions without strict conditions.
 * Train3: Incorrect—underfilled row7 (expected 3s in cols1-5, but generated 8s—upper_left missed due to no 2-left? Wait, clues have 2s there); row11 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left overtriggered); row16 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle regions missed); row17 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s in cols6-10 only? No, expectations show row17 all 8s except mid 3s—generated missed mid; row18 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s initially then propagated; bottom rows 30-31 are 2s as expected but top clues lacked 0/1 pair? Major issue: left/mid fills inconsistent with negations and propagations.
 * Train4: Correct—handled complex interactions like 1-left triggering lower_far_early, 2-top for lower_mid, etc.; all regions filled precisely without extras.
 * Train5: Incorrect—row12 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_mid triggered wrongly without strict 1-mid?); row16 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle_left missed); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (row17_mid overtriggered); row21 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_left/mid missed due to no 2-left/top?); row22 all 8s but expected partial 3s in lower; overfilled some right regions with 3s where 8s expected (e.g., row8-11 cols16-20).
 * General: Conditions like full_zero_left and negations (not full_zero_left) often fail, leading to missed or extra mid fills; upper_far works when 9s present but not if mixed; long_mid undertriggers without 2-far; no function for extracting full clue regions (e.g., to validate blob shapes), which might help debug; fill order causes no overwrites but misses chained fills (e.g., upper to middle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—while top/bottom bands are properly 3s (due to 0-top and 1-top present), and some regions like upper left (rows8-11 cols1-5=3s), middle mid (rows12-16 cols6-10=3s), lower left/mid (rows18-21 cols1-5/6-10=3s) match expectations, there are mismatches: row7 cols1-5 are 8s but should be 3s (upper_left trigger from 2-left present, but code's any_two_left should catch it—possible col range issue in fill_upper_left); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but if not full_zero_left (clues show mixed 0s), expected 8s; row22 cols16-20 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_far_late should trigger from 2-far and not 1-mid? Clues have 2s far right); row24-26 cols16-20 partial 3s but code filled full, mismatching sparse 2-clue positions; overall, underfills vertical propagations (e.g., row22-26 left/mid should chain from upper) and overfills bottom mid without negation check; does not make complete sense as some 8s remain (e.g., row7, row22 partial), violating full-fill expectation, and ignores subtle extensions like col6 in upper left.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided train input-output pairs (5 examples), I focused only on obvious, direct connections or interactions between elements that are **consistent across EVERY example**. I ignored non-interacting or irrelevant elements (e.g., fixed pink borders at y=5 and y=27, which never change; individual grid shapes in rows below the top row, which never transform). I did not identify high-level puzzle rules or attempt a full solution. Connections are limited to those where one element's properties (e.g., color, position, holes, pixels) directly affect or transform another's in a repeatable way across all cases. If a transformation (e.g., exact positioning) could not be explained consistently without speculation, it is noted as unknown.

#### 1. **Main Maroon Background ([0,6,21,26]) ↔ New Green Components (Multiple)**
   - **Interaction**: The main Maroon background component always loses a specific number of pixels (D, varying per example: 74, 74, 73, 75, 55). Simultaneously, one or more new Green components are added within or overlapping the main background's bbox ([0,6,21,26]). The total pixels across all new Green components exactly equals D in every example (e.g., single Green with 74 pixels, or multiple summing to 74/75/55). This indicates a consistent recoloring effect: pixels from the Maroon background are transformed to Green.
   - **Additional Properties**:
     - The Maroon component's holes always decrease (by 3, 4, 6, 1, 3 respectively), but the exact amount is not tied to a consistent property (e.g., not directly linked to top row shapes or D).
     - New Green components always have color=Green, holes ≥0, and bboxes fully contained within [0,6,21,26]. They never overlap or alter existing non-background shapes.
   - **Consistency**: Present and exact (pixel sum match) in all 5 examples. No exceptions.
   - **Unknown**: The exact bboxes, number of Green components (1–4), and their individual holes/pixels vary and depend on top row configuration (e.g., shapes in y=1–3). Cannot explain positions or splitting without forcing inconsistent rules (e.g., not always vertical columns, not always horizontal strips, not fixed D).

#### 2. **Top Row Blue Shape ([7,1,9,3], pixels=7) ↔ Top Border ([0,0,21,4]) and Bottom Border ([0,28,21,29])**
   - **Interaction**: If a Blue component exists with exact properties (bbox=[7,1,9,3], holes=0, pixels=7; present in train inputs 1 and 2), both borders transform color while keeping holes and pixels unchanged:
     - Top border changes from Maroon to Green.
     - Bottom border changes from Maroon to Green (holes=0, pixels=44).
   - In all other cases (no such Blue shape; train inputs 3, 4, 5):
     - Top border remains Maroon (keeps input holes and pixels unchanged).
     - Bottom border changes from Maroon to Red (holes=0, pixels=44).
   - **Consistency**: The conditional color change (Green vs. Red) based on presence of this exact Blue shape occurs in all 5 examples. No partial matches (e.g., similar Blue shapes with different bbox/pixels, like [7,1,8,3] pixels=4 in input 5, trigger Red instead of Green).
   - **Unknown**: Why this specific Blue shape (likely a consistent "H" form based on bbox/pixels) triggers Green vs. Red; no deeper link to other elements (e.g., not affecting main Green pixels D).

#### 3. **Grid Shapes (All Non-Background, Non-Border Components) ↔ No Transformations**
   - **Interaction**: All colored grid shapes (e.g., Red singles at [2,8,2,8], Light Blue at [17,8,19,10], etc.; all with bboxes in y≥8) remain completely unchanged (color, holes, bbox, pixels) from input to output. They do not interact with or affect any background recoloring, borders, or new Greens (no overlaps, no color shifts, no movement).
   - **Consistency**: Zero changes to these ~20 components across all 5 examples. They are "static" and do not connect to varying elements (e.g., top row or backgrounds).
   - **Note**: Top row shapes (y=1–3, varying per input) also remain unchanged individually but indirectly affect borders (see #2) and main Green positions (unknown, see #1).

#### Non-Consistent or Irrelevant Elements (Excluded per Instructions)
- Small isolated components like Maroon [18,24,18,24] p=1: Sometimes changes to Green (e.g., output 3), sometimes stays Maroon (outputs 1,2,4,5)—not consistent across all.
- Top row shapes other than the specific Blue (e.g., Pink [18,1,19,3] p=5, Red [17,1,19,3] p=6): Vary per input but do not consistently transform or affect specific elements (e.g., no reliable link to D or Green positions).
- Top border holes/pixels: Vary slightly (e.g., 4/84 vs. 7/79) but only change color conditionally (see #2); no other interactions.
- No position → color links beyond #2 (e.g., no consistent hole count → transform across all).
- No movement/edge/silhouette effects: All bboxes fixed; no evidence of transformation based on shape properties like edges or holes (except the noted Blue).

These are the only obvious, consistent interactions. No other connections (e.g., color → position, specific shape → D) hold across every example without inconsistency. If more data were provided, unknown aspects (e.g., Green bbox rule) might clarify, but based on this, they remain unexplained.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:10:40] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle where a 30x22 grid containing numbers 0-9 (as clues or partial shapes) and 8's (blanks to be filled) must have the 8's replaced selectively with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on detecting the presence or patterns of certain numbers in predefined sub-regions (e.g., left, mid, right areas across rows). The goal is to "complete" visual elements like bars, frames, or object outlines by filling only when clues indicate a match, while leaving some 8's unfilled to preserve structure; entire rows or blocks (e.g., top/bottom) may fill with 3's or 2's conditionally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural rows: rows 0-4 and 28-29 often fill entirely with 3's (or 2's if top conditions fail), row 5 and 25-26 with 6's, row 6/7/11/12/16/17/21/22/27/28 with potential 8's or partial fills; vertical bars (e.g., col 0/21 often 8's) and horizontal dividers must not be over-filled.
 * Clues are sparse numbers in rows 1-3 (top), 8-10 (upper mid), 12-16 (lower mid), 18-20 (bottom left/mid), 23-25 (bottom right); detect "any" presence (e.g., one 0 or 1 in a column range) or "all non-8" patterns (e.g., all non-8's are 9's in a region) to trigger fills, but only fill 8's, not overwriting existing numbers.
 * Subtleties: Fills are region-specific (e.g., left: cols 1-6 or 2-5, mid: 6-11 or 7-11, right: 11-21 or 12-16/16-21); order matters (early fills like top can affect later checks); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill divider rows like 17/22 if conditions partial); "full_zero_left" requires all in range ==0, not "any"; "is_nine_right" checks non-8's are all 9's but allows 8's; bottom fills (e.g., rows 18-22) depend on combos like has_one_mid + any_two_far for tall verticals, but exclude if not full match; test cases show asymmetric patterns (e.g., 2's or 4's scattered, not uniform).
 * Easy to miss: Some regions overlap (e.g., right fills span 11-21, affecting far right); conditions like "not has_one_mid" prevent fills in alternatives; bottom rows 28-29 always 3's if top has both 0 and 1, else 2's; vertical consistency (e.g., if left has any_two, fill rows 7-12 cols 1-6); no fills in cols 0/21 or row edges if 8's there; puzzle preserves "shapes" like 7's in right or 0's in mid without overwriting.
 * All attempts consider row ranges like 7-27 for tall fills, but miss partial matches (e.g., if two_far but no one_mid, fill only subset); include checks for scattered clues (e.g., any_four_mid triggers bottom left fill); avoid filling if clue is isolated (e.g., single 2 doesn't always trigger).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top row, specific col? Range(22) seems like col 22 only, but may be typo for full width.

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown (same program for all) passed training example 2 (full logic worked for that case's clues, e.g., top 0+1 triggered full top/bottom 3's, and mid/right conditions aligned without overfill).
 * Failed training 1: Over-filled row 17 (cols 6-11 and possibly others) with 3's due to has_one_mid and any_two_far triggering tall fill range(7,27) mid, but expected keeps it 8's (likely because two_far is in bottom rows 18-22, not top rows 1-3 for the check; check ranges mismatch clue locations).
 * Failed training 3: Filled row 7 left with 3's (correct), but row 17 left/mid empty in generated vs expected filled row 17 empty but row 18 filled correctly; also bottom row 28-29 filled with 2's incorrectly (top lacked 0+1?); row 22 filled partially wrong (expected 3's in right but generated 8's); any_two_left triggered upper left but missed lower dependencies.
 * Failed training 4: Top filled correctly with 0's present, but row 17 mid filled with 3's incorrectly (expected 8's, similar to train 1 overfill); row 18 left filled but expected empty in some; bottom row 28-29 with 2's wrong (should be 3's); is_nine_right not triggered properly, leaving right partial.
 * Failed training 5: Top not filled (no 0/1 in top? generated keeps 8's row 0-4); row 8 right over-filled with 3's in col 16-20; row 17 empty correct but row 18 mid over-filled; has_one_mid triggered tall mid but expected partial (e.g., row 7 empty); bottom 28-29 with 2's wrong.
 * Conditions like any_two_far use top rows 1-3 but clues often in bottom (e.g., rows 18-22), causing false positives/negatives; full_zero_left too strict for partial 0's; no function to check bottom-specific clues (e.g., any_two in rows 18-20); fill_region helpful but ranges too broad (e.g., range(7,27) fills dividers); is_nine_right useful but range(12,16) misses far right; no extraction for full shapes (e.g., count 9's exactly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top/bottom filled with 3's correctly assuming 0+1 in top row 1-3; left/mid/right regions filled in rows 12-17 based on 7/1/0 clues; bottom rows 18-22 filled with 3's around 4/2/1/5 clues) but does not look fully correct: over-fills row 7-11 mid/right with 3's (e.g., col 6-11 in row 8 has 3's around 0's, but may encroach on upper structure; expected likely keeps some 8's for separation); row 23-27 right over-filled vertically (e.g., col 6-11 in 23-27 has 3's around 6's, but test has scattered 9's/6's/2's suggesting partial fill only); row 12 left filled but col 1-6 has 3's overwriting potential edges; differences from logic: any_two_far likely false (2's in bottom col 17-21, not checked there), yet tall mid fill happened, mismatching train 1 issue; bottom row 28-29 correct as 3's, but overall too many 3's in verticals (e.g., col 3 in rows 7-27 all 3's, likely breaks shape); does not account for no has_seven_right (9's instead), so right fill range(12,17) cols 11-21 wrong—expected partial 8's preserved.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 09:11:16] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 5 train input/output pairs, below is a list of consistent interactions or connections between components. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships that appear in **every** train example (or via presence/absence across all). Only properties like color, position (bbox), pixel count, and holes are considered where they reliably influence changes. No high-level puzzle solving or irrelevant/static elements (e.g., unchanged pink lines at y=5/27, fixed small reds at y=8/10, or static lower shapes at y=18-25) are included. Unknown mappings (e.g., exact position-to-position transformations for variable greens) are noted as such rather than speculated.

1. **Top background color change triggered by specific left-top shape**:
   - Component: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[7,1,9,3], pixels=7).
   - Interaction: When present in input top row (y=0-4), changes top background Maroon (holes=4, bbox=[0,0,21,4], pixels=84) to Green (same holes, bbox, pixels).
   - Consistency: Present in trains 1-2 (change occurs); absent in trains 3-5 (no change; top stays Maroon, though pixel counts may vary slightly due to top shapes, e.g., 83/85/90).

2. **Bottom background color change triggered by same left-top shape**:
   - Component: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[7,1,9,3], pixels=7).
   - Interaction: When present in input top row (y=0-4), changes bottom background Maroon (holes=0, bbox=[0,28,21,29], pixels=44) to Green (same holes, bbox, pixels). When absent, changes to Red (same holes, bbox, pixels).
   - Consistency: Present in trains 1-2 (to Green); absent in trains 3-5 (to Red). Always a color change from Maroon in every train.

3. **Middle background pixel conservation via green addition**:
   - Components: Middle Maroon (holes=23, bbox=[0,6,21,26], pixels=363 in all inputs) and new Green components (variable bboxes in y=6-26, total pixels varying per train).
   - Interaction: New Green components are always added in middle section (y=6-26); their total pixels exactly equal the reduction in middle Maroon pixels (output Maroon pixels = 363 - sum of new Green pixels). Middle Maroon bbox and input holes remain, but output holes/pixels decrease (e.g., by 1-6 holes, 55-75 pixels).
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train (e.g., train 1: 74 Green pixels → 289 Maroon; train 3: ~73 Green pixels → 290 Maroon; exact match in all).

4. **Middle green positions influenced by top row shapes (partial/unknown mapping)**:
   - Components: Top row shapes (y=0-4; variable colors/bboxes like Red/Pink/Blue/Yellow/Dark Red, pixels 4-8, often at x=2-4/7-9/12-14/17-19) and new middle Green components (y=6-26).
   - Interaction: Positions (x-range) of new Green components consistently align with or extend from x-positions of input top row shapes (e.g., left top shapes at x=2-9 correlate with left Greens at x=1-10; right top at x=17-19 with right Greens at x=16-20). Total Green pixels conserved as above (see #3). Exact shape/holes/pixel distribution per Green is unknown (varies; e.g., one big Green in train 1 vs. multiple small in train 3).
   - Consistency: Top-to-middle positional correlation in x (left/mid/right) across all trains; no y-mapping or color-specific triggers identifiable as consistent in every case.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 09:14:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring a Python program with a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like shapes or patterns) to generate correct outputs matching puzzle rules, such as identifying or transforming objects in the grid. The goal is to pass multiple training examples and a test input by producing accurate results without errors in code structure or logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive) that takes appropriate inputs (e.g., a grid as List[List[int]]) and returns the expected output; missing this leads to immediate failure across all evaluations.
 * Puzzle likely involves extracting and analyzing visual objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, holes, or connected components) from the grid, applying rules like counting features, matching patterns, or omitting invalid elements.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, varying grid sizes, or specific object properties (e.g., hole counts, connectivity); ensure the function handles empty grids, single-cell objects, or non-integer grid values if applicable.
 * Outputs must precisely match expected formats (e.g., strings, numbers, or modified grids); partial matches or formatting issues could fail even if logic is partially correct.
 * Consider performance for larger grids, but prioritize correctness; avoid hardcoding for specific examples to generalize across training and test cases.
 * All considerations from attempts: Basic code structure is foundational—without 'program', no logic can be tested; future attempts must include extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding connected components via flood fill) and rule application (e.g., filtering by properties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified yet, as the previous attempt lacked any functional code.
# Future attempts should include something like this for object extraction (example structure):
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Use flood fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (e.g., blobs of same value).
    # Return list of dicts with properties like {'position': (x,y), 'size': n, 'holes': count_holes(...)}
    pass
```

```python
# Example for hole counting in an object (subtle: assumes binary grid where 0s are background/holes).
def count_holes(component: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Implement boundary tracing or separate flood fill for enclosed 0-regions.
    # Return number of distinct hole areas.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (training examples 1-5 and test) failed identically due to missing 'program' function, resulting in structural errors rather than logical ones—no code was executed or evaluated for puzzle rules.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated beyond errors, so no progress on visual puzzle solving (e.g., no object extraction, rule application, or grid processing occurred).
 * What didn't work: Complete absence of required function signature prevented any testing of puzzle logic; this indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the submission format (must be a valid Python module with 'program' def).
 * No helpful functions were present or tested; any prior unhelpful code (e.g., standalone scripts without 'program') is broken for this setup and should not be reused—focus on modular functions that can be called within 'program'.
 * Missed basic requirement: Code must be importable and executable as a module; subtle formatting like indentation or syntax errors could compound issues, but here it's purely structural.
 * Train examples all errored uniformly, suggesting the attempt was a single invalid program applied to all—no variation or learning from examples was possible.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates a complete failure to meet the basic code requirement, preventing any puzzle-specific output (e.g., no processed grid, object summary, or rule-based result).
 * Expected test output should be a valid result based on mentally simulating puzzle rules on the test grid (e.g., if rules involve counting connected shapes or holes, output might be a number/string like "3 objects with 1 hole"; but without 'program', this can't be generated or verified).
 * The error differs from expectations because no puzzle logic ran—it's structurally invalid, not a mismatch in puzzle solving (e.g., wrong count or omitted object); this blocks handling test-specific subtleties like unique grid patterns or edge cases.
 * To handle the test case, ensure 'program' processes the input grid correctly (e.g., extract objects, apply rules like omitting those without holes if that's a rule—unknown without more details, but must generalize).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based visual filling puzzle (similar to a nonogram or region-coloring challenge) on a 30x22 grid, where fixed digits (0-9 except 8) act as clues in specific "clue bands" or regions to determine how to fill blank cells (8's) with either 2 (likely one color, e.g., red) or 3 (another color, e.g., blue). The goal is to propagate fills based on detected patterns of these digits across horizontal/vertical bands, ensuring consistent region completion without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Scans top band for any 0 (triggers top/mid fills)

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Pairs with zero_top for top fill=3, bottom=3

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all-0 in left for horizontal left fill

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers vertical mid and blocks some lower fills

def has_seven_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15))  # Enables middle band right fill (cols 11-20)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(set(non_eight)) == 1 and non_eight and non_eight[0] == 9  # Strict: all non-8 must be 9 for vertical far fill

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper left vertical (rows 7-12, cols 1-6)

# Aggregator for 2's in upper band (useful for lower middle fill condition)
def any_two_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any_two_left(g) or any_two_mid(g) or any_two_right(g) or any_two_far(g)

def any_four_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 4 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers lower left vertical (rows 18-23, cols 1-6)

def is_full_block_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) == 9 and len(set(non_eight)) <= 1  # Full 3x3 non-8 block in left blocks lower middle row 22
```

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a grid with predefined borders (e.g., rows of 3s and 6s) and clue areas (numbers 0-9 in rows 1-3 and a bottom clue row), where the goal is to fill unknown cells (8s) with 3s in specific regions (upper, middle, lower sections divided into left/mid/right/far columns) based on conditional rules derived from the clues, such as presence or patterns of certain digits triggering fills in rectangular or shaped areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed borders: top and bottom rows are often filled with 3s; a row of 6s appears consistently around row 5 (0-indexed); side borders are 8s that may remain unfilled or get partial 3s based on conditions.
 * Clues are in rows 1-3 (columns 2-21, grouped into left:2-5, mid:7-10, right:12-15, far:17-20) and a bottom clue row (row 29?); conditions check for any/all specific digits (e.g., any 0 or 1 in top clues triggers top fills; full zeros in left triggers middle-left fill).
 * Regions to fill are vertically/horizontally divided: upper (rows 7-11), middle (12-17), lower (18-26?); subregions like left (cols 1-6), mid (6-11), right (11-16), far (16-21); fills are rectangular blocks of 3s but sometimes shaped (e.g., specific positions for 'nine' in far right).
 * Subtleties: Fills can extend vertically across sections (e.g., long mid from 8-27 if conditions met); some fills depend on negatives (e.g., not has_one_mid); is_nine_right checks for non-8s being all 9s, but may overfill or underfill shapes; bottom row fill color (2 or 3) depends on top conditions, but often mismatches expected.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs leave large areas of 8s unfilled (e.g., row 17 in training 1 is all 8s in expected but filled with 3s in generated); upper left has specific non-rectangular patterns (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with gaps); far right 'nine' shape is irregular (specific positions like (18,16),(18,18), etc.); interactions between clues (e.g., zero_top + one_top + not full_zero_left for upper mid).
 * All attempts fill too many 8s into 3s in places where expected leaves 8s (overfilling blocks); bottom row sometimes uses wrong color (3 vs expected 2? but not shown); no handling for cases where clues like 7/9/6 trigger partial shapes vs full blocks.
 * Grid dimensions: ~30 rows x 22 cols; indices start from 0, but clues in rows 1-3; fills avoid borders (col 0/21 often 8 or 3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top clues; useful for triggering top/bottom fills

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks if left clue block is entirely 0s; key for conditional left fills

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return bool(non_eight) and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Detects if right clue is purely 9s (ignoring 8s); triggers shaped far fills

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Presence check for 2 in left; triggers specific upper left pattern
```
These functions correctly detect clue conditions and are reusable; no types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall program structure calls fill functions in sequence on a copy of g, replacing 8s with 3s based on clue checks; this works for top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0/4/29 filled correctly in training 1) and some rectangular blocks (e.g., middle right if has_seven_right), but overfills (e.g., fills long_mid even when not extending fully).
 * Training 1: Generated fills row 17 (middle lower?) with all 3s, but expected leaves it all 8s; also fills upper far with 3s via is_nine_right, but expected has no such fill in rows 8-11 cols 16-21 (mismatch in far right extension); bottom row correct as 3s, but lower left-mid overfills cols 1-11 row 18-21 where expected has 8s in row 17.
 * Training 2: Generated fills upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 with 3s, but expected leaves row 7 cols 6-11 as 8s (partial overfill); middle left/right/far underfilled (e.g., row 13 cols 1-6 expected 3s but generated 8s? Wait, generated has 3s in some but not consistently); bottom row as 3s but expected may imply 2 (not shown, unknown); also fills row 11 cols 6-11 with 3s unexpectedly.
 * Training 3: Top clues not triggering top 3s (generated starts with 8s in row 0, expected 8s—correct); but overfills upper left rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with full 3s, expected has gaps/partial in row 8; middle section rows 12-17 mostly 8s but expected fills row 17 cols 1-6/16-21 with 3s (underfill); lower far rows 22-26 overfills with 3s via fill_lower_far_two, but expected has shaped 3s only in specific cols.
 * Training 4: Top not filled (correct, starts 8s); middle rows 12-17 overfills cols 1-6 and 11-16 with 3s via fill_middle_left/right, but expected leaves row 17 cols 6-11/16-21 as 8s; lower mid row 18 underfills (generated 8s in cols 1-5, expected 3s?); bottom row 2s correct? but generated has 6s row 5 correct.
 * Training 5: Top filled with 3s unexpectedly (generated row 0 3s, expected 8s—overfill); upper right overfills cols 16-20 rows 8-11 with 3s, expected partial; middle far underfills rows 12-17 cols 16-21 (8s, expected 3s in some); lower left-mid fills row 18 cols 1-11 with 3s correctly? but row 19 cols 16-20 mismatched (generated 3s in gaps).
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: fill_upper_left_specific (hardcodes positions but overfills gaps, e.g., row 8 cols 2/4 as 3s when expected 8s in some cases); fill_lower_far_nine (specific positions but applies unconditionally if is_nine_right, leading to mismatches like filling (18,17) which may not be expected); fill_long_mid (extends too far, e.g., to row 26 when expected stops at 17); fill_bottom (uses 3 always if top conditions, but some expected bottoms are 2s or unfilled—broken logic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills top rows 0-4 with 3s (expected likely 8s based on training 3/4/5 patterns where top clues like 0/1/9 don't always trigger full top fill); upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 filled fully with 3s, but likely partial or none needed (similar to training 2 underfill issue); middle rows 12-17 cols 1-6 filled but row 12 cols 6-11/16-21 left 8s (underfill, expected shaped based on bottom clues 0/6?); lower far rows 22-26 has partial 3s in cols 16-21 but gaps like row 22 col 17=8 (mismatch, looks like incomplete 'nine' shape); bottom row 29 not shown but implied 3s, may be wrong if test clues suggest 2; overall, too many 3s in left/mid, leaving right/far inconsistent—does not make sense as it ignores negative conditions (e.g., not full_zero_left) and shaped fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where fixed digits (0-9, 6's on certain rows) provide clues to fill blank spaces (8's) with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on pattern-matching conditions derived from the positions and combinations of those digits; the goal is to replicate exact expected fillings across training examples, likely simulating rules for shading or completing a hidden image/diagram without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are often fully filled with 3's or 2's based on top/bottom conditions; row 5 and 29 are always 6's; rows 6-7 and some lower rows start as 8's but may get filled; the puzzle divides into vertical sections (left: cols 1-6, mid: 6-11, right: 11-21) and horizontal bands (upper: rows 8-12, middle: 12-18/23, lower: 18-28).
 * Filling only occurs where 8's exist—never overwrite non-8 cells; use value 3 for fills, but some conditions lead to 2's (e.g., bottom if no zero/one top).
 * Conditions are conditional and sometimes mutually exclusive: e.g., long vertical mid fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if one in mid AND two far-right; upper far-right fill if mostly 9's in right (not all 8's); bottom far if two far AND no one mid.
 * Subtle overlaps/conflicts: multiple fills can overlap (e.g., middle mid and long mid both target mid section, but order matters to avoid partial fills); some regions like lower left-mid (rows 17-23, cols 1-11) only if four in mid, but this may conflict with other middle fills.
 * Digit detection is row-restricted (e.g., tops in rows 1-4, cols 0-22; mid in rows 1-4, cols 7-11; left in cols 2-5/6; right in cols 12-16/17-21); "full zero left" requires ALL zeros in a subregion, while others are "any" (existence).
 * Easy to miss: "is_nine_right" checks for non-8 cells in right being ALL 9's (not just any 9); no fill if condition partial (e.g., mixed 7/8/9 in right doesn't trigger nine fill); bottom row fill to 2's if no zero AND one top; some examples have pre-filled 3's outside 8's, so program must copy input faithfully.
 * Across attempts: order of fill functions matters (early fills like top/bottom set global, later ones like middle may depend); unhandled cases like pre-existing 3's in input (e.g., training 3 has them in row 7) can cause mismatches if not copied; right section fills are tricky (e.g., seven_right any 7 triggers wide middle right, but nine_right needs purity).
 * General: Puzzle emphasizes precision—small mismatches (e.g., one cell wrong) fail the example; test cases vary in digit placements, so rules must generalize without hardcoding per-example.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 17 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (middle left over-filled, likely due to full_zero_left triggering despite context); also filled row 28-29 with 3's but expected 2's in some spots? Wait, actually bottoms match, but row 17 mismatch suggests middle_left fill ignores upper/middle interactions; subtle: expected has 8's in row 17 left, so condition like full_zero_left may be too broad or misranged (cols 2-5 vs 1-6).
 * Training example 2 CORRECT: All fills matched exactly, indicating core top/bottom, upper left (if two left), long mid (if one mid + two far), upper far (if nine right), middle sections, lower left-mid (if four mid), lower mid (if two mid), and lower far (if two far no one mid) worked perfectly here—likely because this example had clean, non-overlapping conditions without pre-filled 3's.
 * Training example 3 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 7 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (upper left triggered wrongly? Input has no two left in rows 1-4? Wait, input row 1-3 have 2's in left, but perhaps range issue); also row 23 (cols 1-6) filled with 3's expected 8's (lower left overreach); row 24 has extra 3's in right where expected 8's (long mid or middle right spillover); bottom rows 30-31 are 2's matching, but upper/middle mismatches suggest mishandling pre-existing 3's in row 7 or incorrect any_two_left detection.
 * Training example 4 INCORRECT: Generated row 17 (cols 1-6 and 6-11) filled with 3's where expected 8's in left-mid (middle left/mid triggered wrongly, perhaps full_zero_left false but still filled? Input has zeros left but not full; also row 18 over-filled); row 22-23 have partial 3's in left where expected 8's (lower left-mid if four mid, but input has no 4 mid? Mismatch unknown); row 24 empty matching, but middle sections differ by entire bands.
 * Training example 5 INCORRECT: Generated row 7 all 8's matching, but row 8 right has 3's interspersed (e.g., col 16-21) where expected none (upper far triggered wrongly—input has 9's in right but mixed with 3's? is_nine_right fails purity); row 12 filled left-mid with 3's expected 8's (middle left/mid over); row 17-18 filled with 3's expected partial; row 23 right has 3's where expected 8's (lower far triggered despite one mid present?); bottoms 3's but input suggests 2's possible.
 * Overall: Works for clean cases (ex 2) but fails on overlaps/pre-fills (ex 3-5) and strict conditions (ex 1,4); fill order helps but misses exclusions (e.g., don't fill if region already partial); no extraction of full objects, but detection funcs are solid—unhelpful: none really broken, but is_nine_right too narrow (cols 12-16 only, misses far-right 17-21); full_zero_left range (2-5) may need tweak to 1-6 for some.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-fills row 7 (cols 6-11) with 3's where likely expected 8's (long mid triggered, but input has one mid in rows 1-4 cols 7-11, yet two far present—condition may need stricter check); row 8-11 left/mid/right have 3's interspersed (e.g., cols 1-6,6-11,16-21) matching some upper fills, but cols 12-16 empty where seven_right absent (no 7's, correct no fill); row 12 left empty but mid empty (middle mid if one mid, but perhaps blocked by long mid?); row 17-18 over-filled mid/right with 3's expected partial/empty (middle right if seven, but no 7); row 22-23 left-mid filled if four mid (input has 4's in rows 18-20? Wait, clues in 1-4, but lower detect any_four_mid); row 24-27 right has 3's in cols 16-21 expected empty (lower far if two far no one mid, but one mid present); bottoms 3's due to zero/one top present, seems correct; overall, too many 3's in middle/lower, suggesting program fills without checking for pre-3's or condition negations, and test likely expects sparser fills like training 3/4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 30x22 grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 represent colors, with 8 as background and 3 as green highlight), where the top 5 rows contain a key pattern embedded in 8's, and the goal is to conditionally highlight (fill non-8 cells or backgrounds with 3) matching or similar patterns in designated middle sections (e.g., rows 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27) while setting the bottom 2 rows (28-29) to all 3's or 2's based on whether the top pattern meets a specific criterion (likely exactly 84 eights in the top 5 rows x 22 columns = 110 cells, implying 26 patterned cells). Other rows like dividers (all 6's in row 5, all 8's in some separators) remain unchanged, and the highlighting preserves the internal pattern colors while replacing surrounding 8's with 3's to "frame" or emphasize matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top 5 rows (0-4) serve as a key: if they contain exactly 84 eights (measured before any modifications), trigger green (3) filling in the top itself (replacing 8's but preserving non-8 pattern cells) and in matching middle sections; otherwise, leave the top unchanged and selectively green-fill only lower sections that match the key pattern independently.
 * Middle sections are bounded by all-8 or all-6 rows (e.g., rows 6-7 all 8's as separator, row 11 all 8's, row 17 all 8's, row 21-22 all 8's); green-filling typically replaces 8's in columns 1-20 (leaving border 8's in columns 0 and 21 intact) within pattern areas of rows like 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27, but only for sections whose internal non-8 patterns mirror the top key's shape/structure (e.g., blob-like clusters of 0's, 1's, etc., in similar positions).
 * Bottom rows (28-29) are set to all 3's if the top condition is met (indicating "match found" or "key valid"), otherwise all 2's; this acts as an indicator strip.
 * Subtleties: Patterns are not always fully symmetric or identical—matching may be based on shape topology (e.g., connected components, hole counts, or bounding boxes) rather than exact cell values; in some cases (e.g., train 3,5), top is not green-filled even if patterns exist, suggesting the 84-eight rule applies only to specific key types, while lower sections can be filled independently if they "match" the top regardless of count. Dividers (row 5 all 6's) and separator rows must remain untouched. Borders (columns 0,21) often stay 8 in filled sections for framing. Count eights only in top rows 0-4, columns 0-21, before any changes to avoid state mutation issues.
 * Easy-to-miss: Green-filling in middles is selective per section (e.g., in train 2, only columns 6-10 in rows 7-11 and 23-27 get 3's around a partial match; in train 1, full sections 12-16 filled); not all 8's in a section are replaced—only those surrounding patterns that match the key. In cases like train 3/4/5, top patterns vary (e.g., all-8 top in train 3 means no top fill, but lower matches trigger isolated fills). Internal pattern colors (e.g., 0,1,2,4,6,7,9) must be preserved, not overwritten. The puzzle may involve extracting "objects" (connected non-8 regions) to compare shapes across sections.
 * All rows not mentioned (e.g., 26-27 in some) may need conditional filling based on pattern similarity; test input has a unique top pattern (0's in col 2-4 row1-3, 1's in col7-9/7 row1-3, etc.), suggesting partial matches in lower sections like rows 18-20 or 23-25.

    return key_pattern.shape_hash == section_pattern.shape_hash
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single program attempt across all training examples failed entirely (all marked INCORRECT), primarily due to execution order: greenify_top_if_condition modifies the top (replacing 8's with 3's) before subsequent functions like set_bottom_based_on_top_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition check count_eights_in_top == 84, causing the count to drop below 84 post-modification, so bottom stays 2's (expected 3's in train 1/2) and middles remain unfilled (e.g., row 12 all 8's instead of bordered 3's in train 1).
 * Top greenification worked partially in train 1/2 (correctly replaced 8's with 3's while preserving patterns in rows 0-4), but failed in train 3/4/5 where top should remain unchanged (generated filled with 3's around patterns, but expected keeps original 8-background patterns without 3's, e.g., row 0 all 8's in train 3).
 * Middle filling (rows 12-17, cols 1-20) never triggered due to the mutated count, so sections like rows 12-16 stayed all 8's or original in all trains (e.g., train 1 expected bordered 3's with preserved 7/1/6/0 patterns, but generated all 8's; train 2 expected partial 3's in cols 6-10 rows 7-11/23-27, but generated unchanged).
 * Bottom setting always defaulted to 2's due to failed condition (e.g., train 1/2 expected all 3's, but generated all 2's; train 3/4/5 expected all 2's? but generated all 2's correctly by accident, though other parts wrong).
 * copy_pink_rows was a no-op (just returns copy), unhelpful and irrelevant (no "pink" mentioned, likely a red herring or broken remnant).
 * greenify_top_if_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition are partially helpful for the filling logic (preserve non-8's, target specific ranges), but broken by not checking condition before modification and lacking pattern matching— they blindly fill all 8's in ranges if condition met, missing selective section-based matching (e.g., train 2 only fills specific columns, not full range).
 * set_bottom_based_on_top_condition is conceptually useful for the indicator but broken by post-modification check; should check original input count.
 * No pattern extraction or matching implemented, leading to over-generalized filling (e.g., train 3 generated top/middle 3's incorrectly, ignoring that top didn't qualify for 84 eights); count_eights_in_top is helpful but must be called on original grid copy.
 * Train 1: Top correct, but middle unfilled (row 12 all 8's vs expected 8-3's-8), bottom 2's vs 3's; patterns in rows 13-15 expected preserved in 3-background but generated unchanged 8's.
 * Train 2: Top correct, but no 3's in rows 7-11/23-27 cols 6-10 (generated unchanged vs expected 3's around partial matches), bottom 2's vs 3's; also missed green in row 7 cols 6-10.
 * Train 3: Top incorrectly green-filled (generated 3's around patterns in rows 0-4 vs expected original 8-background), no selective lower fills (e.g., expected 3's in rows 7-11 cols 2-5/7-10? but generated unchanged); bottom correct by default but overall mismatch.
 * Train 4: Top unchanged correctly (but expected green? wait, no—generated top original, but expected some 3's in row 12-16; actually mismatched as middle unfilled vs expected bordered 3's).
 * Train 5: Top unchanged but expected partial 3's in lower sections (generated no changes vs expected 3's in rows 7-11/17-21 cols 16-20?); patterns mismatched for unknown reason (e.g., row 8 col 16-20 expected 3's around 9's but generated 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output makes no changes to the input grid (top rows 0-4 remain 8-background with patterns like 0's/1's/9's/2's unchanged, no 3's anywhere, bottom all 2's), which does not look correct because the top pattern (e.g., 0's in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, 1's in row 1 cols 7-9 and row 3 cols 7-9, etc.) likely qualifies as a valid key (count 8's to check ~84?), so expected top green-fill (3's replacing 8's around patterns), selective middle green-fills in matching sections (e.g., rows 12-16 or 18-20 may have similar 1/0/6/0 clusters needing 3-borders), and bottom all 3's; instead, it's entirely static, suggesting the condition failed entirely (possibly top count !=84, or order bug prevented any action).
 * No green highlighting in any middle sections (e.g., rows 13-15 have 7/1/6/0 patterns unchanged vs likely expected 3's bordering them if matching top), and bottom 2's vs probable 3's; this ignores potential partial matches (e.g., the 2/0/7/9 in rows 8-10 may not match, but 4/2/5/1 in 18-20 or 9/6/4/2 in 23-25 might).
 * Overall, test output looks incorrect as it treats the grid as "no matches" despite visible similar blob shapes (e.g., triple 0's/1's in top mirroring lower 7's/1's), failing to demonstrate any understanding of selective filling—needs pattern extraction to confirm matches before filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) where cells contain color codes (integers like 0 for empty, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc., up to 9) and 8 as a placeholder to be filled based on patterns or rules derived from the top section of the grid (roughly rows 0-4). The goal is to fill 8's in specific regions of the middle section (rows ~7-27) with 3 (green) according to structural or conditional rules (e.g., based on top colors, zero counts, or special configurations), while setting the bottom two rows (28-29) to either all 3 (green) or all 2 (red) depending on whether the top qualifies as "special." Fixed rows like 5 and 25 are all 6's (possibly a separator or background), and edges are often 8's that may or may not get filled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top section (rows 0-4) determines overall behavior: count of 8's in rows 0-4 (special if exactly 84), count of 0's in rows 1-3 (e.g., ==9 triggers specific fills), and set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3 (e.g., {2,4} or {1,9} triggers region-specific fills).
 * Bottom rows 28-29 are uniformly set to 3 if top is special (fill_top_with_green also applies), else to 2; this is consistent across examples but overrides other logic.
 * Middle fills target 8's only, preserving existing colors/0's; regions include vertical strips (e.g., cols 6-10 rows 7-17), partial rows (e.g., row 12 and 16 cols 1-20, with specific cols in 13-15), and "train"-like areas (e.g., left/bottom-right blobs filled conditionally).
 * Subtleties: Fills are not global—e.g., fill_full_second fills rows 12-17 cols 1-20 completely if conditions met, but fill_partial_second is more selective (top/bottom of that block + specific cols); vertical_middle is a narrow strip; train3_regions fills three disconnected areas (left upper, bottom-left middle, bottom-right lower); train5_regions fills two vertical-ish areas. Existing non-8 cells (e.g., 0's, colors) block or pattern-match fills.
 * Easy to miss: Top colors exclude 0/8 but include scattered non-8's that form patterns (e.g., blobs of 1's, 2's); zeros==9 suggests a specific sparse top pattern. Special check is row-limited (only top 5 rows, all cols). Edges (col 0/21) often remain 8 or get partial fills. Fixed rows (5,25 all 6's; sometimes top/bottom all 8's or 3's) must not be altered. Bottom green requires special=true, but red is default.
 * Across attempts: Program applies fills sequentially but conditionally (if special then green bottom + top fill, else red bottom); then nested ifs for middle based on zeros/special/colors, with else fallback to partial_second. This works for ex1 but overfills or underfills regions in others (e.g., filling where expected is 8 or different color). No rotation/flipping; assumes grid is oriented with patterns like "trains" or blobs in fixed positions.
 * Considerations: Patterns in top/middle suggest object detection (e.g., connected components of same color), but current code uses hardcoded regions—may miss dynamic shapes. 8's are fillers, but some expected outputs leave 8's unfilled (e.g., ex3 top is all 8's, not filled). Bottom red in ex3/4/5 but generated green in some. Test input has mixed top (0's and colors like 1,9,2), suggesting partial_second or train logic, but generated fills middle with green in wrong spots.

```
Note: No object extraction function present; hardcoded regions work for ex1 but fail dynamically. set_bottom_green/red are simple but essential for bottom uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Ex1 correct: Likely matched special or zeros==9 with full fills, producing exact green regions and bottom green; top fill and middle logic aligned perfectly (no differences noted).
 * Ex2 incorrect: Generated fills rows 18-20/23-25 with green in positions like (18,6-10)=3 (but expected 8 there? Wait, expected has 3's in (18,6-10) actually—no, diff is in rows 18-20: generated has no 3's in col 6-10 for row 18-20, but expected has 3's there; also row 23-25 col 0-5/16-20 get partial green but expected full 3's in some blob shapes (e.g., expected (23,6-10)=3 but generated 8). Bottom green correct, but middle underfills "train" areas; top colors {1,2,6,9?} fallback to partial_second overfills row 12-16 selectively wrong.
 * Ex3 incorrect: Generated sets top rows 0-4 to all 3's (but expected all 8's—no fill); bottom to green (expected red); middle fills like rows 7-17 cols 6-10=3 (but expected partial or 8 in some); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; rows 23-26 cols 16-20 partial green but expected more structured (e.g., col 16-20 row 23=3 but with extensions). Overfills based on assuming special=false but colors={2,4}? Actually top has 2/4 blobs, so triggered train3 but filled wrong regions; bottom should be red since not special.
 * Ex4 incorrect: Generated fills rows 12-16 cols 0-21 with green blobs (e.g., row 12 all 3's but expected row 12 cols 6-20=3 partial); row 13-15 have 3's around existing 7/1/6/0 but expected more uniform 3's in cols 6-20; row 17 no fill (correct?); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; bottom red correct. Underfills lower middle (e.g., rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20=8 but expected some 3's); zeros in top==9? but triggered partial_second wrongly, ignoring blob shapes around 7/1/6.
 * Ex5 incorrect: Generated top rows 0-4 unchanged (correct, all 8's? No, top has 1/9 blobs, expected unchanged); but row 7 cols 6-10=3 (expected 8); row 17 cols 16-21=3 partial (expected 8); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=3 but expected 8/3 mixed; rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20 no fill but expected 3's in some; bottom red correct. Triggered train5 for {1,9} but overfills vertical middle instead of exact train5 regions; partial_second fallback wrong for scattered 1's.
 * Overall: Hardcoded regions help for static fills but miss dynamic blob extension (e.g., fill around existing colors like in ex2 expected row 18 col6-10=3 extending from top); special check works but top fill overapplies in non-special (ex3); colors set detection good but {2,4}/{1,9} triggers wrong for mixed tops; zeros==9 not handling full vs partial accurately (ex4 underfills). No function for blob detection—essential for extending fills to match shapes (e.g., connect 8's to existing colors). fill_top_with_green limited to top 5 but name/code confusing. program() copies grid correctly but sequential ifs cause fallback overfill (else: partial_second too broad).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Top rows 0-4 unchanged (has 0's and blobs of 1/9/2—correct, no full fill); but middle row 12-16 filled with full green block cols 0-21 (e.g., row 12 all 3's, but likely should be partial around existing 7/1/6/0/9); row 17 no fill (8's, possibly correct); rows 18-20 cols 0-5/11-15/21=8 but cols 6-10=8 (should extend to 3? based on ex patterns); rows 23-25 cols 0-5=8 but expected some green extension for 2-blob; bottom red (correct for non-special). Top colors ~{1,2,9}, zeros~9?, so should trigger partial_second or train mix, but generated overfills row 12-16 uniformly (ignores existing 0/7/1/6/9 shapes) and underfills lower (no train3/5 for {1,9}+2). Looks like fallback partial_second applied wrongly—missing blob-aware filling to match expected structured greens around colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle where a 30x22 grid containing numbers 0-9 (as clues or partial shapes) and 8's (blanks to be filled) must have the 8's replaced selectively with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on detecting the presence or patterns of certain numbers in predefined sub-regions (e.g., left, mid, right areas across rows). The goal is to "complete" visual elements like bars, frames, or object outlines by filling only when clues indicate a match, while leaving some 8's unfilled to preserve structure; entire rows or blocks (e.g., top/bottom) may fill with 3's or 2's conditionally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural rows: rows 0-4 and 28-29 often fill entirely with 3's (or 2's if top conditions fail), row 5 and 25-26 with 6's, row 6/7/11/12/16/17/21/22/27/28 with potential 8's or partial fills; vertical bars (e.g., col 0/21 often 8's) and horizontal dividers must not be over-filled.
 * Clues are sparse numbers in rows 1-3 (top), 8-10 (upper mid), 12-16 (lower mid), 18-20 (bottom left/mid), 23-25 (bottom right); detect "any" presence (e.g., one 0 or 1 in a column range) or "all non-8" patterns (e.g., all non-8's are 9's in a region) to trigger fills, but only fill 8's, not overwriting existing numbers.
 * Subtleties: Fills are region-specific (e.g., left: cols 1-6 or 2-5, mid: 6-11 or 7-11, right: 11-21 or 12-16/16-21); order matters (early fills like top can affect later checks); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill divider rows like 17/22 if conditions partial); "full_zero_left" requires all in range ==0, not "any"; "is_nine_right" checks non-8's are all 9's but allows 8's; bottom fills (e.g., rows 18-22) depend on combos like has_one_mid + any_two_far for tall verticals, but exclude if not full match; test cases show asymmetric patterns (e.g., 2's or 4's scattered, not uniform).
 * Easy to miss: Some regions overlap (e.g., right fills span 11-21, affecting far right); conditions like "not has_one_mid" prevent fills in alternatives; bottom rows 28-29 always 3's if top has both 0 and 1, else 2's; vertical consistency (e.g., if left has any_two, fill rows 7-12 cols 1-6); no fills in cols 0/21 or row edges if 8's there; puzzle preserves "shapes" like 7's in right or 0's in mid without overwriting.
 * All attempts consider row ranges like 7-27 for tall fills, but miss partial matches (e.g., if two_far but no one_mid, fill only subset); include checks for scattered clues (e.g., any_four_mid triggers bottom left fill); avoid filling if clue is isolated (e.g., single 2 doesn't always trigger).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown (same program for all) passed training example 2 (full logic worked for that case's clues, e.g., top 0+1 triggered full top/bottom 3's, and mid/right conditions aligned without overfill).
 * Failed training 1: Over-filled row 17 (cols 6-11 and possibly others) with 3's due to has_one_mid and any_two_far triggering tall fill range(7,27) mid, but expected keeps it 8's (likely because two_far is in bottom rows 18-22, not top rows 1-3 for the check; check ranges mismatch clue locations).
 * Failed training 3: Filled row 7 left with 3's (correct), but row 17 left/mid empty in generated vs expected filled row 17 empty but row 18 filled correctly; also bottom row 28-29 filled with 2's incorrectly (top lacked 0+1?); row 22 filled partially wrong (expected 3's in right but generated 8's); any_two_left triggered upper left but missed lower dependencies.
 * Failed training 4: Top filled correctly with 0's present, but row 17 mid filled with 3's incorrectly (expected 8's, similar to train 1 overfill); row 18 left filled but expected empty in some; bottom row 28-29 with 2's wrong (should be 3's); is_nine_right not triggered properly, leaving right partial.
 * Failed training 5: Top not filled (no 0/1 in top? generated keeps 8's row 0-4); row 8 right over-filled with 3's in col 16-20; row 17 empty correct but row 18 mid over-filled; has_one_mid triggered tall mid but expected partial (e.g., row 7 empty); bottom 28-29 with 2's wrong.
 * Conditions like any_two_far use top rows 1-3 but clues often in bottom (e.g., rows 18-22), causing false positives/negatives; full_zero_left too strict for partial 0's; no function to check bottom-specific clues (e.g., any_two in rows 18-20); fill_region helpful but ranges too broad (e.g., range(7,27) fills dividers); is_nine_right useful but range(12,16) misses far right; no extraction for full shapes (e.g., count 9's exactly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top/bottom filled with 3's correctly assuming 0+1 in top row 1-3; left/mid/right regions filled in rows 12-17 based on 7/1/0 clues; bottom rows 18-22 filled with 3's around 4/2/1/5 clues) but does not look fully correct: over-fills row 7-11 mid/right with 3's (e.g., col 6-11 in row 8 has 3's around 0's, but may encroach on upper structure; expected likely keeps some 8's for separation); row 23-27 right over-filled vertically (e.g., col 6-11 in 23-27 has 3's around 6's, but test has scattered 9's/6's/2's suggesting partial fill only); row 12 left filled but col 1-6 has 3's overwriting potential edges; differences from logic: any_two_far likely false (2's in bottom col 17-21, not checked there), yet tall mid fill happened, mismatching train 1 issue; bottom row 28-29 correct as 3's, but overall too many 3's in verticals (e.g., col 3 in rows 7-27 all 3's, likely breaks shape); does not account for no has_seven_right (9's instead), so right fill range(12,17) cols 11-21 wrong—expected partial 8's preserved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) with fixed structural elements (e.g., bands of 3s, 2s, or 6s in specific rows) and clue numbers (0,1,2,7,9) placed in certain positions, where the goal is to replace all 8s (unknown cells) with either 2 or 3 to form coherent regions or "blobs" based on positional rules and interactions between clues. The filling rules appear to propagate from clue conditions to fill rectangular regions, with 3 often indicating a "primary" or connected fill and 2 a "secondary" or default fill, while avoiding overfilling or conflicting with existing clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed bands: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are horizontal bands filled entirely with 3 or 2; row 5 and row 30 are always full 6s (perhaps dividers or walls); rows 6-7 and 25-27 often start as 8s but get partial fills.
 * Clues (0,1,2,7,9) are checked in specific subregions (e.g., "top" clues in rows 1-3, cols 0-21 for 0/1/2; "left" in cols 2-4; "mid" in cols 7-10; "right" in cols 12-15 or 16-20), and conditions like "has_zero_top" or "is_nine_right" (which requires all non-8s in a region to be 9 and at least one present) trigger fills only in 8s within target rectangles.
 * Subtleties include conditional dependencies: e.g., bottom band fills with 3 only if top clues have both 0 and 1; upper left fill extends to col 6 under specific 2 placements; long mid (rows 8-26, cols 6-10) requires both 1 in mid and 2 in far right; row 17 mid fill depends on negation (not full_zero_left); lower far has early/late variants based on 1-left vs. (2-far and not 1-mid).
 * Order of function calls in program() matters, as fills only target 8s and later fills can overwrite if regions overlap (though current code avoids this by sequential non-overlapping regions).
 * Easy-to-miss: Fills are rectangular but sometimes partial (e.g., upper left adds col 6 conditionally); "full_zero_left" requires all three cells in rows 1-3, cols 2-4 to be 0 (not any); no fills touch clue positions (preserves 0/1/2/7/9); bottom rows 28-29 default to 2 unless top condition met; some regions like middle right (rows 12-16, cols 11-20) fill broadly if 7 in right.
 * Across attempts, issues include overfilling (e.g., filling where clues block or conditions not fully met), underfilling (e.g., missing propagations to adjacent cols like 6 or 11), ignoring negations (e.g., not full_zero_left), and mishandling "is_nine_right" (fills even if mixed non-8s). Test cases highlight sensitivity to clue interactions across vertical bands (left/mid/right).
 * No rotation or symmetry assumed; all checks are absolute positions. 8s outside defined regions may remain unfilled, but expectations show all 8s filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current code uses simple any/all comprehensions for conditions, which are helpful for quick regional checks. No complex types or extractions needed yet, but potential for region-specific validators.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks entire top band for 0 (helpful for global top/bottom trigger)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Useful for strict "all clues are 9" without 8s interfering

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(r_start, r_end + 1):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Core filling tool; only targets 8s, preserves clues
```

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_upper_far` relies on `is_nine_right` which may misfire if region has 8s mixed with non-9s (it collects non-8s correctly but assumes presence implies fill—subtle bug in some cases). `fill_row17_mid` uses complex negation which failed in Train3/5. No object extraction functions present or needed; simple grid iteration suffices.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct—properly filled top/bottom bands with 3s (due to 0/1 top presence), upper/middle/lower regions with 3s based on 2-left, 1-mid, 7-right, etc.; no over/underfills observed.
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated extra 3s in row7 cols6-10 (should be 8s, as no long_mid trigger without 2-far?); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left requires full_zero_left, which isn't met); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (condition (has_one_mid and not full_zero_left) or any_two_mid not fully satisfied); row22 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (no upper_left propagation?); overall, overfilled mid/left regions without strict conditions.
 * Train3: Incorrect—underfilled row7 (expected 3s in cols1-5, but generated 8s—upper_left missed due to no 2-left? Wait, clues have 2s there); row11 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left overtriggered); row16 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle regions missed); row17 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s in cols6-10 only? No, expectations show row17 all 8s except mid 3s—generated missed mid; row18 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s initially then propagated; bottom rows 30-31 are 2s as expected but top clues lacked 0/1 pair? Major issue: left/mid fills inconsistent with negations and propagations.
 * Train4: Correct—handled complex interactions like 1-left triggering lower_far_early, 2-top for lower_mid, etc.; all regions filled precisely without extras.
 * Train5: Incorrect—row12 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_mid triggered wrongly without strict 1-mid?); row16 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle_left missed); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (row17_mid overtriggered); row21 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_left/mid missed due to no 2-left/top?); row22 all 8s but expected partial 3s in lower; overfilled some right regions with 3s where 8s expected (e.g., row8-11 cols16-20).
 * General: Conditions like full_zero_left and negations (not full_zero_left) often fail, leading to missed or extra mid fills; upper_far works when 9s present but not if mixed; long_mid undertriggers without 2-far; no function for extracting full clue regions (e.g., to validate blob shapes), which might help debug; fill order causes no overwrites but misses chained fills (e.g., upper to middle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—while top/bottom bands are properly 3s (due to 0-top and 1-top present), and some regions like upper left (rows8-11 cols1-5=3s), middle mid (rows12-16 cols6-10=3s), lower left/mid (rows18-21 cols1-5/6-10=3s) match expectations, there are mismatches: row7 cols1-5 are 8s but should be 3s (upper_left trigger from 2-left present, but code's any_two_left should catch it—possible col range issue in fill_upper_left); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but if not full_zero_left (clues show mixed 0s), expected 8s; row22 cols16-20 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_far_late should trigger from 2-far and not 1-mid? Clues have 2s far right); row24-26 cols16-20 partial 3s but code filled full, mismatching sparse 2-clue positions; overall, underfills vertical propagations (e.g., row22-26 left/mid should chain from upper) and overfills bottom mid without negation check; does not make complete sense as some 8s remain (e.g., row7, row22 partial), violating full-fill expectation, and ignores subtle extensions like col6 in upper left.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 5 train input/output pairs, below is a list of consistent interactions or connections between components. These are limited to obvious, direct relationships that appear in **every** train example (or via presence/absence across all). Only properties like color, position (bbox), pixel count, and holes are considered where they reliably influence changes. No high-level puzzle solving or irrelevant/static elements (e.g., unchanged pink lines at y=5/27, fixed small reds at y=8/10, or static lower shapes at y=18-25) are included. Unknown mappings (e.g., exact position-to-position transformations for variable greens) are noted as such rather than speculated.

1. **Top background color change triggered by specific left-top shape**:
   - Component: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[7,1,9,3], pixels=7).
   - Interaction: When present in input top row (y=0-4), changes top background Maroon (holes=4, bbox=[0,0,21,4], pixels=84) to Green (same holes, bbox, pixels).
   - Consistency: Present in trains 1-2 (change occurs); absent in trains 3-5 (no change; top stays Maroon, though pixel counts may vary slightly due to top shapes, e.g., 83/85/90).

2. **Bottom background color change triggered by same left-top shape**:
   - Component: Blue (holes=0, bbox=[7,1,9,3], pixels=7).
   - Interaction: When present in input top row (y=0-4), changes bottom background Maroon (holes=0, bbox=[0,28,21,29], pixels=44) to Green (same holes, bbox, pixels). When absent, changes to Red (same holes, bbox, pixels).
   - Consistency: Present in trains 1-2 (to Green); absent in trains 3-5 (to Red). Always a color change from Maroon in every train.

3. **Middle background pixel conservation via green addition**:
   - Components: Middle Maroon (holes=23, bbox=[0,6,21,26], pixels=363 in all inputs) and new Green components (variable bboxes in y=6-26, total pixels varying per train).
   - Interaction: New Green components are always added in middle section (y=6-26); their total pixels exactly equal the reduction in middle Maroon pixels (output Maroon pixels = 363 - sum of new Green pixels). Middle Maroon bbox and input holes remain, but output holes/pixels decrease (e.g., by 1-6 holes, 55-75 pixels).
   - Consistency: Occurs in every train (e.g., train 1: 74 Green pixels → 289 Maroon; train 3: ~73 Green pixels → 290 Maroon; exact match in all).

4. **Middle green positions influenced by top row shapes (partial/unknown mapping)**:
   - Components: Top row shapes (y=0-4; variable colors/bboxes like Red/Pink/Blue/Yellow/Dark Red, pixels 4-8, often at x=2-4/7-9/12-14/17-19) and new middle Green components (y=6-26).
   - Interaction: Positions (x-range) of new Green components consistently align with or extend from x-positions of input top row shapes (e.g., left top shapes at x=2-9 correlate with left Greens at x=1-10; right top at x=17-19 with right Greens at x=16-20). Total Green pixels conserved as above (see #3). Exact shape/holes/pixel distribution per Green is unknown (varies; e.g., one big Green in train 1 vs. multiple small in train 3).
   - Consistency: Top-to-middle positional correlation in x (left/mid/right) across all trains; no y-mapping or color-specific triggers identifiable as consistent in every case.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:22:17] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a deductive logic puzzle (possibly a variant of a battleship, nurikabe, or custom fill puzzle) where a grid contains fixed clues (numbers 0-9 representing shapes, counts, or states) and unknowns (8s to be resolved into specific numbers like 2, 3, 6 based on positional rules, band-filling logic, and conditional presence/absence of clues in designated regions). The goal of the program is to apply a sequence of rules to fill only the 8s without altering existing clues, producing a completed grid that matches the expected deductions for each training case.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 30 rows by 22 columns, with distinct bands/regions: top band (rows 0-4, clues in rows 1-3 cols 22?), middle deduction areas (rows 7-26 in sections like left/mid/right cols 1-6/6-10/11-20), bottom band (rows 28-29), and fixed full rows like row 5/25/30 all 6s, rows 0-4/28-29 often 3s.
 * Rules involve conditional rectangle fills (e.g., fill with 3 if certain clues like 0 and 1 coexist in "top" region cols 22; fill bottom with 3 if top has 0+1, else 2), but order matters—early fills can trigger later ones, and over-filling (e.g., filling non-8s or wrong regions) breaks matches.
 * Subtle clue regions: "top" clues seem in col 22 (rows 1-3), "left" in cols 2-5 (rows 1-3? but code uses 2-5), "mid" cols 7-11, "right" cols 12-16; "far" cols 17-21; avoid filling col 0/21/22 which are often boundaries (8s or fixed).
 * Presence/absence logic: e.g., "full_zero_left" requires all zeros in a subregion; "is_nine_right" checks if non-8s in right are all 9s (not just any 9); "any_two_*" detects 2s in specific zones to trigger extensions.
 * Do not fill non-8s (code has if out[r][c] == 8 check, which is good); some rules are mutually exclusive (e.g., lower far fill only if two far but no one mid).
 * Easy to miss: Top band fill is cols 0-21 (not 22); bottom is always filled but value depends on top condition; upper/middle/lower sections (rows 7-11,12-17,18-22) have parallel left/mid/right fills triggered independently; row 23-24 often untouched or partial; no fills in rows 6/23-27 except specific cases.
 * Grid has vertical/horizontal symmetry in clues but deductions are asymmetric; 3s seem to represent "filled/shaded" states, 2s "partial/empty", 6s boundaries.
 * All attempts fail due to over-filling (e.g., filling where expected is 8) or under-filling (missing triggers); code applies all rules unconditionally after checks, but some rules interact (e.g., upper mid extension only after base fills).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def full_zero_left() -> bool:
    return all(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks complete zero in left clue subregion; useful for triggering middle left fill.

def has_zero_top() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Detects 0 in top-right clue column; pairs with has_one_top for band fills.

def has_one_top() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Detects 1 in top-right; key for 3 vs 2 in bottom.

def has_one_mid() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 11))  # Mid clue detection; blocks some lower fills.

def has_seven_right() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16))  # Right clue for middle right fill.

def is_nine_right() -> bool:
    non_eight = [out[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16) if out[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Strict all-9s check (ignores 8s); useful for upper far fill.

def any_two_left() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper/lower left fills.

def any_two_far() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(17, 21))  # For upper mid extension and conditional lower far.

def any_two_top() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Triggers lower mid fill.

def fill_rect(rs: int, re: int, cs: int, ce: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(rs, re + 1):
        for c in range(cs, ce + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Safe fill-only-8s; essential to avoid overwriting clues.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core rules are incomplete or wrongly ordered; e.g., in Train 1, generated fills row 17 (0-based index 17) with 3s in cols 1-6 where expected keeps 8s (under-filled lower left? No, over-filled mid-left in row 12 where expected has 8s in some spots? Actually, Train 1 generated row 12: full 3s left-mid-right, but expected row 12 has 8s in left and partial 3s only mid-right—over-filled left).
 * Train 1 also incorrectly fills upper mid (rows 7-11 cols 6-10) with 3s due to has_one_mid() and any_two_far(), but expected has 8s there (rule triggers too early or wrongly).
 * Train 2 generated over-fills upper left (rows 7-11 cols 1-6) with 3s from any_two_left(), but expected keeps 8s; also fills bottom with 2s correctly (no 0+1 top), but middle right (rows 12-17 cols 11-20) partial 3s where expected has more 8s.
 * Train 2 mismatches lower far (rows 22-26? code has 22-26 but expected row 23 empty) by not filling due to has_one_mid() blocking, but generated has no fill there while expected has 3s in cols 6-10? Wait, unknown why—possibly rule range wrong (code uses 22-26 for far, but grid shows row 23 as 8s).
 * Train 3 generated fills bottom with 2s (correct, no top 0+1), but over-fills upper left/mid (rows 7-11) with 3s from any_two_left() and is_nine_right(), expected keeps more 8s; also fills row 17 with 3s where expected has 8s in mid.
 * Train 3 lower section (rows 18-22) over-fills left/mid with 3s, but expected row 17 empty in left; row 23 partial 3s in far but code misses (wrong row range for lower far: code 22-26 overlaps empty row 23-24).
 * Train 4 incorrectly fills top band with nothing (keeps 8s in rows 0-4), but expected has no top clues triggering 3s? Wait, input has top 0s/2s, code's has_zero_top() false? Mismatch in col 22 range; also over-fills middle left (rows 12-17 cols 1-6) with 3s from full_zero_left(), expected keeps 8s.
 * Train 4 lower left (rows 18-22 cols 1-6) filled with 3s, but expected row 17 empty; bottom 2s correct.
 * Train 5 over-fills upper (rows 7-11) empty due to no two_left, but fills middle right wrongly; lower mid (rows 18-22 cols 6-10) misses due to no two_top, expected has 3s? Also row 17 filled with 3s where expected empty.
 * Common issue: fill_rect ranges inconsistent (e.g., middle right code 11-20 too wide, expected 12-20?); top fill cols 0-21 includes boundaries; no handling for cases without full_zero_left (Train 4 has partial zeros, doesn't trigger).
 * Function full_zero_left is helpful but too strict (requires all zeros; Train 4 has partial, needs "any_zero_left"?); is_nine_right good but only triggers if no 8s mixed wrong.
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection for connected 8s), but not needed—rules are regional, not global.
 * fill_rect is essential and correct (only 8s), but unhelpful if ranges wrong (e.g., lower far 22-26 includes row 23-24 which should stay 8s).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding of band fills (top/bottom often close) but fail on sectional triggers (upper/mid/lower independence) and ranges (over-fill boundaries like col 0/21).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output fills top/bottom bands with 3s (likely from has_zero_top() and has_one_top() detecting 0 and 1 in col 22), which seems plausible if test input has those clues, but without input grid, can't confirm—however, since all trainings failed similar logic, this may over-fill if test lacks full triggers.
 * Middle sections over-filled: e.g., rows 12-17 cols 1-6/6-10/11-20 partial 3s, but based on Train 1/2 patterns, likely mismatches expected 8s in left (no full_zero_left?); upper rows 7-11 cols 1-6 filled from any_two_left(), cols 16-20 from is_nine_right()? But Train 3/4 show this over-fills.
 * Lower rows 18-22 cols 1-6/6-10 filled with 3s (from two_left and two_top?), cols 11-20 not (no seven_right?), but row 23-26 empty except possible far miss; rows 24-26 have no fills, expected likely partial 3s in mid/far per Train 3.
 * Does not look correct: Over-fills middle left (rows 12-17 cols 1-6 all 3s, but Train 1 expected 8s there without full_zero); upper mid partial 3s in cols 6-10/16-20 where Train 2 kept 8s; bottom 3s may be wrong if test top lacks 0+1 pair (Train 2 had 2s correctly). Subtleties like col 22 clues not propagating to col 0 boundaries (generated fills col 0 with 3s, but expected often 8s). Missing conditional blocks (e.g., lower far empty, but if any_two_far() and not has_one_mid(), should fill rows 22-26 cols 16-20 with 3s per code, but output shows 8s—bug in trigger?).

[2025-10-02 09:22:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:42:02] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where patterns of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors or empties) in the top panel (rows 1-3, columns 0-21) act as triggers to fill specific regions in the lower panels (rows 4-29, divided into horizontal sections like panels 2-5 and a bottom bar) with a background color (3) or other fills, while preserving or modifying certain art elements; the bottom two rows (28-29) are uniformly filled with 3 or 2 based on top conditions. The goal is to detect exact shapes like "O"s, broken shapes, or color clusters in the top and apply rule-based fills to complete the image without overwriting key elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top panel patterns must be detected precisely by position and shape: e.g., "zero left" requires 0s specifically in rows 1-3, columns 2-4 (not just any 0s); "strict blue O" needs exact 1s in columns 7-9 for rows 1 and 3, plus center at row 2 col 8, but not filling the entire O if it's not strict.
 * Fills with 3 (likely white/background) are conditional and sectional: top full fill only if zero_left AND strict_blue_o; vertical non-blue fills propagate top colors down only if row 2 is 8 and row 3 matches top; third panel (rows 12-16?) fills columns 1-5, 6-10 (if blue O), 11-20 (if seven middle); second/fourth panels (rows 7-11, 18-21) get full middle fills (cols 6-10) only if pink O top (specific 6s and 8s in cols 12-14 rows 1-3).
 * Art-specific fills are hardcoded and fragile: left red (2s in top left) triggers exact pixel fills in second/fourth left panels (cols 1-5, specific positions like row 8 cols 1,3,5=3); lightblue middle (9s with 8s in cols 12-14) fills right second panel gaps; yellow broken O (4s with 8s in cols 7-9) fills fourth middle gaps (cols 6-10 bottom rows).
 * Bottom fill (rows 28-29): 3 only if zero_left AND strict_blue_o, else 2 (darker background?); entire grid starts as copy, only overwrite 8s (blanks?) to 3.
 * Subtleties: Patterns like pink O include internal 8s (holes?) at specific spots (row2 col13=8, row3 col13=8); lightblue has mixed 9/8; yellow has broken top with 8 in middle. Overfills happen if conditions overlap without checks (e.g., filling art areas prematurely). No overwriting of non-8 cells. Grid dimensions: 30 rows x 22 cols, with horizontal dividers (all 6s or 3s in rows 0,4,5,25?,28-29; all 8s in some). Panels seem divided: top (0-4), then sections ~6-11,12-16,17-21,22-27? with vertical-ish columns (left 0-5, middle 6-10, right 11-15/16-20?).
 * Easy to miss: Third panel background fill uses set of columns (1-5 +11-20 if seven, +6-10 if blue O), applied to rows 12-16 only if 8; vertical top fills (rows 1-3 only?) skip blues (1s). No fills in row 22-27 except possibly bottom of fourth panel. Conditions are AND for some (e.g., top full), but independent for others. 0s are empties/holes, not to fill. Right fills (e.g., lightblue) are sparse, not full blocks.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The detection functions in the program are helpful for pattern recognition, as they isolate top triggers cleanly:

```python
def has_zero_left(out) -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))

def has_strict_blue_o(out) -> bool:
    return (all(out[1][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)) and
            all(out[3][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)) and
            out[2][8] == 1)

def has_seven_middle(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][12] == 7 and all(out[2][c] == 7 for c in range(12, 15)) and
            out[3][12] == 7)

def has_pink_o_top(out) -> bool:
    return (all(out[1][c] == 6 for c in range(12, 15)) and
            out[2][12] == 6 and out[2][14] == 6 and
            out[3][12] == 6 and out[3][14] == 6 and
            out[2][13] == 8 and out[3][13] == 8)

def has_red_left(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][2] == 2 and out[1][4] == 2 and
            out[2][3] == 2 and
            out[3][2] == 2 and out[3][4] == 2)

def has_lightblue_middle(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][12] == 9 and out[1][14] == 9 and out[1][13] == 8 and
            out[2][12] == 9 and out[2][13] -> 9 and out[2][14] == 8 and
            all(out[3][c] == 9 for c in range(12, 15)))

def has_yellow_broken_o(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][7] == 4 and out[1][8] == 8 and out[1][9] == 4 and
            out[2][7] == 4 and out[2][8] == 8 and out[2][9] == 4 and
            all(out[3][c] == 4 for c in range(7, 10)))
```

No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no general blob finder); the hardcoded detectors work for known patterns but miss variations. Column set for third panel fill is useful for modular fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, so core structure (copy grid, detect top patterns, conditional 3-fills on 8s, bottom uniform fill) works when zero_left + blue O trigger top/full fills and basic verticals.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated misses 3-fills in second panel top (row 7 cols 6-10 all 8s instead of 3s), third panel left/right (rows 12-16 cols 1-5/11-20 partial 3s missing), fourth panel middle full (rows 18-21 cols 6-10 has some 3s but incomplete vs expected), and bottom is 3s (correct? but expected has more 3s in panels); overfills nothing obvious, but underfills backgrounds where pink O should trigger second/fourth middles fully.
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated has wrong top fill (row 1 has 3,2,3 patterns instead of 8s), second panel left overfilled with 3s in cols 1-5 rows 7-11 (expected partial 3s only in row 7), third panel no fills (all 8s in cols 1-10/11-20 rows 12-16, expected 3s), fourth left overfilled similarly, bottom 2s (correct, since no zero_left/blue O); misses red left trigger for sparse art fills, applies full blocks instead.
 * Training 4: Incorrect; generated has third panel overfilled (rows 12-17 cols 0-5/11-21 all 3s, but expected only cols 1-5 partial and middle empty), fourth panel top row 17 all 8s (expected 3s in cols 6-10), pink O detection likely failed (no full middle fills in second/fourth), lightblue right fills missing (row 8-10 cols 16-20 partial 8s vs expected 3s); bottom 2s correct.
 * Training 5: Incorrect; generated misses all panel backgrounds (rows 7-11/12-16/17-21/22-27 all 8s except sparse, expected 3s in left/middle/right sections per triggers like blue O/seven/pink), no art fills (e.g., row 8 cols 17-21 8s vs expected 3s for lightblue), top patterns not triggering (e.g., strict blue O failed? since row 7 cols 6-10 8s); bottom 2s correct (no zero_left).
 * Vertical non-blue fill in top works in some (e.g., training 2 row 2 col 2=0 preserved), but not applied consistently.
 * Hardcoded art fills (e.g., for red left) are position-specific and work only if exact top red matches, but over-applied in training 3/4 without conditions.
 * has_lightblue_middle has a typo (out[2][13] == 9? but code says 9, expected may need 8); not triggered in most.
 * Full top fill (rows 0-4 all 3 on 8s) only if both zero_left AND blue_o, missed in training 3/5.
 * No general object extractor; hardcoded detectors are helpful but brittle for variations (e.g., broken O positions exact).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it resembles training 5's errors: no background 3-fills in any lower panels (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 6-10 all 8s, but top has blue O-ish 1s in cols 7-9 and zero left 0s in cols 2-4, so should trigger top full fill (rows 0-4 cols all to 3 on 8s) and third panel middles (cols 6-10 rows 12-16 to 3), plus bottom to 3s; instead bottom is 2s (wrong, since zero_left true and blue_o partial but strict check likely failed due to row 2 cols 7/9=1? wait, test top row2: 1,1,8? no, cols7-9 row2=1,1,8? output shows row1 (second list):1,8,1? wait, [8,8,0,0,0,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] so row1 cols7-9:1,8,1 (not all 1s), row2:1,1,8 (not 3,1,3 or strict), row3:1,8,1; so strict_blue_o false (needs all 1s in sides + center 1), zero_left true, so no top full, no bottom 3 (correctly 2), but misses other triggers like pink? top cols12-14: row1 9,8,9; row2 9,9,3 (not 6s/8s); seven? no; red left? row1 cols2/4=0 not 2; lightblue partial but not exact (row1 col13=8 ok, but row2 col14=3 not 8); yellow? cols7-9 row1:1,8,1 not 4,8,4. So minimal triggers, but generated still has no fills where vertical non-blue should apply (e.g., row2 col18-19=2,2 but if top row1 col18=2, row3=2? test row3 cols18-20=2,2,2, row2=2,3,2 so partial), and third panel empty (should fill cols1-5/11-20 if seven, but no seven). Overall, underfills everything, preserving too many 8s; expected likely has some 3s in left/right thirds per rules, and test fails strict detections leading to blank panels.

[2025-10-02 09:42:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 09:55:14] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where specific colored shapes or patterns (represented by numbers like 1 for blue, 2 for red, 6 for pink, etc.) trigger conditional filling of blank spaces (8s) with a fill color (3, possibly green or neutral). The program processes the grid top-to-bottom, detecting patterns in upper, middle, and lower sections to apply fills in targeted areas, simulating rules like object recognition and propagation of fills based on presence/absence of shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 24-29 often contain full lines of 3s or 6s/bottom fills (e.g., bottom two rows always filled with 2 or 3 based on top patterns); rows 5-6 and 25? are full 6s; many rows have 8s as blanks to fill only conditionally.
 * Pattern detection is localized: e.g., upper section (rows 1-3, cols 7-9 for "blue H" as [1,1,1]/[8,1,8]/[1,1,1]); middle sections have U/C shapes in cols 1-20, rows 7-11 or 12-16; lower sections (rows 17-21) have bowtie/partial fills triggered by red (2) or lightblue (9) presences.
 * Fills are selective: Only replace 8s with 3s in specific positions (e.g., full rows, sides, partial shapes); never overwrite non-8s; order matters (top fills first, then middle, then lower).
 * Subtleties: "Top filled" (blue H) changes bottom color from 2 to 3 and enables broader fills; left 0s (blanks?) in rows 1-3 cols 2-4 trigger partial lower fills only if not full; red presence anywhere in certain col ranges triggers "red fills" but varies by top_filled state; lightblue C enables right-side partials; blue in middle-left (any 1 in rows 1-4? cols 7-9) triggers middle fills.
 * Easy to miss: Fills can overlap sections (e.g., upper fills propagate to row 5? but code shows rows 0-4? wait, code has range(5) for top); not all 8s fill—e.g., row 21 fills conditionally by section (left/mid/right); row 17 red fill depends on top_filled XOR red location; full left 0s + top_filled enables huge lower fill (rows 12-16, cols 1-20); partial 0 logic is nested (any0 but not full0 fills only sides at row 14 cols 1,5).
 * Bottom fill: Always rows 28-29 with 3 if top_filled, else 2; but in ex3/4/5 generated shows 2s, expected also 2s sometimes—suggests top_filled false in those.
 * No fills in some areas: e.g., rows 7-8 often remain 8s unless upper/middle triggers; row 12 sometimes fills fully if conditions met.
 * Colors: 0=empty/white, 1=blue, 2=red, 3=fill/green?, 4=orange?, 5=yellow?, 6=pink, 7=purple?, 9=lightblue; 8=blank to fill.

These detector functions are helpful for identifying trigger patterns (e.g., shapes like H/U/C/bowtie) in specific grid regions; they return booleans for conditional logic. The main program uses them to apply targeted 3-fills on 8s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct overall—likely because it had blue H trigger (rows 1-3 cols 7-9 as [1,1,1]/[3,1,3]? wait, code fills 8s to 3 post-detect, but input had proper 1s; bottom filled 3s; middle/lower partials matched expected.
 * Training 2: Incorrect—generated has row7 cols6-10 as 3s (from pink U? but expected row7 empty 8s); row8 cols0-5 as 8s/2s but expected 3s in left (missed upper fill prop?); row11 cols6-10 as 3s but expected empty; row12 empty but expected full 3s left/mid/right?; row14 col5 as 8 but expected 3? (partial 0 logic failed); row23 full 3s but expected empty 8s; row24 has 3s in left/mid but expected full 3s everywhere? (bottom fill wrong, top_filled false but should be true?); subtle: generated row9 col2=8 expected 3 (left fill miss); unknown why row17 empty when expected empty but row18-20 partials mismatch (e.g., generated row18 col2=4 not 3).
 * Training 3: Incorrect—generated row7 empty (good) but row11 cols0-5 as 3s expected empty; row12 empty expected empty (good); row17 empty expected full left 3s? no, expected row17 empty but row18 cols0-5 as 3s/4s, generated has 3s in left but overwrote non-8s?; bottom rows 28-29=2 good, but row24 empty expected full 3s in right? wait no, expected row24 has 3s only in right cols16-20; big miss: generated no fills in row8 (expected full left 3s cols0-5); row21 cols16-20 empty expected 3s (lightblue C trigger failed); row22 empty good; unknown why row18-20 left partials have 3s on non-8s like 4s.
 * Training 4: Incorrect—generated row12 cols11-20 as 3s but expected empty 8s (overfill mid/right); row13 col11=3 expected empty; row14 cols12-13=3,6 expected 3, empty? (fill prop wrong); row15 col12=3 expected empty; row16 full 3s expected empty; row17 empty good; but row18-21 partials mismatch (e.g., generated row18 cols0-5 empty expected 3s); bottom 2s good; subtle: left 0s full but no top_filled, so partial sides only, but code overfilled mid; unknown why row13 left has 3,7,3 but expected 3s more broadly.
 * Training 5: Incorrect—generated row7 empty good but expected full 3s cols16-20 (lightblue? but input has 9s in cols12-14 rows1-3); row8 cols16-20=3s expected full 3s; row12 empty expected empty; row17 empty expected full 3s cols16-20; row18 cols16-20=3s/1s but expected empty/non-fill; big miss: no upper fills in row7-8 right (C trigger not prop to row7); row21 cols16-20 empty expected 3s; unknown why row9-11 right has 3s on 9s (overwrote colors).
 * Overall: Detectors like has_pink_u/has_red_u work for mid fills (e.g., train2 pink triggered row7 3s correctly but over-applied); has_full_left_0 good for detecting but nested logic for partial fills (if any0 and not full0) fails in train2/4 (misses side 3s); top_filled prop to bottom color works (train1=3, others=2); red bowtie/left detectors underused—train3 has bowtie but no left row21 fill?; has_red_top_* any-in-range is too broad, causes false triggers (e.g., train5 red right but no mid fill); lightblue_c detects but partial right fills miss in train3/5 (e.g., no row21 right 3s); unhelpful: No general extract_objects—detectors are hardcoded positions, brittle for variations; has_blue_in_middle_left range(1,4) but grid rows start 0, may miss row0.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—mentally, input has full left 0s (rows1-3 cols2-4 all 0), blue? no (cols7-9 has 1s but not H shape—row1 [1,8,1]? wait input row1 cols7-9=1,8,1? no, code checks [1,1,1] etc., so top_filled false; pink? no, cols12-14 row1=9,8,9 not 6s; red_u no; lightblue_c yes (row1 [9,8,9], row2 [9,9,8], row3 [9,9,9]); left 0s full so partial lower sides (rows13-15 cols1,5=3); blue_in_mid_left? row1-3 cols7-9 has 1s yes, so mid rows12-16 cols6-10=3; red top right yes (row1-3 cols17-19 has 2s), so fill_red true, row21 cols6-10=3, partial rows18-20 red pos=3, row17 mid if not top_filled and red mid left? red mid left no (cols7-9=1s), so no row17; lightblue_c so right partial rows18-20 and row21 cols16-20=3; bottom=2 since no top; but generated has row12-16 full 3s cols0-20 (overfill, should be only mid cols6-10 + sides); row13 left=3,7,3 good partial but col6-10=3 good, but cols11-15/16-20=3 wrong (no trigger); row17 empty good; row18 left empty wrong (full0 no top so sides only rows13/15 cols1,5 + row14 cols1,5, but row18 no); row21 full left/mid/right 3s but left? no bowtie (cols2-4=0 not 2/8/2), so only mid/right; row7-11 empty good (no upper pink/red/lightblue prop? wait lightblue_c should fill pos like (8,16)(8,18)(8,20) etc. to 3, but generated row8-10 cols16-20 empty/mixed, wrong—code has if has_lightblue_c: pos=[(8,16),(8,18),(8,20),...] =3, but in generated row8 col16=8 not 3); also row24 empty wrong, should be 8s (no lower trigger for full); overall, overfills lower mid/right without triggers, misses lightblue partials in upper mid-right, suggests broken full_lower_fill (full0 true but top_filled false, code has full_lower_fill = full0 and top_filled, so false good, but then blue_trigger true so mid fill good, but why full row12-16? code if blue_trigger: rows12-17 cols6-11=3, but generated cols0-20, bug in range? wait code range(12,17) cols(6,11), but output shows broader—perhaps copy error or logic leak.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 09:55:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring a Python program with a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like shapes or patterns) to generate correct outputs matching puzzle rules, such as identifying or transforming objects in the grid. The goal is to pass multiple training examples and a test input by producing accurate results without errors in code structure or logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive) that takes appropriate inputs (e.g., a grid as List[List[int]]) and returns the expected output; missing this leads to immediate failure across all evaluations.
 * Puzzle likely involves extracting and analyzing visual objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, holes, or connected components) from the grid, applying rules like counting features, matching patterns, or omitting invalid elements.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, varying grid sizes, or specific object properties (e.g., hole counts, connectivity); ensure the function handles empty grids, single-cell objects, or non-integer grid values if applicable.
 * Outputs must precisely match expected formats (e.g., strings, numbers, or modified grids); partial matches or formatting issues could fail even if logic is partially correct.
 * Consider performance for larger grids, but prioritize correctness; avoid hardcoding for specific examples to generalize across training and test cases.
 * All considerations from attempts: Basic code structure is foundational—without 'program', no logic can be tested; future attempts must include extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding connected components via flood fill) and rule application (e.g., filtering by properties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified yet, as the previous attempt lacked any functional code.
# Future attempts should include something like this for object extraction (example structure):
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Use flood fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (e.g., blobs of same value).
    # Return list of dicts with properties like {'position': (x,y), 'size': n, 'holes': count_holes(...)}
    pass
```

```python
# Example for hole counting in an object (subtle: assumes binary grid where 0s are background/holes).
def count_holes(component: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Implement boundary tracing or separate flood fill for enclosed 0-regions.
    # Return number of distinct hole areas.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (training examples 1-5 and test) failed identically due to missing 'program' function, resulting in structural errors rather than logical ones—no code was executed or evaluated for puzzle rules.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated beyond errors, so no progress on visual puzzle solving (e.g., no object extraction, rule application, or grid processing occurred).
 * What didn't work: Complete absence of required function signature prevented any testing of puzzle logic; this indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the submission format (must be a valid Python module with 'program' def).
 * No helpful functions were present or tested; any prior unhelpful code (e.g., standalone scripts without 'program') is broken for this setup and should not be reused—focus on modular functions that can be called within 'program'.
 * Missed basic requirement: Code must be importable and executable as a module; subtle formatting like indentation or syntax errors could compound issues, but here it's purely structural.
 * Train examples all errored uniformly, suggesting the attempt was a single invalid program applied to all—no variation or learning from examples was possible.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates a complete failure to meet the basic code requirement, preventing any puzzle-specific output (e.g., no processed grid, object summary, or rule-based result).
 * Expected test output should be a valid result based on mentally simulating puzzle rules on the test grid (e.g., if rules involve counting connected shapes or holes, output might be a number/string like "3 objects with 1 hole"; but without 'program', this can't be generated or verified).
 * The error differs from expectations because no puzzle logic ran—it's structurally invalid, not a mismatch in puzzle solving (e.g., wrong count or omitted object); this blocks handling test-specific subtleties like unique grid patterns or edge cases.
 * To handle the test case, ensure 'program' processes the input grid correctly (e.g., extract objects, apply rules like omitting those without holes if that's a rule—unknown without more details, but must generalize).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based visual filling puzzle (similar to a nonogram or region-coloring challenge) on a 30x22 grid, where fixed digits (0-9 except 8) act as clues in specific "clue bands" or regions to determine how to fill blank cells (8's) with either 2 (likely one color, e.g., red) or 3 (another color, e.g., blue). The goal is to propagate fills based on detected patterns of these digits across horizontal/vertical bands, ensuring consistent region completion without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Scans top band for any 0 (triggers top/mid fills)

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Pairs with zero_top for top fill=3, bottom=3

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all-0 in left for horizontal left fill

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers vertical mid and blocks some lower fills

def has_seven_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15))  # Enables middle band right fill (cols 11-20)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(set(non_eight)) == 1 and non_eight and non_eight[0] == 9  # Strict: all non-8 must be 9 for vertical far fill

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper left vertical (rows 7-12, cols 1-6)

# Aggregator for 2's in upper band (useful for lower middle fill condition)
def any_two_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any_two_left(g) or any_two_mid(g) or any_two_right(g) or any_two_far(g)

def any_four_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 4 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers lower left vertical (rows 18-23, cols 1-6)

def is_full_block_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) == 9 and len(set(non_eight)) <= 1  # Full 3x3 non-8 block in left blocks lower middle row 22
```

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a grid with predefined borders (e.g., rows of 3s and 6s) and clue areas (numbers 0-9 in rows 1-3 and a bottom clue row), where the goal is to fill unknown cells (8s) with 3s in specific regions (upper, middle, lower sections divided into left/mid/right/far columns) based on conditional rules derived from the clues, such as presence or patterns of certain digits triggering fills in rectangular or shaped areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed borders: top and bottom rows are often filled with 3s; a row of 6s appears consistently around row 5 (0-indexed); side borders are 8s that may remain unfilled or get partial 3s based on conditions.
 * Clues are in rows 1-3 (columns 2-21, grouped into left:2-5, mid:7-10, right:12-15, far:17-20) and a bottom clue row (row 29?); conditions check for any/all specific digits (e.g., any 0 or 1 in top clues triggers top fills; full zeros in left triggers middle-left fill).
 * Regions to fill are vertically/horizontally divided: upper (rows 7-11), middle (12-17), lower (18-26?); subregions like left (cols 1-6), mid (6-11), right (11-16), far (16-21); fills are rectangular blocks of 3s but sometimes shaped (e.g., specific positions for 'nine' in far right).
 * Subtleties: Fills can extend vertically across sections (e.g., long mid from 8-27 if conditions met); some fills depend on negatives (e.g., not has_one_mid); is_nine_right checks for non-8s being all 9s, but may overfill or underfill shapes; bottom row fill color (2 or 3) depends on top conditions, but often mismatches expected.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs leave large areas of 8s unfilled (e.g., row 17 in training 1 is all 8s in expected but filled with 3s in generated); upper left has specific non-rectangular patterns (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with gaps); far right 'nine' shape is irregular (specific positions like (18,16),(18,18), etc.); interactions between clues (e.g., zero_top + one_top + not full_zero_left for upper mid).
 * All attempts fill too many 8s into 3s in places where expected leaves 8s (overfilling blocks); bottom row sometimes uses wrong color (3 vs expected 2? but not shown); no handling for cases where clues like 7/9/6 trigger partial shapes vs full blocks.
 * Grid dimensions: ~30 rows x 22 cols; indices start from 0, but clues in rows 1-3; fills avoid borders (col 0/21 often 8 or 3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top clues; useful for triggering top/bottom fills

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks if left clue block is entirely 0s; key for conditional left fills

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return bool(non_eight) and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Detects if right clue is purely 9s (ignoring 8s); triggers shaped far fills

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Presence check for 2 in left; triggers specific upper left pattern
```
These functions correctly detect clue conditions and are reusable; no types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall program structure calls fill functions in sequence on a copy of g, replacing 8s with 3s based on clue checks; this works for top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0/4/29 filled correctly in training 1) and some rectangular blocks (e.g., middle right if has_seven_right), but overfills (e.g., fills long_mid even when not extending fully).
 * Training 1: Generated fills row 17 (middle lower?) with all 3s, but expected leaves it all 8s; also fills upper far with 3s via is_nine_right, but expected has no such fill in rows 8-11 cols 16-21 (mismatch in far right extension); bottom row correct as 3s, but lower left-mid overfills cols 1-11 row 18-21 where expected has 8s in row 17.
 * Training 2: Generated fills upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 with 3s, but expected leaves row 7 cols 6-11 as 8s (partial overfill); middle left/right/far underfilled (e.g., row 13 cols 1-6 expected 3s but generated 8s? Wait, generated has 3s in some but not consistently); bottom row as 3s but expected may imply 2 (not shown, unknown); also fills row 11 cols 6-11 with 3s unexpectedly.
 * Training 3: Top clues not triggering top 3s (generated starts with 8s in row 0, expected 8s—correct); but overfills upper left rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with full 3s, expected has gaps/partial in row 8; middle section rows 12-17 mostly 8s but expected fills row 17 cols 1-6/16-21 with 3s (underfill); lower far rows 22-26 overfills with 3s via fill_lower_far_two, but expected has shaped 3s only in specific cols.
 * Training 4: Top not filled (correct, starts 8s); middle rows 12-17 overfills cols 1-6 and 11-16 with 3s via fill_middle_left/right, but expected leaves row 17 cols 6-11/16-21 as 8s; lower mid row 18 underfills (generated 8s in cols 1-5, expected 3s?); bottom row 2s correct? but generated has 6s row 5 correct.
 * Training 5: Top filled with 3s unexpectedly (generated row 0 3s, expected 8s—overfill); upper right overfills cols 16-20 rows 8-11 with 3s, expected partial; middle far underfills rows 12-17 cols 16-21 (8s, expected 3s in some); lower left-mid fills row 18 cols 1-11 with 3s correctly? but row 19 cols 16-20 mismatched (generated 3s in gaps).
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: fill_upper_left_specific (hardcodes positions but overfills gaps, e.g., row 8 cols 2/4 as 3s when expected 8s in some cases); fill_lower_far_nine (specific positions but applies unconditionally if is_nine_right, leading to mismatches like filling (18,17) which may not be expected); fill_long_mid (extends too far, e.g., to row 26 when expected stops at 17); fill_bottom (uses 3 always if top conditions, but some expected bottoms are 2s or unfilled—broken logic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills top rows 0-4 with 3s (expected likely 8s based on training 3/4/5 patterns where top clues like 0/1/9 don't always trigger full top fill); upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 filled fully with 3s, but likely partial or none needed (similar to training 2 underfill issue); middle rows 12-17 cols 1-6 filled but row 12 cols 6-11/16-21 left 8s (underfill, expected shaped based on bottom clues 0/6?); lower far rows 22-26 has partial 3s in cols 16-21 but gaps like row 22 col 17=8 (mismatch, looks like incomplete 'nine' shape); bottom row 29 not shown but implied 3s, may be wrong if test clues suggest 2; overall, too many 3s in left/mid, leaving right/far inconsistent—does not make sense as it ignores negative conditions (e.g., not full_zero_left) and shaped fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where fixed digits (0-9, 6's on certain rows) provide clues to fill blank spaces (8's) with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on pattern-matching conditions derived from the positions and combinations of those digits; the goal is to replicate exact expected fillings across training examples, likely simulating rules for shading or completing a hidden image/diagram without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are often fully filled with 3's or 2's based on top/bottom conditions; row 5 and 29 are always 6's; rows 6-7 and some lower rows start as 8's but may get filled; the puzzle divides into vertical sections (left: cols 1-6, mid: 6-11, right: 11-21) and horizontal bands (upper: rows 8-12, middle: 12-18/23, lower: 18-28).
 * Filling only occurs where 8's exist—never overwrite non-8 cells; use value 3 for fills, but some conditions lead to 2's (e.g., bottom if no zero/one top).
 * Conditions are conditional and sometimes mutually exclusive: e.g., long vertical mid fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if one in mid AND two far-right; upper far-right fill if mostly 9's in right (not all 8's); bottom far if two far AND no one mid.
 * Subtle overlaps/conflicts: multiple fills can overlap (e.g., middle mid and long mid both target mid section, but order matters to avoid partial fills); some regions like lower left-mid (rows 17-23, cols 1-11) only if four in mid, but this may conflict with other middle fills.
 * Digit detection is row-restricted (e.g., tops in rows 1-4, cols 0-22; mid in rows 1-4, cols 7-11; left in cols 2-5/6; right in cols 12-16/17-21); "full zero left" requires ALL zeros in a subregion, while others are "any" (existence).
 * Easy to miss: "is_nine_right" checks for non-8 cells in right being ALL 9's (not just any 9); no fill if condition partial (e.g., mixed 7/8/9 in right doesn't trigger nine fill); bottom row fill to 2's if no zero AND one top; some examples have pre-filled 3's outside 8's, so program must copy input faithfully.
 * Across attempts: order of fill functions matters (early fills like top/bottom set global, later ones like middle may depend); unhandled cases like pre-existing 3's in input (e.g., training 3 has them in row 7) can cause mismatches if not copied; right section fills are tricky (e.g., seven_right any 7 triggers wide middle right, but nine_right needs purity).
 * General: Puzzle emphasizes precision—small mismatches (e.g., one cell wrong) fail the example; test cases vary in digit placements, so rules must generalize without hardcoding per-example.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 17 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (middle left over-filled, likely due to full_zero_left triggering despite context); also filled row 28-29 with 3's but expected 2's in some spots? Wait, actually bottoms match, but row 17 mismatch suggests middle_left fill ignores upper/middle interactions; subtle: expected has 8's in row 17 left, so condition like full_zero_left may be too broad or misranged (cols 2-5 vs 1-6).
 * Training example 2 CORRECT: All fills matched exactly, indicating core top/bottom, upper left (if two left), long mid (if one mid + two far), upper far (if nine right), middle sections, lower left-mid (if four mid), lower mid (if two mid), and lower far (if two far no one mid) worked perfectly here—likely because this example had clean, non-overlapping conditions without pre-filled 3's.
 * Training example 3 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 7 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (upper left triggered wrongly? Input has no two left in rows 1-4? Wait, input row 1-3 have 2's in left, but perhaps range issue); also row 23 (cols 1-6) filled with 3's expected 8's (lower left overreach); row 24 has extra 3's in right where expected 8's (long mid or middle right spillover); bottom rows 30-31 are 2's matching, but upper/middle mismatches suggest mishandling pre-existing 3's in row 7 or incorrect any_two_left detection.
 * Training example 4 INCORRECT: Generated row 17 (cols 1-6 and 6-11) filled with 3's where expected 8's in left-mid (middle left/mid triggered wrongly, perhaps full_zero_left false but still filled? Input has zeros left but not full; also row 18 over-filled); row 22-23 have partial 3's in left where expected 8's (lower left-mid if four mid, but input has no 4 mid? Mismatch unknown); row 24 empty matching, but middle sections differ by entire bands.
 * Training example 5 INCORRECT: Generated row 7 all 8's matching, but row 8 right has 3's interspersed (e.g., col 16-21) where expected none (upper far triggered wrongly—input has 9's in right but mixed with 3's? is_nine_right fails purity); row 12 filled left-mid with 3's expected 8's (middle left/mid over); row 17-18 filled with 3's expected partial; row 23 right has 3's where expected 8's (lower far triggered despite one mid present?); bottoms 3's but input suggests 2's possible.
 * Overall: Works for clean cases (ex 2) but fails on overlaps/pre-fills (ex 3-5) and strict conditions (ex 1,4); fill order helps but misses exclusions (e.g., don't fill if region already partial); no extraction of full objects, but detection funcs are solid—unhelpful: none really broken, but is_nine_right too narrow (cols 12-16 only, misses far-right 17-21); full_zero_left range (2-5) may need tweak to 1-6 for some.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-fills row 7 (cols 6-11) with 3's where likely expected 8's (long mid triggered, but input has one mid in rows 1-4 cols 7-11, yet two far present—condition may need stricter check); row 8-11 left/mid/right have 3's interspersed (e.g., cols 1-6,6-11,16-21) matching some upper fills, but cols 12-16 empty where seven_right absent (no 7's, correct no fill); row 12 left empty but mid empty (middle mid if one mid, but perhaps blocked by long mid?); row 17-18 over-filled mid/right with 3's expected partial/empty (middle right if seven, but no 7); row 22-23 left-mid filled if four mid (input has 4's in rows 18-20? Wait, clues in 1-4, but lower detect any_four_mid); row 24-27 right has 3's in cols 16-21 expected empty (lower far if two far no one mid, but one mid present); bottoms 3's due to zero/one top present, seems correct; overall, too many 3's in middle/lower, suggesting program fills without checking for pre-3's or condition negations, and test likely expects sparser fills like training 3/4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 30x22 grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 represent colors, with 8 as background and 3 as green highlight), where the top 5 rows contain a key pattern embedded in 8's, and the goal is to conditionally highlight (fill non-8 cells or backgrounds with 3) matching or similar patterns in designated middle sections (e.g., rows 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27) while setting the bottom 2 rows (28-29) to all 3's or 2's based on whether the top pattern meets a specific criterion (likely exactly 84 eights in the top 5 rows x 22 columns = 110 cells, implying 26 patterned cells). Other rows like dividers (all 6's in row 5, all 8's in some separators) remain unchanged, and the highlighting preserves the internal pattern colors while replacing surrounding 8's with 3's to "frame" or emphasize matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top 5 rows (0-4) serve as a key: if they contain exactly 84 eights (measured before any modifications), trigger green (3) filling in the top itself (replacing 8's but preserving non-8 pattern cells) and in matching middle sections; otherwise, leave the top unchanged and selectively green-fill only lower sections that match the key pattern independently.
 * Middle sections are bounded by all-8 or all-6 rows (e.g., rows 6-7 all 8's as separator, row 11 all 8's, row 17 all 8's, row 21-22 all 8's); green-filling typically replaces 8's in columns 1-20 (leaving border 8's in columns 0 and 21 intact) within pattern areas of rows like 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27, but only for sections whose internal non-8 patterns mirror the top key's shape/structure (e.g., blob-like clusters of 0's, 1's, etc., in similar positions).
 * Bottom rows (28-29) are set to all 3's if the top condition is met (indicating "match found" or "key valid"), otherwise all 2's; this acts as an indicator strip.
 * Subtleties: Patterns are not always fully symmetric or identical—matching may be based on shape topology (e.g., connected components, hole counts, or bounding boxes) rather than exact cell values; in some cases (e.g., train 3,5), top is not green-filled even if patterns exist, suggesting the 84-eight rule applies only to specific key types, while lower sections can be filled independently if they "match" the top regardless of count. Dividers (row 5 all 6's) and separator rows must remain untouched. Borders (columns 0,21) often stay 8 in filled sections for framing. Count eights only in top rows 0-4, columns 0-21, before any changes to avoid state mutation issues.
 * Easy-to-miss: Green-filling in middles is selective per section (e.g., in train 2, only columns 6-10 in rows 7-11 and 23-27 get 3's around a partial match; in train 1, full sections 12-16 filled); not all 8's in a section are replaced—only those surrounding patterns that match the key. In cases like train 3/4/5, top patterns vary (e.g., all-8 top in train 3 means no top fill, but lower matches trigger isolated fills). Internal pattern colors (e.g., 0,1,2,4,6,7,9) must be preserved, not overwritten. The puzzle may involve extracting "objects" (connected non-8 regions) to compare shapes across sections.
 * All rows not mentioned (e.g., 26-27 in some) may need conditional filling based on pattern similarity; test input has a unique top pattern (0's in col 2-4 row1-3, 1's in col7-9/7 row1-3, etc.), suggesting partial matches in lower sections like rows 18-20 or 23-25.

    return key_pattern.shape_hash == section_pattern.shape_hash
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single program attempt across all training examples failed entirely (all marked INCORRECT), primarily due to execution order: greenify_top_if_condition modifies the top (replacing 8's with 3's) before subsequent functions like set_bottom_based_on_top_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition check count_eights_in_top == 84, causing the count to drop below 84 post-modification, so bottom stays 2's (expected 3's in train 1/2) and middles remain unfilled (e.g., row 12 all 8's instead of bordered 3's in train 1).
 * Top greenification worked partially in train 1/2 (correctly replaced 8's with 3's while preserving patterns in rows 0-4), but failed in train 3/4/5 where top should remain unchanged (generated filled with 3's around patterns, but expected keeps original 8-background patterns without 3's, e.g., row 0 all 8's in train 3).
 * Middle filling (rows 12-17, cols 1-20) never triggered due to the mutated count, so sections like rows 12-16 stayed all 8's or original in all trains (e.g., train 1 expected bordered 3's with preserved 7/1/6/0 patterns, but generated all 8's; train 2 expected partial 3's in cols 6-10 rows 7-11/23-27, but generated unchanged).
 * Bottom setting always defaulted to 2's due to failed condition (e.g., train 1/2 expected all 3's, but generated all 2's; train 3/4/5 expected all 2's? but generated all 2's correctly by accident, though other parts wrong).
 * copy_pink_rows was a no-op (just returns copy), unhelpful and irrelevant (no "pink" mentioned, likely a red herring or broken remnant).
 * greenify_top_if_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition are partially helpful for the filling logic (preserve non-8's, target specific ranges), but broken by not checking condition before modification and lacking pattern matching— they blindly fill all 8's in ranges if condition met, missing selective section-based matching (e.g., train 2 only fills specific columns, not full range).
 * set_bottom_based_on_top_condition is conceptually useful for the indicator but broken by post-modification check; should check original input count.
 * No pattern extraction or matching implemented, leading to over-generalized filling (e.g., train 3 generated top/middle 3's incorrectly, ignoring that top didn't qualify for 84 eights); count_eights_in_top is helpful but must be called on original grid copy.
 * Train 1: Top correct, but middle unfilled (row 12 all 8's vs expected 8-3's-8), bottom 2's vs 3's; patterns in rows 13-15 expected preserved in 3-background but generated unchanged 8's.
 * Train 2: Top correct, but no 3's in rows 7-11/23-27 cols 6-10 (generated unchanged vs expected 3's around partial matches), bottom 2's vs 3's; also missed green in row 7 cols 6-10.
 * Train 3: Top incorrectly green-filled (generated 3's around patterns in rows 0-4 vs expected original 8-background), no selective lower fills (e.g., expected 3's in rows 7-11 cols 2-5/7-10? but generated unchanged); bottom correct by default but overall mismatch.
 * Train 4: Top unchanged correctly (but expected green? wait, no—generated top original, but expected some 3's in row 12-16; actually mismatched as middle unfilled vs expected bordered 3's).
 * Train 5: Top unchanged but expected partial 3's in lower sections (generated no changes vs expected 3's in rows 7-11/17-21 cols 16-20?); patterns mismatched for unknown reason (e.g., row 8 col 16-20 expected 3's around 9's but generated 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output makes no changes to the input grid (top rows 0-4 remain 8-background with patterns like 0's/1's/9's/2's unchanged, no 3's anywhere, bottom all 2's), which does not look correct because the top pattern (e.g., 0's in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, 1's in row 1 cols 7-9 and row 3 cols 7-9, etc.) likely qualifies as a valid key (count 8's to check ~84?), so expected top green-fill (3's replacing 8's around patterns), selective middle green-fills in matching sections (e.g., rows 12-16 or 18-20 may have similar 1/0/6/0 clusters needing 3-borders), and bottom all 3's; instead, it's entirely static, suggesting the condition failed entirely (possibly top count !=84, or order bug prevented any action).
 * No green highlighting in any middle sections (e.g., rows 13-15 have 7/1/6/0 patterns unchanged vs likely expected 3's bordering them if matching top), and bottom 2's vs probable 3's; this ignores potential partial matches (e.g., the 2/0/7/9 in rows 8-10 may not match, but 4/2/5/1 in 18-20 or 9/6/4/2 in 23-25 might).
 * Overall, test output looks incorrect as it treats the grid as "no matches" despite visible similar blob shapes (e.g., triple 0's/1's in top mirroring lower 7's/1's), failing to demonstrate any understanding of selective filling—needs pattern extraction to confirm matches before filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a deductive logic puzzle (possibly a variant of a battleship, nurikabe, or custom fill puzzle) where a grid contains fixed clues (numbers 0-9 representing shapes, counts, or states) and unknowns (8s to be resolved into specific numbers like 2, 3, 6 based on positional rules, band-filling logic, and conditional presence/absence of clues in designated regions). The goal of the program is to apply a sequence of rules to fill only the 8s without altering existing clues, producing a completed grid that matches the expected deductions for each training case.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 30 rows by 22 columns, with distinct bands/regions: top band (rows 0-4, clues in rows 1-3 cols 22?), middle deduction areas (rows 7-26 in sections like left/mid/right cols 1-6/6-10/11-20), bottom band (rows 28-29), and fixed full rows like row 5/25/30 all 6s, rows 0-4/28-29 often 3s.
 * Rules involve conditional rectangle fills (e.g., fill with 3 if certain clues like 0 and 1 coexist in "top" region cols 22; fill bottom with 3 if top has 0+1, else 2), but order matters—early fills can trigger later ones, and over-filling (e.g., filling non-8s or wrong regions) breaks matches.
 * Subtle clue regions: "top" clues seem in col 22 (rows 1-3), "left" in cols 2-5 (rows 1-3? but code uses 2-5), "mid" cols 7-11, "right" cols 12-16; "far" cols 17-21; avoid filling col 0/21/22 which are often boundaries (8s or fixed).
 * Presence/absence logic: e.g., "full_zero_left" requires all zeros in a subregion; "is_nine_right" checks if non-8s in right are all 9s (not just any 9); "any_two_*" detects 2s in specific zones to trigger extensions.
 * Do not fill non-8s (code has if out[r][c] == 8 check, which is good); some rules are mutually exclusive (e.g., lower far fill only if two far but no one mid).
 * Easy to miss: Top band fill is cols 0-21 (not 22); bottom is always filled but value depends on top condition; upper/middle/lower sections (rows 7-11,12-17,18-22) have parallel left/mid/right fills triggered independently; row 23-24 often untouched or partial; no fills in rows 6/23-27 except specific cases.
 * Grid has vertical/horizontal symmetry in clues but deductions are asymmetric; 3s seem to represent "filled/shaded" states, 2s "partial/empty", 6s boundaries.
 * All attempts fail due to over-filling (e.g., filling where expected is 8) or under-filling (missing triggers); code applies all rules unconditionally after checks, but some rules interact (e.g., upper mid extension only after base fills).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def full_zero_left() -> bool:
    return all(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks complete zero in left clue subregion; useful for triggering middle left fill.

def has_zero_top() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Detects 0 in top-right clue column; pairs with has_one_top for band fills.

                out[r][c] = val  # Safe fill-only-8s; essential to avoid overwriting clues.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core rules are incomplete or wrongly ordered; e.g., in Train 1, generated fills row 17 (0-based index 17) with 3s in cols 1-6 where expected keeps 8s (under-filled lower left? No, over-filled mid-left in row 12 where expected has 8s in some spots? Actually, Train 1 generated row 12: full 3s left-mid-right, but expected row 12 has 8s in left and partial 3s only mid-right—over-filled left).
 * Train 1 also incorrectly fills upper mid (rows 7-11 cols 6-10) with 3s due to has_one_mid() and any_two_far(), but expected has 8s there (rule triggers too early or wrongly).
 * Train 2 generated over-fills upper left (rows 7-11 cols 1-6) with 3s from any_two_left(), but expected keeps 8s; also fills bottom with 2s correctly (no 0+1 top), but middle right (rows 12-17 cols 11-20) partial 3s where expected has more 8s.
 * Train 2 mismatches lower far (rows 22-26? code has 22-26 but expected row 23 empty) by not filling due to has_one_mid() blocking, but generated has no fill there while expected has 3s in cols 6-10? Wait, unknown why—possibly rule range wrong (code uses 22-26 for far, but grid shows row 23 as 8s).
 * Train 3 generated fills bottom with 2s (correct, no top 0+1), but over-fills upper left/mid (rows 7-11) with 3s from any_two_left() and is_nine_right(), expected keeps more 8s; also fills row 17 with 3s where expected has 8s in mid.
 * Train 3 lower section (rows 18-22) over-fills left/mid with 3s, but expected row 17 empty in left; row 23 partial 3s in far but code misses (wrong row range for lower far: code 22-26 overlaps empty row 23-24).
 * Train 4 incorrectly fills top band with nothing (keeps 8s in rows 0-4), but expected has no top clues triggering 3s? Wait, input has top 0s/2s, code's has_zero_top() false? Mismatch in col 22 range; also over-fills middle left (rows 12-17 cols 1-6) with 3s from full_zero_left(), expected keeps 8s.
 * Train 4 lower left (rows 18-22 cols 1-6) filled with 3s, but expected row 17 empty; bottom 2s correct.
 * Train 5 over-fills upper (rows 7-11) empty due to no two_left, but fills middle right wrongly; lower mid (rows 18-22 cols 6-10) misses due to no two_top, expected has 3s? Also row 17 filled with 3s where expected empty.
 * Common issue: fill_rect ranges inconsistent (e.g., middle right code 11-20 too wide, expected 12-20?); top fill cols 0-21 includes boundaries; no handling for cases without full_zero_left (Train 4 has partial zeros, doesn't trigger).
 * Function full_zero_left is helpful but too strict (requires all zeros; Train 4 has partial, needs "any_zero_left"?); is_nine_right good but only triggers if no 8s mixed wrong.
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection for connected 8s), but not needed—rules are regional, not global.
 * fill_rect is essential and correct (only 8s), but unhelpful if ranges wrong (e.g., lower far 22-26 includes row 23-24 which should stay 8s).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding of band fills (top/bottom often close) but fail on sectional triggers (upper/mid/lower independence) and ranges (over-fill boundaries like col 0/21).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output fills top/bottom bands with 3s (likely from has_zero_top() and has_one_top() detecting 0 and 1 in col 22), which seems plausible if test input has those clues, but without input grid, can't confirm—however, since all trainings failed similar logic, this may over-fill if test lacks full triggers.
 * Middle sections over-filled: e.g., rows 12-17 cols 1-6/6-10/11-20 partial 3s, but based on Train 1/2 patterns, likely mismatches expected 8s in left (no full_zero_left?); upper rows 7-11 cols 1-6 filled from any_two_left(), cols 16-20 from is_nine_right()? But Train 3/4 show this over-fills.
 * Lower rows 18-22 cols 1-6/6-10 filled with 3s (from two_left and two_top?), cols 11-20 not (no seven_right?), but row 23-26 empty except possible far miss; rows 24-26 have no fills, expected likely partial 3s in mid/far per Train 3.
 * Does not look correct: Over-fills middle left (rows 12-17 cols 1-6 all 3s, but Train 1 expected 8s there without full_zero); upper mid partial 3s in cols 6-10/16-20 where Train 2 kept 8s; bottom 3s may be wrong if test top lacks 0+1 pair (Train 2 had 2s correctly). Subtleties like col 22 clues not propagating to col 0 boundaries (generated fills col 0 with 3s, but expected often 8s). Missing conditional blocks (e.g., lower far empty, but if any_two_far() and not has_one_mid(), should fill rows 22-26 cols 16-20 with 3s per code, but output shows 8s—bug in trigger?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where patterns of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors or empties) in the top panel (rows 1-3, columns 0-21) act as triggers to fill specific regions in the lower panels (rows 4-29, divided into horizontal sections like panels 2-5 and a bottom bar) with a background color (3) or other fills, while preserving or modifying certain art elements; the bottom two rows (28-29) are uniformly filled with 3 or 2 based on top conditions. The goal is to detect exact shapes like "O"s, broken shapes, or color clusters in the top and apply rule-based fills to complete the image without overwriting key elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top panel patterns must be detected precisely by position and shape: e.g., "zero left" requires 0s specifically in rows 1-3, columns 2-4 (not just any 0s); "strict blue O" needs exact 1s in columns 7-9 for rows 1 and 3, plus center at row 2 col 8, but not filling the entire O if it's not strict.
 * Fills with 3 (likely white/background) are conditional and sectional: top full fill only if zero_left AND strict_blue_o; vertical non-blue fills propagate top colors down only if row 2 is 8 and row 3 matches top; third panel (rows 12-16?) fills columns 1-5, 6-10 (if blue O), 11-20 (if seven middle); second/fourth panels (rows 7-11, 18-21) get full middle fills (cols 6-10) only if pink O top (specific 6s and 8s in cols 12-14 rows 1-3).
 * Art-specific fills are hardcoded and fragile: left red (2s in top left) triggers exact pixel fills in second/fourth left panels (cols 1-5, specific positions like row 8 cols 1,3,5=3); lightblue middle (9s with 8s in cols 12-14) fills right second panel gaps; yellow broken O (4s with 8s in cols 7-9) fills fourth middle gaps (cols 6-10 bottom rows).
 * Bottom fill (rows 28-29): 3 only if zero_left AND strict_blue_o, else 2 (darker background?); entire grid starts as copy, only overwrite 8s (blanks?) to 3.
 * Subtleties: Patterns like pink O include internal 8s (holes?) at specific spots (row2 col13=8, row3 col13=8); lightblue has mixed 9/8; yellow has broken top with 8 in middle. Overfills happen if conditions overlap without checks (e.g., filling art areas prematurely). No overwriting of non-8 cells. Grid dimensions: 30 rows x 22 cols, with horizontal dividers (all 6s or 3s in rows 0,4,5,25?,28-29; all 8s in some). Panels seem divided: top (0-4), then sections ~6-11,12-16,17-21,22-27? with vertical-ish columns (left 0-5, middle 6-10, right 11-15/16-20?).
 * Easy to miss: Third panel background fill uses set of columns (1-5 +11-20 if seven, +6-10 if blue O), applied to rows 12-16 only if 8; vertical top fills (rows 1-3 only?) skip blues (1s). No fills in row 22-27 except possibly bottom of fourth panel. Conditions are AND for some (e.g., top full), but independent for others. 0s are empties/holes, not to fill. Right fills (e.g., lightblue) are sparse, not full blocks.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The detection functions in the program are helpful for pattern recognition, as they isolate top triggers cleanly:

```python
def has_zero_left(out) -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))

def has_strict_blue_o(out) -> bool:
    return (all(out[1][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)) and
            all(out[3][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)) and
            out[2][8] == 1)

def has_seven_middle(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][12] == 7 and all(out[2][c] == 7 for c in range(12, 15)) and
            out[3][12] == 7)

def has_pink_o_top(out) -> bool:
    return (all(out[1][c] == 6 for c in range(12, 15)) and
            out[2][12] == 6 and out[2][14] == 6 and
            out[3][12] == 6 and out[3][14] == 6 and
            out[2][13] == 8 and out[3][13] == 8)

def has_red_left(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][2] == 2 and out[1][4] == 2 and
            out[2][3] == 2 and
            out[3][2] == 2 and out[3][4] == 2)

def has_lightblue_middle(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][12] == 9 and out[1][14] == 9 and out[1][13] == 8 and
            out[2][12] == 9 and out[2][13] -> 9 and out[2][14] == 8 and
            all(out[3][c] == 9 for c in range(12, 15)))

def has_yellow_broken_o(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][7] == 4 and out[1][8] == 8 and out[1][9] == 4 and
            out[2][7] == 4 and out[2][8] == 8 and out[2][9] == 4 and
            all(out[3][c] == 4 for c in range(7, 10)))
```

No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no general blob finder); the hardcoded detectors work for known patterns but miss variations. Column set for third panel fill is useful for modular fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, so core structure (copy grid, detect top patterns, conditional 3-fills on 8s, bottom uniform fill) works when zero_left + blue O trigger top/full fills and basic verticals.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated misses 3-fills in second panel top (row 7 cols 6-10 all 8s instead of 3s), third panel left/right (rows 12-16 cols 1-5/11-20 partial 3s missing), fourth panel middle full (rows 18-21 cols 6-10 has some 3s but incomplete vs expected), and bottom is 3s (correct? but expected has more 3s in panels); overfills nothing obvious, but underfills backgrounds where pink O should trigger second/fourth middles fully.
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated has wrong top fill (row 1 has 3,2,3 patterns instead of 8s), second panel left overfilled with 3s in cols 1-5 rows 7-11 (expected partial 3s only in row 7), third panel no fills (all 8s in cols 1-10/11-20 rows 12-16, expected 3s), fourth left overfilled similarly, bottom 2s (correct, since no zero_left/blue O); misses red left trigger for sparse art fills, applies full blocks instead.
 * Training 4: Incorrect; generated has third panel overfilled (rows 12-17 cols 0-5/11-21 all 3s, but expected only cols 1-5 partial and middle empty), fourth panel top row 17 all 8s (expected 3s in cols 6-10), pink O detection likely failed (no full middle fills in second/fourth), lightblue right fills missing (row 8-10 cols 16-20 partial 8s vs expected 3s); bottom 2s correct.
 * Training 5: Incorrect; generated misses all panel backgrounds (rows 7-11/12-16/17-21/22-27 all 8s except sparse, expected 3s in left/middle/right sections per triggers like blue O/seven/pink), no art fills (e.g., row 8 cols 17-21 8s vs expected 3s for lightblue), top patterns not triggering (e.g., strict blue O failed? since row 7 cols 6-10 8s); bottom 2s correct (no zero_left).
 * Vertical non-blue fill in top works in some (e.g., training 2 row 2 col 2=0 preserved), but not applied consistently.
 * Hardcoded art fills (e.g., for red left) are position-specific and work only if exact top red matches, but over-applied in training 3/4 without conditions.
 * has_lightblue_middle has a typo (out[2][13] == 9? but code says 9, expected may need 8); not triggered in most.
 * Full top fill (rows 0-4 all 3 on 8s) only if both zero_left AND blue_o, missed in training 3/5.
 * No general object extractor; hardcoded detectors are helpful but brittle for variations (e.g., broken O positions exact).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it resembles training 5's errors: no background 3-fills in any lower panels (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 6-10 all 8s, but top has blue O-ish 1s in cols 7-9 and zero left 0s in cols 2-4, so should trigger top full fill (rows 0-4 cols all to 3 on 8s) and third panel middles (cols 6-10 rows 12-16 to 3), plus bottom to 3s; instead bottom is 2s (wrong, since zero_left true and blue_o partial but strict check likely failed due to row 2 cols 7/9=1? wait, test top row2: 1,1,8? no, cols7-9 row2=1,1,8? output shows row1 (second list):1,8,1? wait, [8,8,0,0,0,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] so row1 cols7-9:1,8,1 (not all 1s), row2:1,1,8 (not 3,1,3 or strict), row3:1,8,1; so strict_blue_o false (needs all 1s in sides + center 1), zero_left true, so no top full, no bottom 3 (correctly 2), but misses other triggers like pink? top cols12-14: row1 9,8,9; row2 9,9,3 (not 6s/8s); seven? no; red left? row1 cols2/4=0 not 2; lightblue partial but not exact (row1 col13=8 ok, but row2 col14=3 not 8); yellow? cols7-9 row1:1,8,1 not 4,8,4. So minimal triggers, but generated still has no fills where vertical non-blue should apply (e.g., row2 col18-19=2,2 but if top row1 col18=2, row3=2? test row3 cols18-20=2,2,2, row2=2,3,2 so partial), and third panel empty (should fill cols1-5/11-20 if seven, but no seven). Overall, underfills everything, preserving too many 8s; expected likely has some 3s in left/right thirds per rules, and test fails strict detections leading to blank panels.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where specific colored shapes or patterns (represented by numbers like 1 for blue, 2 for red, 6 for pink, etc.) trigger conditional filling of blank spaces (8s) with a fill color (3, possibly green or neutral). The program processes the grid top-to-bottom, detecting patterns in upper, middle, and lower sections to apply fills in targeted areas, simulating rules like object recognition and propagation of fills based on presence/absence of shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 24-29 often contain full lines of 3s or 6s/bottom fills (e.g., bottom two rows always filled with 2 or 3 based on top patterns); rows 5-6 and 25? are full 6s; many rows have 8s as blanks to fill only conditionally.
 * Pattern detection is localized: e.g., upper section (rows 1-3, cols 7-9 for "blue H" as [1,1,1]/[8,1,8]/[1,1,1]); middle sections have U/C shapes in cols 1-20, rows 7-11 or 12-16; lower sections (rows 17-21) have bowtie/partial fills triggered by red (2) or lightblue (9) presences.
 * Fills are selective: Only replace 8s with 3s in specific positions (e.g., full rows, sides, partial shapes); never overwrite non-8s; order matters (top fills first, then middle, then lower).
 * Subtleties: "Top filled" (blue H) changes bottom color from 2 to 3 and enables broader fills; left 0s (blanks?) in rows 1-3 cols 2-4 trigger partial lower fills only if not full; red presence anywhere in certain col ranges triggers "red fills" but varies by top_filled state; lightblue C enables right-side partials; blue in middle-left (any 1 in rows 1-4? cols 7-9) triggers middle fills.
 * Easy to miss: Fills can overlap sections (e.g., upper fills propagate to row 5? but code shows rows 0-4? wait, code has range(5) for top); not all 8s fill—e.g., row 21 fills conditionally by section (left/mid/right); row 17 red fill depends on top_filled XOR red location; full left 0s + top_filled enables huge lower fill (rows 12-16, cols 1-20); partial 0 logic is nested (any0 but not full0 fills only sides at row 14 cols 1,5).
 * Bottom fill: Always rows 28-29 with 3 if top_filled, else 2; but in ex3/4/5 generated shows 2s, expected also 2s sometimes—suggests top_filled false in those.
 * No fills in some areas: e.g., rows 7-8 often remain 8s unless upper/middle triggers; row 12 sometimes fills fully if conditions met.
 * Colors: 0=empty/white, 1=blue, 2=red, 3=fill/green?, 4=orange?, 5=yellow?, 6=pink, 7=purple?, 9=lightblue; 8=blank to fill.

These detector functions are helpful for identifying trigger patterns (e.g., shapes like H/U/C/bowtie) in specific grid regions; they return booleans for conditional logic. The main program uses them to apply targeted 3-fills on 8s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct overall—likely because it had blue H trigger (rows 1-3 cols 7-9 as [1,1,1]/[3,1,3]? wait, code fills 8s to 3 post-detect, but input had proper 1s; bottom filled 3s; middle/lower partials matched expected.
 * Training 2: Incorrect—generated has row7 cols6-10 as 3s (from pink U? but expected row7 empty 8s); row8 cols0-5 as 8s/2s but expected 3s in left (missed upper fill prop?); row11 cols6-10 as 3s but expected empty; row12 empty but expected full 3s left/mid/right?; row14 col5 as 8 but expected 3? (partial 0 logic failed); row23 full 3s but expected empty 8s; row24 has 3s in left/mid but expected full 3s everywhere? (bottom fill wrong, top_filled false but should be true?); subtle: generated row9 col2=8 expected 3 (left fill miss); unknown why row17 empty when expected empty but row18-20 partials mismatch (e.g., generated row18 col2=4 not 3).
 * Training 3: Incorrect—generated row7 empty (good) but row11 cols0-5 as 3s expected empty; row12 empty expected empty (good); row17 empty expected full left 3s? no, expected row17 empty but row18 cols0-5 as 3s/4s, generated has 3s in left but overwrote non-8s?; bottom rows 28-29=2 good, but row24 empty expected full 3s in right? wait no, expected row24 has 3s only in right cols16-20; big miss: generated no fills in row8 (expected full left 3s cols0-5); row21 cols16-20 empty expected 3s (lightblue C trigger failed); row22 empty good; unknown why row18-20 left partials have 3s on non-8s like 4s.
 * Training 4: Incorrect—generated row12 cols11-20 as 3s but expected empty 8s (overfill mid/right); row13 col11=3 expected empty; row14 cols12-13=3,6 expected 3, empty? (fill prop wrong); row15 col12=3 expected empty; row16 full 3s expected empty; row17 empty good; but row18-21 partials mismatch (e.g., generated row18 cols0-5 empty expected 3s); bottom 2s good; subtle: left 0s full but no top_filled, so partial sides only, but code overfilled mid; unknown why row13 left has 3,7,3 but expected 3s more broadly.
 * Training 5: Incorrect—generated row7 empty good but expected full 3s cols16-20 (lightblue? but input has 9s in cols12-14 rows1-3); row8 cols16-20=3s expected full 3s; row12 empty expected empty; row17 empty expected full 3s cols16-20; row18 cols16-20=3s/1s but expected empty/non-fill; big miss: no upper fills in row7-8 right (C trigger not prop to row7); row21 cols16-20 empty expected 3s; unknown why row9-11 right has 3s on 9s (overwrote colors).
 * Overall: Detectors like has_pink_u/has_red_u work for mid fills (e.g., train2 pink triggered row7 3s correctly but over-applied); has_full_left_0 good for detecting but nested logic for partial fills (if any0 and not full0) fails in train2/4 (misses side 3s); top_filled prop to bottom color works (train1=3, others=2); red bowtie/left detectors underused—train3 has bowtie but no left row21 fill?; has_red_top_* any-in-range is too broad, causes false triggers (e.g., train5 red right but no mid fill); lightblue_c detects but partial right fills miss in train3/5 (e.g., no row21 right 3s); unhelpful: No general extract_objects—detectors are hardcoded positions, brittle for variations; has_blue_in_middle_left range(1,4) but grid rows start 0, may miss row0.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—mentally, input has full left 0s (rows1-3 cols2-4 all 0), blue? no (cols7-9 has 1s but not H shape—row1 [1,8,1]? wait input row1 cols7-9=1,8,1? no, code checks [1,1,1] etc., so top_filled false; pink? no, cols12-14 row1=9,8,9 not 6s; red_u no; lightblue_c yes (row1 [9,8,9], row2 [9,9,8], row3 [9,9,9]); left 0s full so partial lower sides (rows13-15 cols1,5=3); blue_in_mid_left? row1-3 cols7-9 has 1s yes, so mid rows12-16 cols6-10=3; red top right yes (row1-3 cols17-19 has 2s), so fill_red true, row21 cols6-10=3, partial rows18-20 red pos=3, row17 mid if not top_filled and red mid left? red mid left no (cols7-9=1s), so no row17; lightblue_c so right partial rows18-20 and row21 cols16-20=3; bottom=2 since no top; but generated has row12-16 full 3s cols0-20 (overfill, should be only mid cols6-10 + sides); row13 left=3,7,3 good partial but col6-10=3 good, but cols11-15/16-20=3 wrong (no trigger); row17 empty good; row18 left empty wrong (full0 no top so sides only rows13/15 cols1,5 + row14 cols1,5, but row18 no); row21 full left/mid/right 3s but left? no bowtie (cols2-4=0 not 2/8/2), so only mid/right; row7-11 empty good (no upper pink/red/lightblue prop? wait lightblue_c should fill pos like (8,16)(8,18)(8,20) etc. to 3, but generated row8-10 cols16-20 empty/mixed, wrong—code has if has_lightblue_c: pos=[(8,16),(8,18),(8,20),...] =3, but in generated row8 col16=8 not 3); also row24 empty wrong, should be 8s (no lower trigger for full); overall, overfills lower mid/right without triggers, misses lightblue partials in upper mid-right, suggests broken full_lower_fill (full0 true but top_filled false, code has full_lower_fill = full0 and top_filled, so false good, but then blue_trigger true so mid fill good, but why full row12-16? code if blue_trigger: rows12-17 cols6-11=3, but generated cols0-20, bug in range? wait code range(12,17) cols(6,11), but output shows broader—perhaps copy error or logic leak.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) where cells contain color codes (integers like 0 for empty, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc., up to 9) and 8 as a placeholder to be filled based on patterns or rules derived from the top section of the grid (roughly rows 0-4). The goal is to fill 8's in specific regions of the middle section (rows ~7-27) with 3 (green) according to structural or conditional rules (e.g., based on top colors, zero counts, or special configurations), while setting the bottom two rows (28-29) to either all 3 (green) or all 2 (red) depending on whether the top qualifies as "special." Fixed rows like 5 and 25 are all 6's (possibly a separator or background), and edges are often 8's that may or may not get filled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top section (rows 0-4) determines overall behavior: count of 8's in rows 0-4 (special if exactly 84), count of 0's in rows 1-3 (e.g., ==9 triggers specific fills), and set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3 (e.g., {2,4} or {1,9} triggers region-specific fills).
 * Bottom rows 28-29 are uniformly set to 3 if top is special (fill_top_with_green also applies), else to 2; this is consistent across examples but overrides other logic.
 * Middle fills target 8's only, preserving existing colors/0's; regions include vertical strips (e.g., cols 6-10 rows 7-17), partial rows (e.g., row 12 and 16 cols 1-20, with specific cols in 13-15), and "train"-like areas (e.g., left/bottom-right blobs filled conditionally).
 * Subtleties: Fills are not global—e.g., fill_full_second fills rows 12-17 cols 1-20 completely if conditions met, but fill_partial_second is more selective (top/bottom of that block + specific cols); vertical_middle is a narrow strip; train3_regions fills three disconnected areas (left upper, bottom-left middle, bottom-right lower); train5_regions fills two vertical-ish areas. Existing non-8 cells (e.g., 0's, colors) block or pattern-match fills.
 * Easy to miss: Top colors exclude 0/8 but include scattered non-8's that form patterns (e.g., blobs of 1's, 2's); zeros==9 suggests a specific sparse top pattern. Special check is row-limited (only top 5 rows, all cols). Edges (col 0/21) often remain 8 or get partial fills. Fixed rows (5,25 all 6's; sometimes top/bottom all 8's or 3's) must not be altered. Bottom green requires special=true, but red is default.
 * Across attempts: Program applies fills sequentially but conditionally (if special then green bottom + top fill, else red bottom); then nested ifs for middle based on zeros/special/colors, with else fallback to partial_second. This works for ex1 but overfills or underfills regions in others (e.g., filling where expected is 8 or different color). No rotation/flipping; assumes grid is oriented with patterns like "trains" or blobs in fixed positions.
 * Considerations: Patterns in top/middle suggest object detection (e.g., connected components of same color), but current code uses hardcoded regions—may miss dynamic shapes. 8's are fillers, but some expected outputs leave 8's unfilled (e.g., ex3 top is all 8's, not filled). Bottom red in ex3/4/5 but generated green in some. Test input has mixed top (0's and colors like 1,9,2), suggesting partial_second or train logic, but generated fills middle with green in wrong spots.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                s.add(col)
    return s
```

```python
# Fill functions (all target only 8's, preserve others)—useful for region-specific green fills:
def fill_top_with_green(grid):  # Fills all 8's in entire grid? (but code shows rows 0-4? Wait, code is full grid—may overfill).
    for r in range(5):  # Actually only top 5 rows in code, despite name.
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                grid[r][c] = 3

    for r in range(12, 17):
        for c in range(1, 21):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                grid[r][c] = 3

def fill_partial_second(grid):  # Selective: rows 12/16 cols 1-20; specific cols in 13/15/14.
    # ... (as in code)

def fill_vertical_middle(grid):  # Narrow vertical: rows 7-17 cols 6-10.
    # ... (as in code)

def fill_train3_regions(grid):  # Three areas: rows 7-11 cols 1-5; 17-21 cols 1-10; 23-26 cols 16-20.
    # ... (as in code)

def fill_train5_regions(grid):  # Two areas: rows 7-16 cols 6-10; 17-21 cols 16-20.
    # ... (as in code)
```
Note: No object extraction function present; hardcoded regions work for ex1 but fail dynamically. set_bottom_green/red are simple but essential for bottom uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Ex1 correct: Likely matched special or zeros==9 with full fills, producing exact green regions and bottom green; top fill and middle logic aligned perfectly (no differences noted).
 * Ex2 incorrect: Generated fills rows 18-20/23-25 with green in positions like (18,6-10)=3 (but expected 8 there? Wait, expected has 3's in (18,6-10) actually—no, diff is in rows 18-20: generated has no 3's in col 6-10 for row 18-20, but expected has 3's there; also row 23-25 col 0-5/16-20 get partial green but expected full 3's in some blob shapes (e.g., expected (23,6-10)=3 but generated 8). Bottom green correct, but middle underfills "train" areas; top colors {1,2,6,9?} fallback to partial_second overfills row 12-16 selectively wrong.
 * Ex3 incorrect: Generated sets top rows 0-4 to all 3's (but expected all 8's—no fill); bottom to green (expected red); middle fills like rows 7-17 cols 6-10=3 (but expected partial or 8 in some); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; rows 23-26 cols 16-20 partial green but expected more structured (e.g., col 16-20 row 23=3 but with extensions). Overfills based on assuming special=false but colors={2,4}? Actually top has 2/4 blobs, so triggered train3 but filled wrong regions; bottom should be red since not special.
 * Ex4 incorrect: Generated fills rows 12-16 cols 0-21 with green blobs (e.g., row 12 all 3's but expected row 12 cols 6-20=3 partial); row 13-15 have 3's around existing 7/1/6/0 but expected more uniform 3's in cols 6-20; row 17 no fill (correct?); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; bottom red correct. Underfills lower middle (e.g., rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20=8 but expected some 3's); zeros in top==9? but triggered partial_second wrongly, ignoring blob shapes around 7/1/6.
 * Ex5 incorrect: Generated top rows 0-4 unchanged (correct, all 8's? No, top has 1/9 blobs, expected unchanged); but row 7 cols 6-10=3 (expected 8); row 17 cols 16-21=3 partial (expected 8); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=3 but expected 8/3 mixed; rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20 no fill but expected 3's in some; bottom red correct. Triggered train5 for {1,9} but overfills vertical middle instead of exact train5 regions; partial_second fallback wrong for scattered 1's.
 * Overall: Hardcoded regions help for static fills but miss dynamic blob extension (e.g., fill around existing colors like in ex2 expected row 18 col6-10=3 extending from top); special check works but top fill overapplies in non-special (ex3); colors set detection good but {2,4}/{1,9} triggers wrong for mixed tops; zeros==9 not handling full vs partial accurately (ex4 underfills). No function for blob detection—essential for extending fills to match shapes (e.g., connect 8's to existing colors). fill_top_with_green limited to top 5 but name/code confusing. program() copies grid correctly but sequential ifs cause fallback overfill (else: partial_second too broad).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Top rows 0-4 unchanged (has 0's and blobs of 1/9/2—correct, no full fill); but middle row 12-16 filled with full green block cols 0-21 (e.g., row 12 all 3's, but likely should be partial around existing 7/1/6/0/9); row 17 no fill (8's, possibly correct); rows 18-20 cols 0-5/11-15/21=8 but cols 6-10=8 (should extend to 3? based on ex patterns); rows 23-25 cols 0-5=8 but expected some green extension for 2-blob; bottom red (correct for non-special). Top colors ~{1,2,9}, zeros~9?, so should trigger partial_second or train mix, but generated overfills row 12-16 uniformly (ignores existing 0/7/1/6/9 shapes) and underfills lower (no train3/5 for {1,9}+2). Looks like fallback partial_second applied wrongly—missing blob-aware filling to match expected structured greens around colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle where a 30x22 grid containing numbers 0-9 (as clues or partial shapes) and 8's (blanks to be filled) must have the 8's replaced selectively with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on detecting the presence or patterns of certain numbers in predefined sub-regions (e.g., left, mid, right areas across rows). The goal is to "complete" visual elements like bars, frames, or object outlines by filling only when clues indicate a match, while leaving some 8's unfilled to preserve structure; entire rows or blocks (e.g., top/bottom) may fill with 3's or 2's conditionally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural rows: rows 0-4 and 28-29 often fill entirely with 3's (or 2's if top conditions fail), row 5 and 25-26 with 6's, row 6/7/11/12/16/17/21/22/27/28 with potential 8's or partial fills; vertical bars (e.g., col 0/21 often 8's) and horizontal dividers must not be over-filled.
 * Clues are sparse numbers in rows 1-3 (top), 8-10 (upper mid), 12-16 (lower mid), 18-20 (bottom left/mid), 23-25 (bottom right); detect "any" presence (e.g., one 0 or 1 in a column range) or "all non-8" patterns (e.g., all non-8's are 9's in a region) to trigger fills, but only fill 8's, not overwriting existing numbers.
 * Subtleties: Fills are region-specific (e.g., left: cols 1-6 or 2-5, mid: 6-11 or 7-11, right: 11-21 or 12-16/16-21); order matters (early fills like top can affect later checks); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill divider rows like 17/22 if conditions partial); "full_zero_left" requires all in range ==0, not "any"; "is_nine_right" checks non-8's are all 9's but allows 8's; bottom fills (e.g., rows 18-22) depend on combos like has_one_mid + any_two_far for tall verticals, but exclude if not full match; test cases show asymmetric patterns (e.g., 2's or 4's scattered, not uniform).
 * Easy to miss: Some regions overlap (e.g., right fills span 11-21, affecting far right); conditions like "not has_one_mid" prevent fills in alternatives; bottom rows 28-29 always 3's if top has both 0 and 1, else 2's; vertical consistency (e.g., if left has any_two, fill rows 7-12 cols 1-6); no fills in cols 0/21 or row edges if 8's there; puzzle preserves "shapes" like 7's in right or 0's in mid without overwriting.
 * All attempts consider row ranges like 7-27 for tall fills, but miss partial matches (e.g., if two_far but no one_mid, fill only subset); include checks for scattered clues (e.g., any_four_mid triggers bottom left fill); avoid filling if clue is isolated (e.g., single 2 doesn't always trigger).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown (same program for all) passed training example 2 (full logic worked for that case's clues, e.g., top 0+1 triggered full top/bottom 3's, and mid/right conditions aligned without overfill).
 * Failed training 1: Over-filled row 17 (cols 6-11 and possibly others) with 3's due to has_one_mid and any_two_far triggering tall fill range(7,27) mid, but expected keeps it 8's (likely because two_far is in bottom rows 18-22, not top rows 1-3 for the check; check ranges mismatch clue locations).
 * Failed training 3: Filled row 7 left with 3's (correct), but row 17 left/mid empty in generated vs expected filled row 17 empty but row 18 filled correctly; also bottom row 28-29 filled with 2's incorrectly (top lacked 0+1?); row 22 filled partially wrong (expected 3's in right but generated 8's); any_two_left triggered upper left but missed lower dependencies.
 * Failed training 4: Top filled correctly with 0's present, but row 17 mid filled with 3's incorrectly (expected 8's, similar to train 1 overfill); row 18 left filled but expected empty in some; bottom row 28-29 with 2's wrong (should be 3's); is_nine_right not triggered properly, leaving right partial.
 * Failed training 5: Top not filled (no 0/1 in top? generated keeps 8's row 0-4); row 8 right over-filled with 3's in col 16-20; row 17 empty correct but row 18 mid over-filled; has_one_mid triggered tall mid but expected partial (e.g., row 7 empty); bottom 28-29 with 2's wrong.
 * Conditions like any_two_far use top rows 1-3 but clues often in bottom (e.g., rows 18-22), causing false positives/negatives; full_zero_left too strict for partial 0's; no function to check bottom-specific clues (e.g., any_two in rows 18-20); fill_region helpful but ranges too broad (e.g., range(7,27) fills dividers); is_nine_right useful but range(12,16) misses far right; no extraction for full shapes (e.g., count 9's exactly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top/bottom filled with 3's correctly assuming 0+1 in top row 1-3; left/mid/right regions filled in rows 12-17 based on 7/1/0 clues; bottom rows 18-22 filled with 3's around 4/2/1/5 clues) but does not look fully correct: over-fills row 7-11 mid/right with 3's (e.g., col 6-11 in row 8 has 3's around 0's, but may encroach on upper structure; expected likely keeps some 8's for separation); row 23-27 right over-filled vertically (e.g., col 6-11 in 23-27 has 3's around 6's, but test has scattered 9's/6's/2's suggesting partial fill only); row 12 left filled but col 1-6 has 3's overwriting potential edges; differences from logic: any_two_far likely false (2's in bottom col 17-21, not checked there), yet tall mid fill happened, mismatching train 1 issue; bottom row 28-29 correct as 3's, but overall too many 3's in verticals (e.g., col 3 in rows 7-27 all 3's, likely breaks shape); does not account for no has_seven_right (9's instead), so right fill range(12,17) cols 11-21 wrong—expected partial 8's preserved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) with fixed structural elements (e.g., bands of 3s, 2s, or 6s in specific rows) and clue numbers (0,1,2,7,9) placed in certain positions, where the goal is to replace all 8s (unknown cells) with either 2 or 3 to form coherent regions or "blobs" based on positional rules and interactions between clues. The filling rules appear to propagate from clue conditions to fill rectangular regions, with 3 often indicating a "primary" or connected fill and 2 a "secondary" or default fill, while avoiding overfilling or conflicting with existing clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed bands: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are horizontal bands filled entirely with 3 or 2; row 5 and row 30 are always full 6s (perhaps dividers or walls); rows 6-7 and 25-27 often start as 8s but get partial fills.
 * Clues (0,1,2,7,9) are checked in specific subregions (e.g., "top" clues in rows 1-3, cols 0-21 for 0/1/2; "left" in cols 2-4; "mid" in cols 7-10; "right" in cols 12-15 or 16-20), and conditions like "has_zero_top" or "is_nine_right" (which requires all non-8s in a region to be 9 and at least one present) trigger fills only in 8s within target rectangles.
 * Subtleties include conditional dependencies: e.g., bottom band fills with 3 only if top clues have both 0 and 1; upper left fill extends to col 6 under specific 2 placements; long mid (rows 8-26, cols 6-10) requires both 1 in mid and 2 in far right; row 17 mid fill depends on negation (not full_zero_left); lower far has early/late variants based on 1-left vs. (2-far and not 1-mid).
 * Order of function calls in program() matters, as fills only target 8s and later fills can overwrite if regions overlap (though current code avoids this by sequential non-overlapping regions).
 * Easy-to-miss: Fills are rectangular but sometimes partial (e.g., upper left adds col 6 conditionally); "full_zero_left" requires all three cells in rows 1-3, cols 2-4 to be 0 (not any); no fills touch clue positions (preserves 0/1/2/7/9); bottom rows 28-29 default to 2 unless top condition met; some regions like middle right (rows 12-16, cols 11-20) fill broadly if 7 in right.
 * Across attempts, issues include overfilling (e.g., filling where clues block or conditions not fully met), underfilling (e.g., missing propagations to adjacent cols like 6 or 11), ignoring negations (e.g., not full_zero_left), and mishandling "is_nine_right" (fills even if mixed non-8s). Test cases highlight sensitivity to clue interactions across vertical bands (left/mid/right).
 * No rotation or symmetry assumed; all checks are absolute positions. 8s outside defined regions may remain unfilled, but expectations show all 8s filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current code uses simple any/all comprehensions for conditions, which are helpful for quick regional checks. No complex types or extractions needed yet, but potential for region-specific validators.

                out[r][c] = val  # Core filling tool; only targets 8s, preserves clues
```

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_upper_far` relies on `is_nine_right` which may misfire if region has 8s mixed with non-9s (it collects non-8s correctly but assumes presence implies fill—subtle bug in some cases). `fill_row17_mid` uses complex negation which failed in Train3/5. No object extraction functions present or needed; simple grid iteration suffices.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct—properly filled top/bottom bands with 3s (due to 0/1 top presence), upper/middle/lower regions with 3s based on 2-left, 1-mid, 7-right, etc.; no over/underfills observed.
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated extra 3s in row7 cols6-10 (should be 8s, as no long_mid trigger without 2-far?); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left requires full_zero_left, which isn't met); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (condition (has_one_mid and not full_zero_left) or any_two_mid not fully satisfied); row22 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (no upper_left propagation?); overall, overfilled mid/left regions without strict conditions.
 * Train3: Incorrect—underfilled row7 (expected 3s in cols1-5, but generated 8s—upper_left missed due to no 2-left? Wait, clues have 2s there); row11 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left overtriggered); row16 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle regions missed); row17 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s in cols6-10 only? No, expectations show row17 all 8s except mid 3s—generated missed mid; row18 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s initially then propagated; bottom rows 30-31 are 2s as expected but top clues lacked 0/1 pair? Major issue: left/mid fills inconsistent with negations and propagations.
 * Train4: Correct—handled complex interactions like 1-left triggering lower_far_early, 2-top for lower_mid, etc.; all regions filled precisely without extras.
 * Train5: Incorrect—row12 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_mid triggered wrongly without strict 1-mid?); row16 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle_left missed); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (row17_mid overtriggered); row21 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_left/mid missed due to no 2-left/top?); row22 all 8s but expected partial 3s in lower; overfilled some right regions with 3s where 8s expected (e.g., row8-11 cols16-20).
 * General: Conditions like full_zero_left and negations (not full_zero_left) often fail, leading to missed or extra mid fills; upper_far works when 9s present but not if mixed; long_mid undertriggers without 2-far; no function for extracting full clue regions (e.g., to validate blob shapes), which might help debug; fill order causes no overwrites but misses chained fills (e.g., upper to middle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—while top/bottom bands are properly 3s (due to 0-top and 1-top present), and some regions like upper left (rows8-11 cols1-5=3s), middle mid (rows12-16 cols6-10=3s), lower left/mid (rows18-21 cols1-5/6-10=3s) match expectations, there are mismatches: row7 cols1-5 are 8s but should be 3s (upper_left trigger from 2-left present, but code's any_two_left should catch it—possible col range issue in fill_upper_left); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but if not full_zero_left (clues show mixed 0s), expected 8s; row22 cols16-20 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_far_late should trigger from 2-far and not 1-mid? Clues have 2s far right); row24-26 cols16-20 partial 3s but code filled full, mismatching sparse 2-clue positions; overall, underfills vertical propagations (e.g., row22-26 left/mid should chain from upper) and overfills bottom mid without negation check; does not make complete sense as some 8s remain (e.g., row7, row22 partial), violating full-fill expectation, and ignores subtle extensions like col6 in upper left.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:03:27] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) that represents segmented or patterned images (possibly digits or shapes formed by numbers like 0-9), where the task is to process the input grid by selectively replacing background '8's with '3's in specific regions based on "clue" patterns detected in the top rows (1-3), effectively completing or outlining puzzle elements while preserving borders, non-background areas, and certain columns (e.g., the rightmost column often remains '8'). The bottom rows (28-29) are uniformly set to '2' or '3' based on top clues, and the program must avoid over-filling or misapplying changes that alter expected preserved '8's or digit shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top rows (1-3) contain clue digits (e.g., 0,1,2,6,7,9) in specific column ranges: left (c=2-5 for 0/2), mid (c=7-10 for 1), center-right (c=12-15 for 7/6/9), far-right (c=17-21 for 2/6). These trigger conditional filling of '8's to '3's in vertical/horizontal strips below (e.g., rows 7-26 in columns 6-11 for mid-1, or full-width rows 12-17 for certain combos like left-0 + center-7).
 * Filling is region-specific and not always full-width: e.g., left regions (c=1-6) for left clues, mid (c=6-11), right (c=16-20), avoiding c=0/21 (borders stay '8'). Subtle: some fills stop short (e.g., row 12 in train 1 expected ends with '8' at c=21, not '3'); combos like top-0+1 trigger broad fills (e.g., rows 5/28-29 to '3', row 6 untouched), while isolated 2's trigger '2' bottoms and partial fills.
 * Bottom rows (28-29) default to '2', but switch to '3' if top has both 0 and 1 anywhere (across c=0-21); row 30-31? Wait, grids show 30 rows, but code uses 28-29—possible off-by-one. Preserve digit shapes: never change non-8's (e.g., keep 0/1/2/4/5/6/7/9 intact in their positions).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Fills are only on '8's (not overwriting digits); some regions overlap (e.g., mid-fill after left); right-side logic (e.g., all-9 in c=12-15 triggers row 21 c=16-20 to '3'); no fill if conditions not met (e.g., train 3 has top-2/4, leading to partial '3's only in specific strips, bottoms '2'); borders (c=0/21, some rows) stay '8'; vertical strips vary by clue (e.g., left-2 triggers rows 7-11/18-22 c=1-6, but not full height).
 * Across attempts: Code checks top for any() presence but re-checks after initial changes, risking order-dependency; misses precise width (e.g., mid c=7-10 clues fill c=6-11 but sometimes only to c=10); ignores some combos (e.g., train 5 top-1/9 no broad fill); bottoms incorrectly '3' when top lacks 0+1; over-fills right column c=21 to '3' when expected '8'.
 * General: Grid has fixed layers (e.g., row 5/6 always 6's? No, varies; row 0/4/30? All 3's in some, 8's/2's in others); puzzle may simulate "drawing" borders around detected digit clues.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate functions in the provided code; it's a monolithic if-chain with any() checks on top rows. Helpful would be modular detectors:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def detect_top_clues(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    """Extract presence of digits in top rows (1-3) by column ranges."""
    clues = {
        'zero_left': any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(2,6)),
        'one_mid': any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(7,11)),
        'two_left': any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(2,6)),
        'two_far': any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(17,22)),
        'seven_right': any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(12,16)),
        'nine_right': all(g[r][c] == 9 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(12,16) if g[r][c] != 8),
        'has_zero_top': any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(22)),
        'has_one_top': any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(22)),
        'two_top': any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(22)),
    }
    return clues

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols: range, value: int):
    """Safely fill '8's in a rectangular region with value (e.g., 3), preserving non-8's and borders."""
    for r in rows:
        for c in cols:
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = value
    # Note: Explicitly avoid c=0 and c=21 unless specified.

def set_bottom_rows(out: List[List[int]], clues: dict):
    """Set rows 28-29 based on top clues."""
    if clues['has_zero_top'] and clues['has_one_top']:
        for r in range(28, 30):
            for c in range(22):  # But expected often keeps c=21 as 8? Check per case.
                out[r][c] = 3
    else:
        for r in range(28, 30):
            for c in range(22):
                out[r][c] = 2
```

These would help modularize the code, avoid re-checking modified grids, and ensure precise ranges (e.g., cols=range(1,21) to skip borders).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating incomplete understanding of conditional filling rules and region boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated over-filled row 12 with all 3's (including c=21=3), but expected [8,3's up to c=20,8]; rows 13-16/17 have c=21=3 but expected 8; rows 18-21/22-27 correct but bottoms row 28-29 all 3's match expected; missed preserving right border '8's in left/mid fills; any_two_top logic filled extra in rows 18-22 c=6-11 unnecessarily? (unknown why, but differs).
 * Train 2: Generated 3's in row 7 c=6-11, but expected c=6-10 only (c=11=8); similar over-fill in rows 11-17/18-22/23-27 c=6-11/1-6; row 7 c=6-11 has extra 3 at c=11; bottoms all 3's but expected 3's? Wait, expected bottoms 3's but with c=21=8? No, expected all 3's but code filled full; left/mid fills too wide, missing narrow mid (c=7-10 clue -> c=6-10 fill).
 * Train 3: Generated bottoms row 28-29 all 2's (correct), but over-filled row 7 c=6? No, row 7 all 8's but expected 3's c=0-5? Wait, expected row 7 [8,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] but generated all 8's except some; row 23 has 3's c=16-20 but expected 8's; row 24-26 have 3's in c=0-5/16-20 but expected 8's there; missed top-2/4 triggering narrow left fills (rows 7-11 c=1-5 to 3) and no mid fill; function-like any() checks worked for bottoms but failed region precision.
 * Train 4: Generated row 12 all 3's (c=0-21), but expected [8,3's c=1-20? Wait, expected [8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8] — irregular, 3's in c=1-5,11-20; code filled uniform strip rows 12-17 c=1-21 to 3, over-filling c=6-10/21 and missing pattern; row 18 all 3's c=1-21 but expected partial; bottoms 2's correct for no 0+1 top.
 * Train 5: Generated row 7 all 8's, but expected [8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (3's c=6-10 for mid-1?); row 12 [8,8,8,...3's c=6-10,8's] but generated uniform 3's c=6-10; over-filled row 21 c=16-20 to 3? Expected partial; bottoms 2's but top has 1+9 (no 0), expected 2's correct; missed narrow fills for isolated 1/9 (e.g., rows 12-17 no fill, but row 7 mid yes).
 * Overall: Code's broad for r in range(7,27) / c=6-11 fills too wide/deep (e.g., includes c=11/21); order of ifs causes cascading over-fills (e.g., has_one_mid after initial changes); non_eight_right check buggy (len>0 and all 9's triggers row 21 c=16-20, but in train1 with 7's it didn't trigger correctly?); any_two_top fills rows 18-22/23? c=6-11 even without mid; no handling for top-4/5/9 specifics (e.g., train3/5 have them but fills mismatch); unhelpful: direct any() on modified out (changes mid-checks); row_end=22/23 logic unclear/broken (fills to row 22 or 23, but expected varies); the monolithic structure makes debugging hard—break into detect/fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3's similar to train 1/2 failures (e.g., row 12 all 3's including c=21=3, but likely expected c=21=8 based on pattern; rows 13-16 c=21=3 vs expected 8; row 7 3's c=6-11 but probably should be c=6-10 only for mid-1 clue; bottoms row 28-29 all 3's, correct only if top has 0+1 which it does (0 left,1 mid), but c=21 likely 8; row 1 has 1 at c=8/9? But generated 1,3,1 — wait, input not shown but output has irregular 1's/3's in top mid, suggesting code modified top incorrectly? No, code copies out = [row[:]...], but fills only below—top should be preserved, but output shows top row1 [3,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,9,...] with extra 3's in mid, implying bug in clue detection or unintended top fill (unknown why, but differs from expected preservation). It partially handles 0+1+9+2 combo (broad fills + right 9-check?), but misses border preservation and narrow widths, making it inconsistent with train expectations (e.g., no uniform strips for 9-right like row 21 partial).

[2025-10-02 10:03:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:22:29] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where the input grid contains digits 0-9 representing drawn shapes or patterns (like letters or symbols formed by connected numbers), and 8's represent unfilled blanks that need to be completed by filling with 3's (for full panels or areas) or 2's (for partial or bottom sections) based on pattern recognition in specific 3x3 subgrids across top, middle, and bottom panels. The goal is to detect symbolic patterns (e.g., H, T, or other letter-like forms) in horizontal strips of subgrids to trigger area fills, while handling special cases like vertical extensions or conditional bottom fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is divided into panels: top (rows 0-4, all columns filled with 3's under certain conditions), middle panels (rows ~7-26, divided into left/middle-right sections with base columns at 2,7,12,17 for 3x3 subgrid extraction starting at row 1), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 3's or 2's based on top patterns).
 * Subgrids are 3x3 extracted from specific positions (e.g., left: rows 1-3 cols 2-4; middle-left: cols 7-9, etc.), and patterns are matched exactly as tuples (e.g., full H1: ((1,1,1),(8,1,8),(1,1,1)); T7: ((7,8,8),(7,7,7),(7,8,8))).
 * Core rule: If left subgrid is only 0's and 8's AND middle-left is only 1's and 8's, fill top panel and bottom with 3's; else fill bottom with 2's—subtlety: this is a global trigger, but overrides don't always apply correctly in mixed cases.
 * Special cases for "panel 2" (middle rows 12-17? cols 1-20): Exact set match of three specific patterns (T7 left, H1 middle-left, small6 middle-right) triggers full fill with 3's; vertical middle-left fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if left is 0/8 and middle-left is full H1.
 * Additional specials: If middle-right is T7, fill panel2 left area (rows 12-17, cols 1-6) with 3's; if right is small6 ((8,6,6),(8,6,8),(8,6,6)), fill panel2 middle-right and right areas (cols 11-16 and 16-21).
 * For non-0/8 left subgrids, fallback to individual pattern matching across 3 panels (top/middle/bottom strips at base rows 8,13,18), with fixed patterns per panel (e.g., panel1 has bowtie2, empty0, etc.; panel3 has pyramid4, etc.) triggering 5x5 area fills (row base-1 to +4, col base-1 to +4) only where 8's exist.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Fills only replace 8's (not overwrite existing numbers); area bounds are clamped to 0-21 rows/cols; bottom fill choice (2 vs 3) depends on top patterns but can be overridden; patterns must match exactly, including 8 positions; no fill in row 5-6 or 30? (always 6's?); panel2 specials can overlap or conflict with individual matches; vertical fills are narrow (cols 6-11) and long (rows 7-27).
 * Global: Out copies input, fills are conditional and non-destructive to non-8's; empty patterns like ((0,0,0),(0,0,0),(0,0,0)) in panel2 may trigger nothing; top row 0 and bottom rows 28-29 are uniform fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns are letter/symbol-like (e.g., 7=T, 1=H, 6=small E?, 2=bowtie/Z, 4=pyramid/A, 9=box, 0=empty/dot); connected components implied but not explicitly checked (code uses exact tuple matches); order of conditions matters (e.g., global top/bottom before specials before individual); incomplete fills leave 8's, which is wrong if expected to be filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_subgrid(g: List[List[int]], r_start: int, c_start: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [[g[r_start + i][c_start + j] for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]

def sub_to_tuple(sub: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[Tuple[int, ...], ...]:
    return tuple(tuple(row) for row in sub)

def is_only_0_8(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    for row in sub:
        for v in row:
            if v != 0 and v != 8:
                return False
    return True

def is_only_1_8(sub: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    for row in sub:
        for v in row:
            if v != 1 and v != 8:
                return False
    return True
```
These are useful for extracting and checking 3x3 subgrids at fixed positions (e.g., top row patterns at r_start=1, c_starts=2,7,12,17) and converting to immutable tuples for set/exact matching; they correctly identify empty-ish (0/8) or specific symbol (1/8) regions without overcomplicating connectivity.

```python
def fill_area(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int):
    r_start = max(0, r_start)
    r_end = min(22, r_end)  # Note: grid is 22 cols, but rows up to 29?
    c_start = max(0, c_start)
    c_end = min(22, c_end)
    for r in range(r_start, r_end):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = 3
```
Helpful for targeted 8-replacements in rectangular areas (e.g., 5x5 for individual patterns, full panels for globals); clamping prevents index errors, but row min/max seems off (grid has 30 rows, but code uses min(22,r_end)—likely a bug, as outputs show 30 rows with bottom at 28-29).

The following functions are broken or not helpful: fill_top_panel (fills rows 0-4 cols 0-21 with 3's overwriting 8's, but should check bounds/conditions better); fill_bottom_3 and fill_bottom_2 (fill only rows 28-29, but grid has 30 rows—row 30? is missing or always 3's?); fill_entire_panel2 (fills rows 12-18 cols 1-21, but overlaps and may overfill); fill_vertical_middle_left (fills rows 7-27 cols 6-11, narrow but long—useful but triggers too broadly in some cases). These are panel-specific and rigid; avoid in future without generalization.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated overfilled middle panel1 (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 6-10 with 3's where expected 8's; row 7 all 8's except left; panel2 row 11 cols 12-17 filled 3's but expected 8's; panel3 rows 17-21 no fills but expected some 8's to 3's?); bottom rows 28-29 correctly 3's; top correct. Differences: Extra 3's in middle-left (cols 6-10 rows 7-11) and panel2 edges; missed panel3 fills (e.g., row 16 cols 12-16 should be 8's per expected).
 * Training 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched exactly—no differences noted, suggesting global top/bottom trigger and individual pattern matches worked perfectly for this case's patterns (likely only 0/8 left + 1/8 middle-left, plus matching fixed patterns without specials conflicting).
 * Training 3 (INCORRECT): Generated filled panel2 bottom (rows 28-29 with 2's, but expected 2's only partially? Wait, expected has 2's bottom but generated also has extra 3's in panel3 rows 16-21 cols 16-21?); top panel1 rows 7-11 left filled 3's but expected 8's in middle; panel4? row 21 partial 3's but expected full 8's row 21. Differences: Bottom uniform 2's but expected mixed/partial; overfilled panel2 left (rows 7-11 cols 1-5 with 3's, expected 8's); missed vertical in middle-right; row 16 cols 16-21 3's where expected 8's.
 * Training 4 (INCORRECT): Generated no fills in panel2 middle (rows 12-16 all 8's except patterns, but expected 3's in cols 11-21 rows 12-16); bottom 2's but expected 3's in panel2; top panel1 correct but panel3 rows 17-21 no 3's in cols 0-5/11-15. Differences: Missed panel2 fills entirely (e.g., rows 12-16 cols 0-10 8's expected 3's?); bottom uniform 2's vs expected 3's; individual matches failed for panel3 (e.g., row 12 cols 11-15 3's missing).
 * Training 5 (INCORRECT): Generated partial 3's in top extensions (e.g., row 7 cols 16-21 3's but expected 8's); panel2 overfilled vertically (rows 7-11 cols 16-21 3's, expected 8's); bottom 2's but expected 3's; panel3 rows 17-21 cols 16-21 3's where expected partial. Differences: Extra vertical 3's in right sections (rows 7-11/16-20 cols 16-21); missed H1 extensions in middle-left; top patterns triggered wrong bottom (2's vs 3's); individual fallback over-applied to non-8 areas.
 * Overall: Global condition (0/8 + 1/8) works when true (e.g., train2) but fails to propagate fills correctly in mixed cases (trains 1,3,4); panel2 set-match rarely triggers (missed in 3,4,5); individual pattern matching buggy (wrong base rows/cols, e.g., base_rows=[8,13,18] but fills row-1 to +4 overshoot; fixed_patterns lists incomplete or mismatched for some symbols like 9/box); order of ifs causes specials to skip (e.g., vertical after set but before individual); no handling for row 30? (outputs show 30 rows, but code may cap at 22); extract_subgrid essential but fixed positions miss vertical/off-horizontal patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 filled 3's correctly per global 0/8 left + partial 1/8 middle-left trigger; middle panel1 rows 7-11 patterns preserved with no overfill; panel3 rows 17-21 patterns intact with 8's unfilled as expected for non-match; bottom uniform 3's fits if top qualifies) but does not look fully correct—middle-left rows 12-16 cols 6-10 have 3's filling 8's around 1's (suggesting H1 vertical trigger), but right cols 12-16 rows 12-16 unfilled 8's around 9's (missed individual match for panel2 9-pattern? expected 3's there?); top row1 cols 7-11 has 1,3,1 instead of all 1/8 (overfilled 8's to 3's prematurely); panel4? rows 22-26 all 8's except patterns, but expected partial 3's in cols 16-21 for 2-pattern extension (generated has them as 8's). Unknown why row 1 middle-left overfills to 3's (possible bug in fill_area clamping or order); overall, ~70% filled correctly but misses panel2/3 individual fills and has subtle overfills, so likely incorrect without expected grid to confirm—needs better pattern tuple matching for 9/2 symbols and vertical propagation.

[2025-10-02 10:22:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:32:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a grid (likely 31 rows by 22 columns, with numbers like 0,1,2,3 representing colors or states and 8 as blanks to fill), where patterns in the top panel (rows 1-4) trigger rules to fill blanks in middle and bottom sections with color 3 (or sometimes 2). The goal is to derive and apply conditional filling rules based on observed shapes and presences in the top, propagating to form connected or matching structures below.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top panel (rows 1-4, columns varying by section like 2-5 for left, 7-10 for middle left, 12-15 for middle right, 17-20 for right) contains diagnostic patterns (e.g., full "blue U" as three 1s in rows 1 and 3 cols 7-9 plus row 2 col 8; full 0 bar as all 0s in rows 1-3 cols 2-4) that act as triggers for filling entire shapes or connections in middle (rows 7-22) and bottom (rows 22-31).
 * Subtle elements include conditional negations (e.g., fill only if top has 1s but NOT full 0 bar), specific partial fills (e.g., around 7s in row 14 adjacent to blanks, or targeted positions like row 9 cols 6/10 for 0s shape), and connections (e.g., row 14 cols 11-20 as a bridge between sections).
 * Blanks (8s) are filled selectively only where they match the triggered shape, without overwriting existing numbers; bottom filling can be color 2 or 3 based on top U presence.
 * Grid boundaries must be respected—assuming fixed 31x22 size, but errors suggest possible variation or 0-indexing mismatches (e.g., rows 0-30, cols 0-21).
 * Rules are hierarchical/dependent (e.g., rule 9 requires full U and not 0 bar, overlapping with others like rule 5), so order matters to avoid over-filling; some rules (like 13) are placeholders for covered cases.
 * Easy to miss: presence checks (e.g., "has_top_left_2" scans for 2 in cols 2-4 rows 1-3) are loose (any occurrence triggers), not exact positions; bottom is uniformly filled across all 22 cols but only in rows 28-30; no filling in row 0 or top itself except rule 1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Helper for full blue U in top middle left (rows 1-3, specific cols 7-10)
def has_full_blue_u_top(out):
    return (out[1][7:10] == [1, 1, 1] and
            out[2][8] == 1 and
            out[3][7:10] == [1, 1, 1])
```
```python
# Helper for full 0 bar in top left (rows 1-3, cols 2-4)
def has_full_0_bar_top(out):
    return all(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))
```
```python
# Presence checker for top left 1s (any 1 in rows 1-3, any col)
def has_top_1s(out):
    for r in range(1, 4):
        if 1 in out[r]:
            return True
    return False
```
```python
# General filling utility (used in many rules: fill 8s in specified row ranges/cols with 3)
def fill_region(out, rows_range, cols_range):
    for r in rows_range:
        new_row = out[r][:]
        for c in cols_range:
            if new_row[c] == 8:
                new_row[c] = 3
        out[r] = new_row
# Note: This is a suggested refactor; original code inlines similar logic repeatedly.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt defines 13 detailed rules based on top patterns triggering middle/bottom fills, showing good understanding of puzzle structure (e.g., U shapes, bars, presences of digits like 1,2,4,6,9), but all executions fail with "list assignment index out of range" errors, likely due to assuming fixed grid size (e.g., accessing row 30 or col 21 on smaller inputs).
 * What worked: Rule logic captures many dependencies (e.g., conditional not full 0 bar, targeted positions like row 8 cols 16/18/20 for 9s shape), and helpers like has_full_blue_u_top accurately detect key triggers; bottom uniform fill in rows 28-30 cols 0-21 is correctly color-dependent.
 * What didn't work: Crashes prevent any output generation, so no fills occur; over-assumes grid dimensions (e.g., [bottom_color] * 22 sets full row but may exceed input width; accesses like out[3][7:10] fail if rows/cols shorter); no bounds checking or dynamic size detection.
 * Rule order may cause overlaps (e.g., rule 9 fills row 14 cols 11-20, potentially conflicting with rule 5's adjacent fills), but untestable due to errors.
 * No object extraction functions attempted (e.g., no helpers to identify shapes like U or bars beyond simple checks), which could help generalize but isn't essential if rules are hardcoded.
 * Helpers like has_top_middle_right_9 and has_top_left_2 are specific and useful for triggers but brittle (e.g., scan entire row slice for presence, which works if patterns are isolated).
 * The pass in rule 13 is a placeholder noting coverage by rule 9, which is fine but highlights redundancy.
 * Overall, problem understanding is partial: rules seem derived from training visuals, but implementation ignores potential input variations, leading to total failure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("list assignment index out of range"), so no grid is generated and it does not make sense or look correct—expected a filled grid with 8s replaced by 3s (or 2s) in pattern-matching regions, but crashes prevent evaluation.
 * Likely mismatch: code assumes at least 31 rows (accesses row 30) and 22 cols (e.g., out[r] = [bottom_color] * 22), but test input may have fewer (e.g., 20x20 or variable), causing index errors on assignment or slicing (e.g., out[1][7:10] if col <10).
 * Without output, can't confirm if fills would match expected (e.g., if test has top full U, should fill top rows 0-4 with 3s over 8s and bottom rows 28-30 fully with 3s), but errors mean it doesn't handle test case at all.
 * To fix for test: Add grid size checks (e.g., rows = len(g), cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0; clip ranges to min(rows,31), etc.) and avoid full-row assignments.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 10:32:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle requiring a Python program with a specific 'program' function that processes grid-based inputs (likely 2D lists representing visual elements like shapes or patterns) to generate correct outputs matching puzzle rules, such as identifying or transforming objects in the grid. The goal is to pass multiple training examples and a test input by producing accurate results without errors in code structure or logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The code must define a function exactly named 'program' (case-sensitive) that takes appropriate inputs (e.g., a grid as List[List[int]]) and returns the expected output; missing this leads to immediate failure across all evaluations.
 * Puzzle likely involves extracting and analyzing visual objects (e.g., blobs, shapes, holes, or connected components) from the grid, applying rules like counting features, matching patterns, or omitting invalid elements.
 * Subtle elements include handling edge cases like irregular shapes, varying grid sizes, or specific object properties (e.g., hole counts, connectivity); ensure the function handles empty grids, single-cell objects, or non-integer grid values if applicable.
 * Outputs must precisely match expected formats (e.g., strings, numbers, or modified grids); partial matches or formatting issues could fail even if logic is partially correct.
 * Consider performance for larger grids, but prioritize correctness; avoid hardcoding for specific examples to generalize across training and test cases.
 * All considerations from attempts: Basic code structure is foundational—without 'program', no logic can be tested; future attempts must include extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding connected components via flood fill) and rule application (e.g., filtering by properties).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# No helpful functions identified yet, as the previous attempt lacked any functional code.
# Future attempts should include something like this for object extraction (example structure):
def extract_objects(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[dict]:
    # Use flood fill or DFS/BFS to find connected components (e.g., blobs of same value).
    # Return list of dicts with properties like {'position': (x,y), 'size': n, 'holes': count_holes(...)}
    pass
```

```python
# Example for hole counting in an object (subtle: assumes binary grid where 0s are background/holes).
def count_holes(component: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Implement boundary tracing or separate flood fill for enclosed 0-regions.
    # Return number of distinct hole areas.
    pass
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All attempts (training examples 1-5 and test) failed identically due to missing 'program' function, resulting in structural errors rather than logical ones—no code was executed or evaluated for puzzle rules.
 * Nothing worked: No outputs were generated beyond errors, so no progress on visual puzzle solving (e.g., no object extraction, rule application, or grid processing occurred).
 * What didn't work: Complete absence of required function signature prevented any testing of puzzle logic; this indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the submission format (must be a valid Python module with 'program' def).
 * No helpful functions were present or tested; any prior unhelpful code (e.g., standalone scripts without 'program') is broken for this setup and should not be reused—focus on modular functions that can be called within 'program'.
 * Missed basic requirement: Code must be importable and executable as a module; subtle formatting like indentation or syntax errors could compound issues, but here it's purely structural.
 * Train examples all errored uniformly, suggesting the attempt was a single invalid program applied to all—no variation or learning from examples was possible.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an error ("ERROR - Generated code does not contain 'program' function"), which does not make sense or look correct—it indicates a complete failure to meet the basic code requirement, preventing any puzzle-specific output (e.g., no processed grid, object summary, or rule-based result).
 * Expected test output should be a valid result based on mentally simulating puzzle rules on the test grid (e.g., if rules involve counting connected shapes or holes, output might be a number/string like "3 objects with 1 hole"; but without 'program', this can't be generated or verified).
 * The error differs from expectations because no puzzle logic ran—it's structurally invalid, not a mismatch in puzzle solving (e.g., wrong count or omitted object); this blocks handling test-specific subtleties like unique grid patterns or edge cases.
 * To handle the test case, ensure 'program' processes the input grid correctly (e.g., extract objects, apply rules like omitting those without holes if that's a rule—unknown without more details, but must generalize).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based visual filling puzzle (similar to a nonogram or region-coloring challenge) on a 30x22 grid, where fixed digits (0-9 except 8) act as clues in specific "clue bands" or regions to determine how to fill blank cells (8's) with either 2 (likely one color, e.g., red) or 3 (another color, e.g., blue). The goal is to propagate fills based on detected patterns of these digits across horizontal/vertical bands, ensuring consistent region completion without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has distinct horizontal bands: top (rows 0-4, often filled with 3's if conditions met), a separator row 5 (all 6's, untouched), upper clue band (rows 6-11, mostly blanks with scattered clues), middle fill band (rows 12-17, for horizontal fills), lower clue band (rows 18-27, with clues and fills), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 2 or 3 based on top conditions).
 * Clues are localized: e.g., "left" (cols 2-5), "mid" (cols 7-10), "right" (cols 12-15), "far" (cols 17-21); checks must scan rows 1-3 or 8-27 for digits like 0 (indicating zero-fill or block), 1 (partial fill trigger), 2 (anywhere triggers vertical/horizontal extensions), 4 (lower left/mid triggers), 7 (right triggers), 9 (specific non-8 check for vertical fills).
 * Subtleties: Fills are conditional and exclusive—e.g., vertical fills in mid (cols 6-11) only if 1 in mid AND 2 in far, but blocked if conflicting; bottom fill is 3 only if top has both 0 and 1, else 2; full blocks (e.g., 9 non-8's in left) prevent certain extensions; overfills happen if conditions ignore exclusions (e.g., filling row 7 prematurely); no fills in clue rows unless propagated vertically; 6's in row 5 and some separators (e.g., col 0/21 often 8 or fixed) are never changed; subtle: "any_two_top" aggregates multiple regions but excludes far for some checks; is_full_block_left requires exactly 9 non-8's of one type to trigger.
 * Easy to miss: Order of fills matters (e.g., top/bottom first, then verticals, then horizontals to avoid overwriting); partial matches (e.g., not all 9 cells for block) shouldn't trigger; interactions between bands (e.g., upper 2's affect lower fills only if not blocked by mid conditions); no diagonal or global checks—strictly regional; preserve fixed digits (0-9 !=8); test cases vary top clues (e.g., 0/1 vs. none) flipping bottom to 2.
 * Across attempts: Detect "is_nine_right" as all non-8's being 9 (len==1 unique); avoid filling clue rows (e.g., rows 8-11,18-27) unless vertical propagation; bottom far fill (rows 23-27, cols 16-21) conditional on 2's but blocked by mid 1+far 2; lower middle (rows 18-22, cols 6-11) fills only if any 2 in top AND not (mid1 + far2).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code has several useful detector functions for clue patterns; these can be reused/refined as they correctly identify localized digits without over-scanning.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Scans top band for any 0 (triggers top/mid fills)

def has_one_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Pairs with zero_top for top fill=3, bottom=3

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all-0 in left for horizontal left fill

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers vertical mid and blocks some lower fills

def has_seven_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15))  # Enables middle band right fill (cols 11-20)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(set(non_eight)) == 1 and non_eight and non_eight[0] == 9  # Strict: all non-8 must be 9 for vertical far fill

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper left vertical (rows 7-12, cols 1-6)

# Aggregator for 2's in upper band (useful for lower middle fill condition)
def any_two_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any_two_left(g) or any_two_mid(g) or any_two_right(g) or any_two_far(g)

def any_four_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 4 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Triggers lower left vertical (rows 18-23, cols 1-6)

def is_full_block_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) == 9 and len(set(non_eight)) <= 1  # Full 3x3 non-8 block in left blocks lower middle row 22
```

No new types needed; List[List[int]] for grid is sufficient. No extraction functions provided (e.g., no object/blob detectors), but the above are helpful for pattern matching—avoid inventing irrelevant ones like full grid scans.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first consolidated attempt shown, but it succeeds fully on training example 1 (all fills match expected, including top/middle/bottom bands and verticals), demonstrating core understanding of top 0+1 triggering 3-fills and basic vertical propagations.
 * Fails on training 2: Generated misses filling row 7 (cols 6-10) with 3's (all 8's vs. expected 3's), likely because fill_middle_band doesn't trigger for mid (has_one_mid true but perhaps wrong col range 6-10 vs. 7-10 clue); also row 17 (cols 6-10) underfilled (8's vs. 3's in expected? Wait, expected has row 17 all 8's in mid—actually minor diffs elsewhere like row 23 col 0=8 vs. expected 8, but main issue is overfill in bottom far? No, bottoms match; subtle: generated fills row 8 cols 6-10 with 3's but expected doesn't until later? Unknown why row 7 specifically missed.
 * Fails on training 3: Generated incorrectly fills row 11 (cols 1-6) with 3's (but expected 8's), over-propagating upper_left_fill without block check; row 17 (cols 1-6) filled 3's vs. expected 8's (lower_left_fill triggers wrongly without 4-mid?); bottom rows 28-29 all 2's match but row 27 (cols 16-21) underfilled 3's in some spots vs. expected; also row 24 cols 16-21 has extra 3's in col 21 vs. expected 8. Function vertical_middle_fill over-applies without exclusion for no top 0/1.
 * Fails on training 4: Generated overfills middle band rows 12-17 (cols 0-5 and 6-11 with 3's, but expected only partial); row 17 cols 0-5=3's vs. expected 8's; lower left row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (misses vertical from full_zero_left?); row 22 all 8's vs. expected partial 3's in mid. is_full_block_left likely false but used wrongly to block; bottom 2's correct but no top 0/1 here.
 * Fails on training 5: Generated fills row 7 cols 16-21 with 3's vs. expected 8's (vertical_far_fill triggers on 9-right but wrong rows 8-12/17-22); row 11 cols 16-21=3's vs. 8's; row 17 cols 6-11=8's vs. expected 3's (misses lower_middle_fill due to any_two_top true but blocked by has_one_mid + any_two_far?); row 24 cols 16-21 underfilled. No extract_objects function present or needed—clue detectors suffice, but fill order (e.g., vertical before horizontal) causes overwrites.
 * Overall: Works for cases with top 0+1 (full 3-propagation), but fails on exclusions (e.g., not filling if mid1 + far2 blocks lower); underfills horizontals in middle band (wrong col ranges); overfills verticals in clue rows (e.g., rows 8/18). No broken functions, but fill_middle_band is imprecise (uses 1<=c<=5 for left but clue is 2-5; 6-10 for mid but fill 6-11?); bottom_far_fill condition "any_two_right_or_far" too broad without full exclusion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it overfills several areas inconsistent with patterns in training expecteds. For example, top band (rows 0-4) all 3's assumes has_zero_top and has_one_top, but test clues show 0's in left (cols 2-5 rows 1-3) and 1's in mid (cols 7-10), so correct; however, row 7 (upper blanks) has no fills (all 8's? Wait, generated shows row 7 all 8's, but expected should have cols 6-11=3's if vertical_middle_fill, but test has 1-mid and 2-far? Generated misses this, leaving 8's vs. likely expected 3's). Row 12-17: overfills left/mid with 3's (cols 0-5/6-11), but expected might limit to col 2-5 for full_zero_left and 6-10 for has_one_mid + has_seven_right (cols 11-20 partial 3's, but generated fills 11-20 fully?). Lower band row 18 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (upper_left_fill from any_two_left true); row 23 cols 0-5=8's vs. expected 3's (lower_middle_fill from any_two_top but not blocked? Test has mid1 + far2, so should block—generated fills row 23 cols 6-11=3's wrongly). Bottom rows 28-29=3's correct (top 0+1). Far verticals (cols 16-21 rows 8-12/17-22) filled 3's on is_nine_right, but row 24-27 underfilled (only partial 3's vs. expected full if not blocked). Overall, doesn't match training expecteds' subtlety (e.g., no fill in row 7 mid, overfill in lower middle despite block)—likely needs stricter exclusions and col-precise fills to handle test's combined clues (0-left,1-mid,7-right,9-right,2-far,4-lower mid).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a grid with predefined borders (e.g., rows of 3s and 6s) and clue areas (numbers 0-9 in rows 1-3 and a bottom clue row), where the goal is to fill unknown cells (8s) with 3s in specific regions (upper, middle, lower sections divided into left/mid/right/far columns) based on conditional rules derived from the clues, such as presence or patterns of certain digits triggering fills in rectangular or shaped areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed borders: top and bottom rows are often filled with 3s; a row of 6s appears consistently around row 5 (0-indexed); side borders are 8s that may remain unfilled or get partial 3s based on conditions.
 * Clues are in rows 1-3 (columns 2-21, grouped into left:2-5, mid:7-10, right:12-15, far:17-20) and a bottom clue row (row 29?); conditions check for any/all specific digits (e.g., any 0 or 1 in top clues triggers top fills; full zeros in left triggers middle-left fill).
 * Regions to fill are vertically/horizontally divided: upper (rows 7-11), middle (12-17), lower (18-26?); subregions like left (cols 1-6), mid (6-11), right (11-16), far (16-21); fills are rectangular blocks of 3s but sometimes shaped (e.g., specific positions for 'nine' in far right).
 * Subtleties: Fills can extend vertically across sections (e.g., long mid from 8-27 if conditions met); some fills depend on negatives (e.g., not has_one_mid); is_nine_right checks for non-8s being all 9s, but may overfill or underfill shapes; bottom row fill color (2 or 3) depends on top conditions, but often mismatches expected.
 * Easy to miss: Some expected outputs leave large areas of 8s unfilled (e.g., row 17 in training 1 is all 8s in expected but filled with 3s in generated); upper left has specific non-rectangular patterns (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with gaps); far right 'nine' shape is irregular (specific positions like (18,16),(18,18), etc.); interactions between clues (e.g., zero_top + one_top + not full_zero_left for upper mid).
 * All attempts fill too many 8s into 3s in places where expected leaves 8s (overfilling blocks); bottom row sometimes uses wrong color (3 vs expected 2? but not shown); no handling for cases where clues like 7/9/6 trigger partial shapes vs full blocks.
 * Grid dimensions: ~30 rows x 22 cols; indices start from 0, but clues in rows 1-3; fills avoid borders (col 0/21 often 8 or 3).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks for any 0 in top clues; useful for triggering top/bottom fills

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks if left clue block is entirely 0s; key for conditional left fills

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return bool(non_eight) and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Detects if right clue is purely 9s (ignoring 8s); triggers shaped far fills

def any_two_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Presence check for 2 in left; triggers specific upper left pattern
```
These functions correctly detect clue conditions and are reusable; no types defined, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall program structure calls fill functions in sequence on a copy of g, replacing 8s with 3s based on clue checks; this works for top/bottom borders (e.g., rows 0/4/29 filled correctly in training 1) and some rectangular blocks (e.g., middle right if has_seven_right), but overfills (e.g., fills long_mid even when not extending fully).
 * Training 1: Generated fills row 17 (middle lower?) with all 3s, but expected leaves it all 8s; also fills upper far with 3s via is_nine_right, but expected has no such fill in rows 8-11 cols 16-21 (mismatch in far right extension); bottom row correct as 3s, but lower left-mid overfills cols 1-11 row 18-21 where expected has 8s in row 17.
 * Training 2: Generated fills upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 with 3s, but expected leaves row 7 cols 6-11 as 8s (partial overfill); middle left/right/far underfilled (e.g., row 13 cols 1-6 expected 3s but generated 8s? Wait, generated has 3s in some but not consistently); bottom row as 3s but expected may imply 2 (not shown, unknown); also fills row 11 cols 6-11 with 3s unexpectedly.
 * Training 3: Top clues not triggering top 3s (generated starts with 8s in row 0, expected 8s—correct); but overfills upper left rows 7-11 cols 1-6 with full 3s, expected has gaps/partial in row 8; middle section rows 12-17 mostly 8s but expected fills row 17 cols 1-6/16-21 with 3s (underfill); lower far rows 22-26 overfills with 3s via fill_lower_far_two, but expected has shaped 3s only in specific cols.
 * Training 4: Top not filled (correct, starts 8s); middle rows 12-17 overfills cols 1-6 and 11-16 with 3s via fill_middle_left/right, but expected leaves row 17 cols 6-11/16-21 as 8s; lower mid row 18 underfills (generated 8s in cols 1-5, expected 3s?); bottom row 2s correct? but generated has 6s row 5 correct.
 * Training 5: Top filled with 3s unexpectedly (generated row 0 3s, expected 8s—overfill); upper right overfills cols 16-20 rows 8-11 with 3s, expected partial; middle far underfills rows 12-17 cols 16-21 (8s, expected 3s in some); lower left-mid fills row 18 cols 1-11 with 3s correctly? but row 19 cols 16-20 mismatched (generated 3s in gaps).
 * Unhelpful/broken functions: fill_upper_left_specific (hardcodes positions but overfills gaps, e.g., row 8 cols 2/4 as 3s when expected 8s in some cases); fill_lower_far_nine (specific positions but applies unconditionally if is_nine_right, leading to mismatches like filling (18,17) which may not be expected); fill_long_mid (extends too far, e.g., to row 26 when expected stops at 17); fill_bottom (uses 3 always if top conditions, but some expected bottoms are 2s or unfilled—broken logic).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it overfills top rows 0-4 with 3s (expected likely 8s based on training 3/4/5 patterns where top clues like 0/1/9 don't always trigger full top fill); upper mid rows 8-11 cols 6-11 filled fully with 3s, but likely partial or none needed (similar to training 2 underfill issue); middle rows 12-17 cols 1-6 filled but row 12 cols 6-11/16-21 left 8s (underfill, expected shaped based on bottom clues 0/6?); lower far rows 22-26 has partial 3s in cols 16-21 but gaps like row 22 col 17=8 (mismatch, looks like incomplete 'nine' shape); bottom row 29 not shown but implied 3s, may be wrong if test clues suggest 2; overall, too many 3s in left/mid, leaving right/far inconsistent—does not make sense as it ignores negative conditions (e.g., not full_zero_left) and shaped fills.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where fixed digits (0-9, 6's on certain rows) provide clues to fill blank spaces (8's) with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on pattern-matching conditions derived from the positions and combinations of those digits; the goal is to replicate exact expected fillings across training examples, likely simulating rules for shading or completing a hidden image/diagram without over- or under-filling.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are often fully filled with 3's or 2's based on top/bottom conditions; row 5 and 29 are always 6's; rows 6-7 and some lower rows start as 8's but may get filled; the puzzle divides into vertical sections (left: cols 1-6, mid: 6-11, right: 11-21) and horizontal bands (upper: rows 8-12, middle: 12-18/23, lower: 18-28).
 * Filling only occurs where 8's exist—never overwrite non-8 cells; use value 3 for fills, but some conditions lead to 2's (e.g., bottom if no zero/one top).
 * Conditions are conditional and sometimes mutually exclusive: e.g., long vertical mid fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if one in mid AND two far-right; upper far-right fill if mostly 9's in right (not all 8's); bottom far if two far AND no one mid.
 * Subtle overlaps/conflicts: multiple fills can overlap (e.g., middle mid and long mid both target mid section, but order matters to avoid partial fills); some regions like lower left-mid (rows 17-23, cols 1-11) only if four in mid, but this may conflict with other middle fills.
 * Digit detection is row-restricted (e.g., tops in rows 1-4, cols 0-22; mid in rows 1-4, cols 7-11; left in cols 2-5/6; right in cols 12-16/17-21); "full zero left" requires ALL zeros in a subregion, while others are "any" (existence).
 * Easy to miss: "is_nine_right" checks for non-8 cells in right being ALL 9's (not just any 9); no fill if condition partial (e.g., mixed 7/8/9 in right doesn't trigger nine fill); bottom row fill to 2's if no zero AND one top; some examples have pre-filled 3's outside 8's, so program must copy input faithfully.
 * Across attempts: order of fill functions matters (early fills like top/bottom set global, later ones like middle may depend); unhandled cases like pre-existing 3's in input (e.g., training 3 has them in row 7) can cause mismatches if not copied; right section fills are tricky (e.g., seven_right any 7 triggers wide middle right, but nine_right needs purity).
 * General: Puzzle emphasizes precision—small mismatches (e.g., one cell wrong) fail the example; test cases vary in digit placements, so rules must generalize without hardcoding per-example.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training example 1 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 17 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (middle left over-filled, likely due to full_zero_left triggering despite context); also filled row 28-29 with 3's but expected 2's in some spots? Wait, actually bottoms match, but row 17 mismatch suggests middle_left fill ignores upper/middle interactions; subtle: expected has 8's in row 17 left, so condition like full_zero_left may be too broad or misranged (cols 2-5 vs 1-6).
 * Training example 2 CORRECT: All fills matched exactly, indicating core top/bottom, upper left (if two left), long mid (if one mid + two far), upper far (if nine right), middle sections, lower left-mid (if four mid), lower mid (if two mid), and lower far (if two far no one mid) worked perfectly here—likely because this example had clean, non-overlapping conditions without pre-filled 3's.
 * Training example 3 INCORRECT: Generated filled row 7 (cols 1-6) with 3's where expected 8's (upper left triggered wrongly? Input has no two left in rows 1-4? Wait, input row 1-3 have 2's in left, but perhaps range issue); also row 23 (cols 1-6) filled with 3's expected 8's (lower left overreach); row 24 has extra 3's in right where expected 8's (long mid or middle right spillover); bottom rows 30-31 are 2's matching, but upper/middle mismatches suggest mishandling pre-existing 3's in row 7 or incorrect any_two_left detection.
 * Training example 4 INCORRECT: Generated row 17 (cols 1-6 and 6-11) filled with 3's where expected 8's in left-mid (middle left/mid triggered wrongly, perhaps full_zero_left false but still filled? Input has zeros left but not full; also row 18 over-filled); row 22-23 have partial 3's in left where expected 8's (lower left-mid if four mid, but input has no 4 mid? Mismatch unknown); row 24 empty matching, but middle sections differ by entire bands.
 * Training example 5 INCORRECT: Generated row 7 all 8's matching, but row 8 right has 3's interspersed (e.g., col 16-21) where expected none (upper far triggered wrongly—input has 9's in right but mixed with 3's? is_nine_right fails purity); row 12 filled left-mid with 3's expected 8's (middle left/mid over); row 17-18 filled with 3's expected partial; row 23 right has 3's where expected 8's (lower far triggered despite one mid present?); bottoms 3's but input suggests 2's possible.
 * Overall: Works for clean cases (ex 2) but fails on overlaps/pre-fills (ex 3-5) and strict conditions (ex 1,4); fill order helps but misses exclusions (e.g., don't fill if region already partial); no extraction of full objects, but detection funcs are solid—unhelpful: none really broken, but is_nine_right too narrow (cols 12-16 only, misses far-right 17-21); full_zero_left range (2-5) may need tweak to 1-6 for some.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It over-fills row 7 (cols 6-11) with 3's where likely expected 8's (long mid triggered, but input has one mid in rows 1-4 cols 7-11, yet two far present—condition may need stricter check); row 8-11 left/mid/right have 3's interspersed (e.g., cols 1-6,6-11,16-21) matching some upper fills, but cols 12-16 empty where seven_right absent (no 7's, correct no fill); row 12 left empty but mid empty (middle mid if one mid, but perhaps blocked by long mid?); row 17-18 over-filled mid/right with 3's expected partial/empty (middle right if seven, but no 7); row 22-23 left-mid filled if four mid (input has 4's in rows 18-20? Wait, clues in 1-4, but lower detect any_four_mid); row 24-27 right has 3's in cols 16-21 expected empty (lower far if two far no one mid, but one mid present); bottoms 3's due to zero/one top present, seems correct; overall, too many 3's in middle/lower, suggesting program fills without checking for pre-3's or condition negations, and test likely expects sparser fills like training 3/4.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid-based puzzle involving a 30x22 grid of colored cells (numbers 0-9 represent colors, with 8 as background and 3 as green highlight), where the top 5 rows contain a key pattern embedded in 8's, and the goal is to conditionally highlight (fill non-8 cells or backgrounds with 3) matching or similar patterns in designated middle sections (e.g., rows 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27) while setting the bottom 2 rows (28-29) to all 3's or 2's based on whether the top pattern meets a specific criterion (likely exactly 84 eights in the top 5 rows x 22 columns = 110 cells, implying 26 patterned cells). Other rows like dividers (all 6's in row 5, all 8's in some separators) remain unchanged, and the highlighting preserves the internal pattern colors while replacing surrounding 8's with 3's to "frame" or emphasize matches.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top 5 rows (0-4) serve as a key: if they contain exactly 84 eights (measured before any modifications), trigger green (3) filling in the top itself (replacing 8's but preserving non-8 pattern cells) and in matching middle sections; otherwise, leave the top unchanged and selectively green-fill only lower sections that match the key pattern independently.
 * Middle sections are bounded by all-8 or all-6 rows (e.g., rows 6-7 all 8's as separator, row 11 all 8's, row 17 all 8's, row 21-22 all 8's); green-filling typically replaces 8's in columns 1-20 (leaving border 8's in columns 0 and 21 intact) within pattern areas of rows like 7-11, 12-16, 18-22, 23-27, but only for sections whose internal non-8 patterns mirror the top key's shape/structure (e.g., blob-like clusters of 0's, 1's, etc., in similar positions).
 * Bottom rows (28-29) are set to all 3's if the top condition is met (indicating "match found" or "key valid"), otherwise all 2's; this acts as an indicator strip.
 * Subtleties: Patterns are not always fully symmetric or identical—matching may be based on shape topology (e.g., connected components, hole counts, or bounding boxes) rather than exact cell values; in some cases (e.g., train 3,5), top is not green-filled even if patterns exist, suggesting the 84-eight rule applies only to specific key types, while lower sections can be filled independently if they "match" the top regardless of count. Dividers (row 5 all 6's) and separator rows must remain untouched. Borders (columns 0,21) often stay 8 in filled sections for framing. Count eights only in top rows 0-4, columns 0-21, before any changes to avoid state mutation issues.
 * Easy-to-miss: Green-filling in middles is selective per section (e.g., in train 2, only columns 6-10 in rows 7-11 and 23-27 get 3's around a partial match; in train 1, full sections 12-16 filled); not all 8's in a section are replaced—only those surrounding patterns that match the key. In cases like train 3/4/5, top patterns vary (e.g., all-8 top in train 3 means no top fill, but lower matches trigger isolated fills). Internal pattern colors (e.g., 0,1,2,4,6,7,9) must be preserved, not overwritten. The puzzle may involve extracting "objects" (connected non-8 regions) to compare shapes across sections.
 * All rows not mentioned (e.g., 26-27 in some) may need conditional filling based on pattern similarity; test input has a unique top pattern (0's in col 2-4 row1-3, 1's in col7-9/7 row1-3, etc.), suggesting partial matches in lower sections like rows 18-20 or 23-25.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single program attempt across all training examples failed entirely (all marked INCORRECT), primarily due to execution order: greenify_top_if_condition modifies the top (replacing 8's with 3's) before subsequent functions like set_bottom_based_on_top_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition check count_eights_in_top == 84, causing the count to drop below 84 post-modification, so bottom stays 2's (expected 3's in train 1/2) and middles remain unfilled (e.g., row 12 all 8's instead of bordered 3's in train 1).
 * Top greenification worked partially in train 1/2 (correctly replaced 8's with 3's while preserving patterns in rows 0-4), but failed in train 3/4/5 where top should remain unchanged (generated filled with 3's around patterns, but expected keeps original 8-background patterns without 3's, e.g., row 0 all 8's in train 3).
 * Middle filling (rows 12-17, cols 1-20) never triggered due to the mutated count, so sections like rows 12-16 stayed all 8's or original in all trains (e.g., train 1 expected bordered 3's with preserved 7/1/6/0 patterns, but generated all 8's; train 2 expected partial 3's in cols 6-10 rows 7-11/23-27, but generated unchanged).
 * Bottom setting always defaulted to 2's due to failed condition (e.g., train 1/2 expected all 3's, but generated all 2's; train 3/4/5 expected all 2's? but generated all 2's correctly by accident, though other parts wrong).
 * copy_pink_rows was a no-op (just returns copy), unhelpful and irrelevant (no "pink" mentioned, likely a red herring or broken remnant).
 * greenify_top_if_condition and fill_middle_green_if_condition are partially helpful for the filling logic (preserve non-8's, target specific ranges), but broken by not checking condition before modification and lacking pattern matching— they blindly fill all 8's in ranges if condition met, missing selective section-based matching (e.g., train 2 only fills specific columns, not full range).
 * set_bottom_based_on_top_condition is conceptually useful for the indicator but broken by post-modification check; should check original input count.
 * No pattern extraction or matching implemented, leading to over-generalized filling (e.g., train 3 generated top/middle 3's incorrectly, ignoring that top didn't qualify for 84 eights); count_eights_in_top is helpful but must be called on original grid copy.
 * Train 1: Top correct, but middle unfilled (row 12 all 8's vs expected 8-3's-8), bottom 2's vs 3's; patterns in rows 13-15 expected preserved in 3-background but generated unchanged 8's.
 * Train 2: Top correct, but no 3's in rows 7-11/23-27 cols 6-10 (generated unchanged vs expected 3's around partial matches), bottom 2's vs 3's; also missed green in row 7 cols 6-10.
 * Train 3: Top incorrectly green-filled (generated 3's around patterns in rows 0-4 vs expected original 8-background), no selective lower fills (e.g., expected 3's in rows 7-11 cols 2-5/7-10? but generated unchanged); bottom correct by default but overall mismatch.
 * Train 4: Top unchanged correctly (but expected green? wait, no—generated top original, but expected some 3's in row 12-16; actually mismatched as middle unfilled vs expected bordered 3's).
 * Train 5: Top unchanged but expected partial 3's in lower sections (generated no changes vs expected 3's in rows 7-11/17-21 cols 16-20?); patterns mismatched for unknown reason (e.g., row 8 col 16-20 expected 3's around 9's but generated 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output makes no changes to the input grid (top rows 0-4 remain 8-background with patterns like 0's/1's/9's/2's unchanged, no 3's anywhere, bottom all 2's), which does not look correct because the top pattern (e.g., 0's in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, 1's in row 1 cols 7-9 and row 3 cols 7-9, etc.) likely qualifies as a valid key (count 8's to check ~84?), so expected top green-fill (3's replacing 8's around patterns), selective middle green-fills in matching sections (e.g., rows 12-16 or 18-20 may have similar 1/0/6/0 clusters needing 3-borders), and bottom all 3's; instead, it's entirely static, suggesting the condition failed entirely (possibly top count !=84, or order bug prevented any action).
 * No green highlighting in any middle sections (e.g., rows 13-15 have 7/1/6/0 patterns unchanged vs likely expected 3's bordering them if matching top), and bottom 2's vs probable 3's; this ignores potential partial matches (e.g., the 2/0/7/9 in rows 8-10 may not match, but 4/2/5/1 in 18-20 or 9/6/4/2 in 23-25 might).
 * Overall, test output looks incorrect as it treats the grid as "no matches" despite visible similar blob shapes (e.g., triple 0's/1's in top mirroring lower 7's/1's), failing to demonstrate any understanding of selective filling—needs pattern extraction to confirm matches before filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a deductive logic puzzle (possibly a variant of a battleship, nurikabe, or custom fill puzzle) where a grid contains fixed clues (numbers 0-9 representing shapes, counts, or states) and unknowns (8s to be resolved into specific numbers like 2, 3, 6 based on positional rules, band-filling logic, and conditional presence/absence of clues in designated regions). The goal of the program is to apply a sequence of rules to fill only the 8s without altering existing clues, producing a completed grid that matches the expected deductions for each training case.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is 30 rows by 22 columns, with distinct bands/regions: top band (rows 0-4, clues in rows 1-3 cols 22?), middle deduction areas (rows 7-26 in sections like left/mid/right cols 1-6/6-10/11-20), bottom band (rows 28-29), and fixed full rows like row 5/25/30 all 6s, rows 0-4/28-29 often 3s.
 * Rules involve conditional rectangle fills (e.g., fill with 3 if certain clues like 0 and 1 coexist in "top" region cols 22; fill bottom with 3 if top has 0+1, else 2), but order matters—early fills can trigger later ones, and over-filling (e.g., filling non-8s or wrong regions) breaks matches.
 * Subtle clue regions: "top" clues seem in col 22 (rows 1-3), "left" in cols 2-5 (rows 1-3? but code uses 2-5), "mid" cols 7-11, "right" cols 12-16; "far" cols 17-21; avoid filling col 0/21/22 which are often boundaries (8s or fixed).
 * Presence/absence logic: e.g., "full_zero_left" requires all zeros in a subregion; "is_nine_right" checks if non-8s in right are all 9s (not just any 9); "any_two_*" detects 2s in specific zones to trigger extensions.
 * Do not fill non-8s (code has if out[r][c] == 8 check, which is good); some rules are mutually exclusive (e.g., lower far fill only if two far but no one mid).
 * Easy to miss: Top band fill is cols 0-21 (not 22); bottom is always filled but value depends on top condition; upper/middle/lower sections (rows 7-11,12-17,18-22) have parallel left/mid/right fills triggered independently; row 23-24 often untouched or partial; no fills in rows 6/23-27 except specific cases.
 * Grid has vertical/horizontal symmetry in clues but deductions are asymmetric; 3s seem to represent "filled/shaded" states, 2s "partial/empty", 6s boundaries.
 * All attempts fail due to over-filling (e.g., filling where expected is 8) or under-filling (missing triggers); code applies all rules unconditionally after checks, but some rules interact (e.g., upper mid extension only after base fills).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def full_zero_left() -> bool:
    return all(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Checks complete zero in left clue subregion; useful for triggering middle left fill.

def has_zero_top() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Detects 0 in top-right clue column; pairs with has_one_top for band fills.

def has_one_top() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Detects 1 in top-right; key for 3 vs 2 in bottom.

def has_one_mid() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 11))  # Mid clue detection; blocks some lower fills.

def has_seven_right() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16))  # Right clue for middle right fill.

def is_nine_right() -> bool:
    non_eight = [out[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16) if out[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Strict all-9s check (ignores 8s); useful for upper far fill.

def any_two_left() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Triggers upper/lower left fills.

def any_two_far() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(17, 21))  # For upper mid extension and conditional lower far.

def any_two_top() -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Triggers lower mid fill.

def fill_rect(rs: int, re: int, cs: int, ce: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(rs, re + 1):
        for c in range(cs, ce + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Safe fill-only-8s; essential to avoid overwriting clues.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating core rules are incomplete or wrongly ordered; e.g., in Train 1, generated fills row 17 (0-based index 17) with 3s in cols 1-6 where expected keeps 8s (under-filled lower left? No, over-filled mid-left in row 12 where expected has 8s in some spots? Actually, Train 1 generated row 12: full 3s left-mid-right, but expected row 12 has 8s in left and partial 3s only mid-right—over-filled left).
 * Train 1 also incorrectly fills upper mid (rows 7-11 cols 6-10) with 3s due to has_one_mid() and any_two_far(), but expected has 8s there (rule triggers too early or wrongly).
 * Train 2 generated over-fills upper left (rows 7-11 cols 1-6) with 3s from any_two_left(), but expected keeps 8s; also fills bottom with 2s correctly (no 0+1 top), but middle right (rows 12-17 cols 11-20) partial 3s where expected has more 8s.
 * Train 2 mismatches lower far (rows 22-26? code has 22-26 but expected row 23 empty) by not filling due to has_one_mid() blocking, but generated has no fill there while expected has 3s in cols 6-10? Wait, unknown why—possibly rule range wrong (code uses 22-26 for far, but grid shows row 23 as 8s).
 * Train 3 generated fills bottom with 2s (correct, no top 0+1), but over-fills upper left/mid (rows 7-11) with 3s from any_two_left() and is_nine_right(), expected keeps more 8s; also fills row 17 with 3s where expected has 8s in mid.
 * Train 3 lower section (rows 18-22) over-fills left/mid with 3s, but expected row 17 empty in left; row 23 partial 3s in far but code misses (wrong row range for lower far: code 22-26 overlaps empty row 23-24).
 * Train 4 incorrectly fills top band with nothing (keeps 8s in rows 0-4), but expected has no top clues triggering 3s? Wait, input has top 0s/2s, code's has_zero_top() false? Mismatch in col 22 range; also over-fills middle left (rows 12-17 cols 1-6) with 3s from full_zero_left(), expected keeps 8s.
 * Train 4 lower left (rows 18-22 cols 1-6) filled with 3s, but expected row 17 empty; bottom 2s correct.
 * Train 5 over-fills upper (rows 7-11) empty due to no two_left, but fills middle right wrongly; lower mid (rows 18-22 cols 6-10) misses due to no two_top, expected has 3s? Also row 17 filled with 3s where expected empty.
 * Common issue: fill_rect ranges inconsistent (e.g., middle right code 11-20 too wide, expected 12-20?); top fill cols 0-21 includes boundaries; no handling for cases without full_zero_left (Train 4 has partial zeros, doesn't trigger).
 * Function full_zero_left is helpful but too strict (requires all zeros; Train 4 has partial, needs "any_zero_left"?); is_nine_right good but only triggers if no 8s mixed wrong.
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection for connected 8s), but not needed—rules are regional, not global.
 * fill_rect is essential and correct (only 8s), but unhelpful if ranges wrong (e.g., lower far 22-26 includes row 23-24 which should stay 8s).
 * Overall, attempts show partial understanding of band fills (top/bottom often close) but fail on sectional triggers (upper/mid/lower independence) and ranges (over-fill boundaries like col 0/21).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output fills top/bottom bands with 3s (likely from has_zero_top() and has_one_top() detecting 0 and 1 in col 22), which seems plausible if test input has those clues, but without input grid, can't confirm—however, since all trainings failed similar logic, this may over-fill if test lacks full triggers.
 * Middle sections over-filled: e.g., rows 12-17 cols 1-6/6-10/11-20 partial 3s, but based on Train 1/2 patterns, likely mismatches expected 8s in left (no full_zero_left?); upper rows 7-11 cols 1-6 filled from any_two_left(), cols 16-20 from is_nine_right()? But Train 3/4 show this over-fills.
 * Lower rows 18-22 cols 1-6/6-10 filled with 3s (from two_left and two_top?), cols 11-20 not (no seven_right?), but row 23-26 empty except possible far miss; rows 24-26 have no fills, expected likely partial 3s in mid/far per Train 3.
 * Does not look correct: Over-fills middle left (rows 12-17 cols 1-6 all 3s, but Train 1 expected 8s there without full_zero); upper mid partial 3s in cols 6-10/16-20 where Train 2 kept 8s; bottom 3s may be wrong if test top lacks 0+1 pair (Train 2 had 2s correctly). Subtleties like col 22 clues not propagating to col 0 boundaries (generated fills col 0 with 3s, but expected often 8s). Missing conditional blocks (e.g., lower far empty, but if any_two_far() and not has_one_mid(), should fill rows 22-26 cols 16-20 with 3s per code, but output shows 8s—bug in trigger?).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where patterns of colored cells (numbers 0-9 representing colors or empties) in the top panel (rows 1-3, columns 0-21) act as triggers to fill specific regions in the lower panels (rows 4-29, divided into horizontal sections like panels 2-5 and a bottom bar) with a background color (3) or other fills, while preserving or modifying certain art elements; the bottom two rows (28-29) are uniformly filled with 3 or 2 based on top conditions. The goal is to detect exact shapes like "O"s, broken shapes, or color clusters in the top and apply rule-based fills to complete the image without overwriting key elements.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Top panel patterns must be detected precisely by position and shape: e.g., "zero left" requires 0s specifically in rows 1-3, columns 2-4 (not just any 0s); "strict blue O" needs exact 1s in columns 7-9 for rows 1 and 3, plus center at row 2 col 8, but not filling the entire O if it's not strict.
 * Fills with 3 (likely white/background) are conditional and sectional: top full fill only if zero_left AND strict_blue_o; vertical non-blue fills propagate top colors down only if row 2 is 8 and row 3 matches top; third panel (rows 12-16?) fills columns 1-5, 6-10 (if blue O), 11-20 (if seven middle); second/fourth panels (rows 7-11, 18-21) get full middle fills (cols 6-10) only if pink O top (specific 6s and 8s in cols 12-14 rows 1-3).
 * Art-specific fills are hardcoded and fragile: left red (2s in top left) triggers exact pixel fills in second/fourth left panels (cols 1-5, specific positions like row 8 cols 1,3,5=3); lightblue middle (9s with 8s in cols 12-14) fills right second panel gaps; yellow broken O (4s with 8s in cols 7-9) fills fourth middle gaps (cols 6-10 bottom rows).
 * Bottom fill (rows 28-29): 3 only if zero_left AND strict_blue_o, else 2 (darker background?); entire grid starts as copy, only overwrite 8s (blanks?) to 3.
 * Subtleties: Patterns like pink O include internal 8s (holes?) at specific spots (row2 col13=8, row3 col13=8); lightblue has mixed 9/8; yellow has broken top with 8 in middle. Overfills happen if conditions overlap without checks (e.g., filling art areas prematurely). No overwriting of non-8 cells. Grid dimensions: 30 rows x 22 cols, with horizontal dividers (all 6s or 3s in rows 0,4,5,25?,28-29; all 8s in some). Panels seem divided: top (0-4), then sections ~6-11,12-16,17-21,22-27? with vertical-ish columns (left 0-5, middle 6-10, right 11-15/16-20?).
 * Easy to miss: Third panel background fill uses set of columns (1-5 +11-20 if seven, +6-10 if blue O), applied to rows 12-16 only if 8; vertical top fills (rows 1-3 only?) skip blues (1s). No fills in row 22-27 except possibly bottom of fourth panel. Conditions are AND for some (e.g., top full), but independent for others. 0s are empties/holes, not to fill. Right fills (e.g., lightblue) are sparse, not full blocks.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The detection functions in the program are helpful for pattern recognition, as they isolate top triggers cleanly:

```python
def has_zero_left(out) -> bool:
    return any(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))

def has_strict_blue_o(out) -> bool:
    return (all(out[1][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)) and
            all(out[3][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)) and
            out[2][8] == 1)

def has_seven_middle(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][12] == 7 and all(out[2][c] == 7 for c in range(12, 15)) and
            out[3][12] == 7)

def has_pink_o_top(out) -> bool:
    return (all(out[1][c] == 6 for c in range(12, 15)) and
            out[2][12] == 6 and out[2][14] == 6 and
            out[3][12] == 6 and out[3][14] == 6 and
            out[2][13] == 8 and out[3][13] == 8)

def has_red_left(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][2] == 2 and out[1][4] == 2 and
            out[2][3] == 2 and
            out[3][2] == 2 and out[3][4] == 2)

def has_lightblue_middle(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][12] == 9 and out[1][14] == 9 and out[1][13] == 8 and
            out[2][12] == 9 and out[2][13] -> 9 and out[2][14] == 8 and
            all(out[3][c] == 9 for c in range(12, 15)))

def has_yellow_broken_o(out) -> bool:
    return (out[1][7] == 4 and out[1][8] == 8 and out[1][9] == 4 and
            out[2][7] == 4 and out[2][8] == 8 and out[2][9] == 4 and
            all(out[3][c] == 4 for c in range(7, 10)))
```

No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no general blob finder); the hardcoded detectors work for known patterns but miss variations. Column set for third panel fill is useful for modular fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct, so core structure (copy grid, detect top patterns, conditional 3-fills on 8s, bottom uniform fill) works when zero_left + blue O trigger top/full fills and basic verticals.
 * Training 2: Incorrect; generated misses 3-fills in second panel top (row 7 cols 6-10 all 8s instead of 3s), third panel left/right (rows 12-16 cols 1-5/11-20 partial 3s missing), fourth panel middle full (rows 18-21 cols 6-10 has some 3s but incomplete vs expected), and bottom is 3s (correct? but expected has more 3s in panels); overfills nothing obvious, but underfills backgrounds where pink O should trigger second/fourth middles fully.
 * Training 3: Incorrect; generated has wrong top fill (row 1 has 3,2,3 patterns instead of 8s), second panel left overfilled with 3s in cols 1-5 rows 7-11 (expected partial 3s only in row 7), third panel no fills (all 8s in cols 1-10/11-20 rows 12-16, expected 3s), fourth left overfilled similarly, bottom 2s (correct, since no zero_left/blue O); misses red left trigger for sparse art fills, applies full blocks instead.
 * Training 4: Incorrect; generated has third panel overfilled (rows 12-17 cols 0-5/11-21 all 3s, but expected only cols 1-5 partial and middle empty), fourth panel top row 17 all 8s (expected 3s in cols 6-10), pink O detection likely failed (no full middle fills in second/fourth), lightblue right fills missing (row 8-10 cols 16-20 partial 8s vs expected 3s); bottom 2s correct.
 * Training 5: Incorrect; generated misses all panel backgrounds (rows 7-11/12-16/17-21/22-27 all 8s except sparse, expected 3s in left/middle/right sections per triggers like blue O/seven/pink), no art fills (e.g., row 8 cols 17-21 8s vs expected 3s for lightblue), top patterns not triggering (e.g., strict blue O failed? since row 7 cols 6-10 8s); bottom 2s correct (no zero_left).
 * Vertical non-blue fill in top works in some (e.g., training 2 row 2 col 2=0 preserved), but not applied consistently.
 * Hardcoded art fills (e.g., for red left) are position-specific and work only if exact top red matches, but over-applied in training 3/4 without conditions.
 * has_lightblue_middle has a typo (out[2][13] == 9? but code says 9, expected may need 8); not triggered in most.
 * Full top fill (rows 0-4 all 3 on 8s) only if both zero_left AND blue_o, missed in training 3/5.
 * No general object extractor; hardcoded detectors are helpful but brittle for variations (e.g., broken O positions exact).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it resembles training 5's errors: no background 3-fills in any lower panels (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 6-10 all 8s, but top has blue O-ish 1s in cols 7-9 and zero left 0s in cols 2-4, so should trigger top full fill (rows 0-4 cols all to 3 on 8s) and third panel middles (cols 6-10 rows 12-16 to 3), plus bottom to 3s; instead bottom is 2s (wrong, since zero_left true and blue_o partial but strict check likely failed due to row 2 cols 7/9=1? wait, test top row2: 1,1,8? no, cols7-9 row2=1,1,8? output shows row1 (second list):1,8,1? wait, [8,8,0,0,0,8,8,1,8,1,8,...] so row1 cols7-9:1,8,1 (not all 1s), row2:1,1,8 (not 3,1,3 or strict), row3:1,8,1; so strict_blue_o false (needs all 1s in sides + center 1), zero_left true, so no top full, no bottom 3 (correctly 2), but misses other triggers like pink? top cols12-14: row1 9,8,9; row2 9,9,3 (not 6s/8s); seven? no; red left? row1 cols2/4=0 not 2; lightblue partial but not exact (row1 col13=8 ok, but row2 col14=3 not 8); yellow? cols7-9 row1:1,8,1 not 4,8,4. So minimal triggers, but generated still has no fills where vertical non-blue should apply (e.g., row2 col18-19=2,2 but if top row1 col18=2, row3=2? test row3 cols18-20=2,2,2, row2=2,3,2 so partial), and third panel empty (should fill cols1-5/11-20 if seven, but no seven). Overall, underfills everything, preserving too many 8s; expected likely has some 3s in left/right thirds per rules, and test fails strict detections leading to blank panels.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) where specific colored shapes or patterns (represented by numbers like 1 for blue, 2 for red, 6 for pink, etc.) trigger conditional filling of blank spaces (8s) with a fill color (3, possibly green or neutral). The program processes the grid top-to-bottom, detecting patterns in upper, middle, and lower sections to apply fills in targeted areas, simulating rules like object recognition and propagation of fills based on presence/absence of shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural elements: rows 0-4 and 24-29 often contain full lines of 3s or 6s/bottom fills (e.g., bottom two rows always filled with 2 or 3 based on top patterns); rows 5-6 and 25? are full 6s; many rows have 8s as blanks to fill only conditionally.
 * Pattern detection is localized: e.g., upper section (rows 1-3, cols 7-9 for "blue H" as [1,1,1]/[8,1,8]/[1,1,1]); middle sections have U/C shapes in cols 1-20, rows 7-11 or 12-16; lower sections (rows 17-21) have bowtie/partial fills triggered by red (2) or lightblue (9) presences.
 * Fills are selective: Only replace 8s with 3s in specific positions (e.g., full rows, sides, partial shapes); never overwrite non-8s; order matters (top fills first, then middle, then lower).
 * Subtleties: "Top filled" (blue H) changes bottom color from 2 to 3 and enables broader fills; left 0s (blanks?) in rows 1-3 cols 2-4 trigger partial lower fills only if not full; red presence anywhere in certain col ranges triggers "red fills" but varies by top_filled state; lightblue C enables right-side partials; blue in middle-left (any 1 in rows 1-4? cols 7-9) triggers middle fills.
 * Easy to miss: Fills can overlap sections (e.g., upper fills propagate to row 5? but code shows rows 0-4? wait, code has range(5) for top); not all 8s fill—e.g., row 21 fills conditionally by section (left/mid/right); row 17 red fill depends on top_filled XOR red location; full left 0s + top_filled enables huge lower fill (rows 12-16, cols 1-20); partial 0 logic is nested (any0 but not full0 fills only sides at row 14 cols 1,5).
 * Bottom fill: Always rows 28-29 with 3 if top_filled, else 2; but in ex3/4/5 generated shows 2s, expected also 2s sometimes—suggests top_filled false in those.
 * No fills in some areas: e.g., rows 7-8 often remain 8s unless upper/middle triggers; row 12 sometimes fills fully if conditions met.
 * Colors: 0=empty/white, 1=blue, 2=red, 3=fill/green?, 4=orange?, 5=yellow?, 6=pink, 7=purple?, 9=lightblue; 8=blank to fill.

These detector functions are helpful for identifying trigger patterns (e.g., shapes like H/U/C/bowtie) in specific grid regions; they return booleans for conditional logic. The main program uses them to apply targeted 3-fills on 8s.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Correct overall—likely because it had blue H trigger (rows 1-3 cols 7-9 as [1,1,1]/[3,1,3]? wait, code fills 8s to 3 post-detect, but input had proper 1s; bottom filled 3s; middle/lower partials matched expected.
 * Training 2: Incorrect—generated has row7 cols6-10 as 3s (from pink U? but expected row7 empty 8s); row8 cols0-5 as 8s/2s but expected 3s in left (missed upper fill prop?); row11 cols6-10 as 3s but expected empty; row12 empty but expected full 3s left/mid/right?; row14 col5 as 8 but expected 3? (partial 0 logic failed); row23 full 3s but expected empty 8s; row24 has 3s in left/mid but expected full 3s everywhere? (bottom fill wrong, top_filled false but should be true?); subtle: generated row9 col2=8 expected 3 (left fill miss); unknown why row17 empty when expected empty but row18-20 partials mismatch (e.g., generated row18 col2=4 not 3).
 * Training 3: Incorrect—generated row7 empty (good) but row11 cols0-5 as 3s expected empty; row12 empty expected empty (good); row17 empty expected full left 3s? no, expected row17 empty but row18 cols0-5 as 3s/4s, generated has 3s in left but overwrote non-8s?; bottom rows 28-29=2 good, but row24 empty expected full 3s in right? wait no, expected row24 has 3s only in right cols16-20; big miss: generated no fills in row8 (expected full left 3s cols0-5); row21 cols16-20 empty expected 3s (lightblue C trigger failed); row22 empty good; unknown why row18-20 left partials have 3s on non-8s like 4s.
 * Training 4: Incorrect—generated row12 cols11-20 as 3s but expected empty 8s (overfill mid/right); row13 col11=3 expected empty; row14 cols12-13=3,6 expected 3, empty? (fill prop wrong); row15 col12=3 expected empty; row16 full 3s expected empty; row17 empty good; but row18-21 partials mismatch (e.g., generated row18 cols0-5 empty expected 3s); bottom 2s good; subtle: left 0s full but no top_filled, so partial sides only, but code overfilled mid; unknown why row13 left has 3,7,3 but expected 3s more broadly.
 * Training 5: Incorrect—generated row7 empty good but expected full 3s cols16-20 (lightblue? but input has 9s in cols12-14 rows1-3); row8 cols16-20=3s expected full 3s; row12 empty expected empty; row17 empty expected full 3s cols16-20; row18 cols16-20=3s/1s but expected empty/non-fill; big miss: no upper fills in row7-8 right (C trigger not prop to row7); row21 cols16-20 empty expected 3s; unknown why row9-11 right has 3s on 9s (overwrote colors).
 * Overall: Detectors like has_pink_u/has_red_u work for mid fills (e.g., train2 pink triggered row7 3s correctly but over-applied); has_full_left_0 good for detecting but nested logic for partial fills (if any0 and not full0) fails in train2/4 (misses side 3s); top_filled prop to bottom color works (train1=3, others=2); red bowtie/left detectors underused—train3 has bowtie but no left row21 fill?; has_red_top_* any-in-range is too broad, causes false triggers (e.g., train5 red right but no mid fill); lightblue_c detects but partial right fills miss in train3/5 (e.g., no row21 right 3s); unhelpful: No general extract_objects—detectors are hardcoded positions, brittle for variations; has_blue_in_middle_left range(1,4) but grid rows start 0, may miss row0.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—mentally, input has full left 0s (rows1-3 cols2-4 all 0), blue? no (cols7-9 has 1s but not H shape—row1 [1,8,1]? wait input row1 cols7-9=1,8,1? no, code checks [1,1,1] etc., so top_filled false; pink? no, cols12-14 row1=9,8,9 not 6s; red_u no; lightblue_c yes (row1 [9,8,9], row2 [9,9,8], row3 [9,9,9]); left 0s full so partial lower sides (rows13-15 cols1,5=3); blue_in_mid_left? row1-3 cols7-9 has 1s yes, so mid rows12-16 cols6-10=3; red top right yes (row1-3 cols17-19 has 2s), so fill_red true, row21 cols6-10=3, partial rows18-20 red pos=3, row17 mid if not top_filled and red mid left? red mid left no (cols7-9=1s), so no row17; lightblue_c so right partial rows18-20 and row21 cols16-20=3; bottom=2 since no top; but generated has row12-16 full 3s cols0-20 (overfill, should be only mid cols6-10 + sides); row13 left=3,7,3 good partial but col6-10=3 good, but cols11-15/16-20=3 wrong (no trigger); row17 empty good; row18 left empty wrong (full0 no top so sides only rows13/15 cols1,5 + row14 cols1,5, but row18 no); row21 full left/mid/right 3s but left? no bowtie (cols2-4=0 not 2/8/2), so only mid/right; row7-11 empty good (no upper pink/red/lightblue prop? wait lightblue_c should fill pos like (8,16)(8,18)(8,20) etc. to 3, but generated row8-10 cols16-20 empty/mixed, wrong—code has if has_lightblue_c: pos=[(8,16),(8,18),(8,20),...] =3, but in generated row8 col16=8 not 3); also row24 empty wrong, should be 8s (no lower trigger for full); overall, overfills lower mid/right without triggers, misses lightblue partials in upper mid-right, suggests broken full_lower_fill (full0 true but top_filled false, code has full_lower_fill = full0 and top_filled, so false good, but then blue_trigger true so mid fill good, but why full row12-16? code if blue_trigger: rows12-17 cols6-11=3, but generated cols0-20, bug in range? wait code range(12,17) cols(6,11), but output shows broader—perhaps copy error or logic leak.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) that represents segmented or patterned images (possibly digits or shapes formed by numbers like 0-9), where the task is to process the input grid by selectively replacing background '8's with '3's in specific regions based on "clue" patterns detected in the top rows (1-3), effectively completing or outlining puzzle elements while preserving borders, non-background areas, and certain columns (e.g., the rightmost column often remains '8'). The bottom rows (28-29) are uniformly set to '2' or '3' based on top clues, and the program must avoid over-filling or misapplying changes that alter expected preserved '8's or digit shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top rows (1-3) contain clue digits (e.g., 0,1,2,6,7,9) in specific column ranges: left (c=2-5 for 0/2), mid (c=7-10 for 1), center-right (c=12-15 for 7/6/9), far-right (c=17-21 for 2/6). These trigger conditional filling of '8's to '3's in vertical/horizontal strips below (e.g., rows 7-26 in columns 6-11 for mid-1, or full-width rows 12-17 for certain combos like left-0 + center-7).
 * Filling is region-specific and not always full-width: e.g., left regions (c=1-6) for left clues, mid (c=6-11), right (c=16-20), avoiding c=0/21 (borders stay '8'). Subtle: some fills stop short (e.g., row 12 in train 1 expected ends with '8' at c=21, not '3'); combos like top-0+1 trigger broad fills (e.g., rows 5/28-29 to '3', row 6 untouched), while isolated 2's trigger '2' bottoms and partial fills.
 * Bottom rows (28-29) default to '2', but switch to '3' if top has both 0 and 1 anywhere (across c=0-21); row 30-31? Wait, grids show 30 rows, but code uses 28-29—possible off-by-one. Preserve digit shapes: never change non-8's (e.g., keep 0/1/2/4/5/6/7/9 intact in their positions).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Fills are only on '8's (not overwriting digits); some regions overlap (e.g., mid-fill after left); right-side logic (e.g., all-9 in c=12-15 triggers row 21 c=16-20 to '3'); no fill if conditions not met (e.g., train 3 has top-2/4, leading to partial '3's only in specific strips, bottoms '2'); borders (c=0/21, some rows) stay '8'; vertical strips vary by clue (e.g., left-2 triggers rows 7-11/18-22 c=1-6, but not full height).
 * Across attempts: Code checks top for any() presence but re-checks after initial changes, risking order-dependency; misses precise width (e.g., mid c=7-10 clues fill c=6-11 but sometimes only to c=10); ignores some combos (e.g., train 5 top-1/9 no broad fill); bottoms incorrectly '3' when top lacks 0+1; over-fills right column c=21 to '3' when expected '8'.
 * General: Grid has fixed layers (e.g., row 5/6 always 6's? No, varies; row 0/4/30? All 3's in some, 8's/2's in others); puzzle may simulate "drawing" borders around detected digit clues.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No separate functions in the provided code; it's a monolithic if-chain with any() checks on top rows. Helpful would be modular detectors:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def detect_top_clues(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    """Extract presence of digits in top rows (1-3) by column ranges."""
    clues = {
        'zero_left': any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(2,6)),
        'one_mid': any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(7,11)),
        'two_left': any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(2,6)),
        'two_far': any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(17,22)),
        'seven_right': any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(12,16)),
        'nine_right': all(g[r][c] == 9 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(12,16) if g[r][c] != 8),
        'has_zero_top': any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(22)),
        'has_one_top': any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(22)),
        'two_top': any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1,4) for c in range(22)),
    }
    return clues

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols: range, value: int):
    """Safely fill '8's in a rectangular region with value (e.g., 3), preserving non-8's and borders."""
    for r in rows:
        for c in cols:
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = value
    # Note: Explicitly avoid c=0 and c=21 unless specified.

def set_bottom_rows(out: List[List[int]], clues: dict):
    """Set rows 28-29 based on top clues."""
    if clues['has_zero_top'] and clues['has_one_top']:
        for r in range(28, 30):
            for c in range(22):  # But expected often keeps c=21 as 8? Check per case.
                out[r][c] = 3
    else:
        for r in range(28, 30):
            for c in range(22):
                out[r][c] = 2
```

These would help modularize the code, avoid re-checking modified grids, and ensure precise ranges (e.g., cols=range(1,21) to skip borders).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating incomplete understanding of conditional filling rules and region boundaries.
 * Train 1: Generated over-filled row 12 with all 3's (including c=21=3), but expected [8,3's up to c=20,8]; rows 13-16/17 have c=21=3 but expected 8; rows 18-21/22-27 correct but bottoms row 28-29 all 3's match expected; missed preserving right border '8's in left/mid fills; any_two_top logic filled extra in rows 18-22 c=6-11 unnecessarily? (unknown why, but differs).
 * Train 2: Generated 3's in row 7 c=6-11, but expected c=6-10 only (c=11=8); similar over-fill in rows 11-17/18-22/23-27 c=6-11/1-6; row 7 c=6-11 has extra 3 at c=11; bottoms all 3's but expected 3's? Wait, expected bottoms 3's but with c=21=8? No, expected all 3's but code filled full; left/mid fills too wide, missing narrow mid (c=7-10 clue -> c=6-10 fill).
 * Train 3: Generated bottoms row 28-29 all 2's (correct), but over-filled row 7 c=6? No, row 7 all 8's but expected 3's c=0-5? Wait, expected row 7 [8,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] but generated all 8's except some; row 23 has 3's c=16-20 but expected 8's; row 24-26 have 3's in c=0-5/16-20 but expected 8's there; missed top-2/4 triggering narrow left fills (rows 7-11 c=1-5 to 3) and no mid fill; function-like any() checks worked for bottoms but failed region precision.
 * Train 4: Generated row 12 all 3's (c=0-21), but expected [8,3's c=1-20? Wait, expected [8,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8] — irregular, 3's in c=1-5,11-20; code filled uniform strip rows 12-17 c=1-21 to 3, over-filling c=6-10/21 and missing pattern; row 18 all 3's c=1-21 but expected partial; bottoms 2's correct for no 0+1 top.
 * Train 5: Generated row 7 all 8's, but expected [8,8,8,8,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] (3's c=6-10 for mid-1?); row 12 [8,8,8,...3's c=6-10,8's] but generated uniform 3's c=6-10; over-filled row 21 c=16-20 to 3? Expected partial; bottoms 2's but top has 1+9 (no 0), expected 2's correct; missed narrow fills for isolated 1/9 (e.g., rows 12-17 no fill, but row 7 mid yes).
 * Overall: Code's broad for r in range(7,27) / c=6-11 fills too wide/deep (e.g., includes c=11/21); order of ifs causes cascading over-fills (e.g., has_one_mid after initial changes); non_eight_right check buggy (len>0 and all 9's triggers row 21 c=16-20, but in train1 with 7's it didn't trigger correctly?); any_two_top fills rows 18-22/23? c=6-11 even without mid; no handling for top-4/5/9 specifics (e.g., train3/5 have them but fills mismatch); unhelpful: direct any() on modified out (changes mid-checks); row_end=22/23 logic unclear/broken (fills to row 22 or 23, but expected varies); the monolithic structure makes debugging hard—break into detect/fill.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it over-applies 3's similar to train 1/2 failures (e.g., row 12 all 3's including c=21=3, but likely expected c=21=8 based on pattern; rows 13-16 c=21=3 vs expected 8; row 7 3's c=6-11 but probably should be c=6-10 only for mid-1 clue; bottoms row 28-29 all 3's, correct only if top has 0+1 which it does (0 left,1 mid), but c=21 likely 8; row 1 has 1 at c=8/9? But generated 1,3,1 — wait, input not shown but output has irregular 1's/3's in top mid, suggesting code modified top incorrectly? No, code copies out = [row[:]...], but fills only below—top should be preserved, but output shows top row1 [3,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,9,...] with extra 3's in mid, implying bug in clue detection or unintended top fill (unknown why, but differs from expected preservation). It partially handles 0+1+9+2 combo (broad fills + right 9-check?), but misses border preservation and narrow widths, making it inconsistent with train expectations (e.g., no uniform strips for 9-right like row 21 partial).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where the input grid contains digits 0-9 representing drawn shapes or patterns (like letters or symbols formed by connected numbers), and 8's represent unfilled blanks that need to be completed by filling with 3's (for full panels or areas) or 2's (for partial or bottom sections) based on pattern recognition in specific 3x3 subgrids across top, middle, and bottom panels. The goal is to detect symbolic patterns (e.g., H, T, or other letter-like forms) in horizontal strips of subgrids to trigger area fills, while handling special cases like vertical extensions or conditional bottom fills.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid is divided into panels: top (rows 0-4, all columns filled with 3's under certain conditions), middle panels (rows ~7-26, divided into left/middle-right sections with base columns at 2,7,12,17 for 3x3 subgrid extraction starting at row 1), and bottom (rows 28-29, filled with 3's or 2's based on top patterns).
 * Subgrids are 3x3 extracted from specific positions (e.g., left: rows 1-3 cols 2-4; middle-left: cols 7-9, etc.), and patterns are matched exactly as tuples (e.g., full H1: ((1,1,1),(8,1,8),(1,1,1)); T7: ((7,8,8),(7,7,7),(7,8,8))).
 * Core rule: If left subgrid is only 0's and 8's AND middle-left is only 1's and 8's, fill top panel and bottom with 3's; else fill bottom with 2's—subtlety: this is a global trigger, but overrides don't always apply correctly in mixed cases.
 * Special cases for "panel 2" (middle rows 12-17? cols 1-20): Exact set match of three specific patterns (T7 left, H1 middle-left, small6 middle-right) triggers full fill with 3's; vertical middle-left fill (rows 7-27, cols 6-11) only if left is 0/8 and middle-left is full H1.
 * Additional specials: If middle-right is T7, fill panel2 left area (rows 12-17, cols 1-6) with 3's; if right is small6 ((8,6,6),(8,6,8),(8,6,6)), fill panel2 middle-right and right areas (cols 11-16 and 16-21).
 * For non-0/8 left subgrids, fallback to individual pattern matching across 3 panels (top/middle/bottom strips at base rows 8,13,18), with fixed patterns per panel (e.g., panel1 has bowtie2, empty0, etc.; panel3 has pyramid4, etc.) triggering 5x5 area fills (row base-1 to +4, col base-1 to +4) only where 8's exist.
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Fills only replace 8's (not overwrite existing numbers); area bounds are clamped to 0-21 rows/cols; bottom fill choice (2 vs 3) depends on top patterns but can be overridden; patterns must match exactly, including 8 positions; no fill in row 5-6 or 30? (always 6's?); panel2 specials can overlap or conflict with individual matches; vertical fills are narrow (cols 6-11) and long (rows 7-27).
 * Global: Out copies input, fills are conditional and non-destructive to non-8's; empty patterns like ((0,0,0),(0,0,0),(0,0,0)) in panel2 may trigger nothing; top row 0 and bottom rows 28-29 are uniform fills.
 * Considerations across attempts: Patterns are letter/symbol-like (e.g., 7=T, 1=H, 6=small E?, 2=bowtie/Z, 4=pyramid/A, 9=box, 0=empty/dot); connected components implied but not explicitly checked (code uses exact tuple matches); order of conditions matters (e.g., global top/bottom before specials before individual); incomplete fills leave 8's, which is wrong if expected to be filled.

These are useful for extracting and checking 3x3 subgrids at fixed positions (e.g., top row patterns at r_start=1, c_starts=2,7,12,17) and converting to immutable tuples for set/exact matching; they correctly identify empty-ish (0/8) or specific symbol (1/8) regions without overcomplicating connectivity.

```python
def fill_area(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int):
    r_start = max(0, r_start)
    r_end = min(22, r_end)  # Note: grid is 22 cols, but rows up to 29?
    c_start = max(0, c_start)
    c_end = min(22, c_end)
    for r in range(r_start, r_end):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = 3
```
Helpful for targeted 8-replacements in rectangular areas (e.g., 5x5 for individual patterns, full panels for globals); clamping prevents index errors, but row min/max seems off (grid has 30 rows, but code uses min(22,r_end)—likely a bug, as outputs show 30 rows with bottom at 28-29).

The following functions are broken or not helpful: fill_top_panel (fills rows 0-4 cols 0-21 with 3's overwriting 8's, but should check bounds/conditions better); fill_bottom_3 and fill_bottom_2 (fill only rows 28-29, but grid has 30 rows—row 30? is missing or always 3's?); fill_entire_panel2 (fills rows 12-18 cols 1-21, but overlaps and may overfill); fill_vertical_middle_left (fills rows 7-27 cols 6-11, narrow but long—useful but triggers too broadly in some cases). These are panel-specific and rigid; avoid in future without generalization.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1 (INCORRECT): Generated overfilled middle panel1 (e.g., rows 7-11 cols 6-10 with 3's where expected 8's; row 7 all 8's except left; panel2 row 11 cols 12-17 filled 3's but expected 8's; panel3 rows 17-21 no fills but expected some 8's to 3's?); bottom rows 28-29 correctly 3's; top correct. Differences: Extra 3's in middle-left (cols 6-10 rows 7-11) and panel2 edges; missed panel3 fills (e.g., row 16 cols 12-16 should be 8's per expected).
 * Training 2 (CORRECT): All fills matched exactly—no differences noted, suggesting global top/bottom trigger and individual pattern matches worked perfectly for this case's patterns (likely only 0/8 left + 1/8 middle-left, plus matching fixed patterns without specials conflicting).
 * Training 3 (INCORRECT): Generated filled panel2 bottom (rows 28-29 with 2's, but expected 2's only partially? Wait, expected has 2's bottom but generated also has extra 3's in panel3 rows 16-21 cols 16-21?); top panel1 rows 7-11 left filled 3's but expected 8's in middle; panel4? row 21 partial 3's but expected full 8's row 21. Differences: Bottom uniform 2's but expected mixed/partial; overfilled panel2 left (rows 7-11 cols 1-5 with 3's, expected 8's); missed vertical in middle-right; row 16 cols 16-21 3's where expected 8's.
 * Training 4 (INCORRECT): Generated no fills in panel2 middle (rows 12-16 all 8's except patterns, but expected 3's in cols 11-21 rows 12-16); bottom 2's but expected 3's in panel2; top panel1 correct but panel3 rows 17-21 no 3's in cols 0-5/11-15. Differences: Missed panel2 fills entirely (e.g., rows 12-16 cols 0-10 8's expected 3's?); bottom uniform 2's vs expected 3's; individual matches failed for panel3 (e.g., row 12 cols 11-15 3's missing).
 * Training 5 (INCORRECT): Generated partial 3's in top extensions (e.g., row 7 cols 16-21 3's but expected 8's); panel2 overfilled vertically (rows 7-11 cols 16-21 3's, expected 8's); bottom 2's but expected 3's; panel3 rows 17-21 cols 16-21 3's where expected partial. Differences: Extra vertical 3's in right sections (rows 7-11/16-20 cols 16-21); missed H1 extensions in middle-left; top patterns triggered wrong bottom (2's vs 3's); individual fallback over-applied to non-8 areas.
 * Overall: Global condition (0/8 + 1/8) works when true (e.g., train2) but fails to propagate fills correctly in mixed cases (trains 1,3,4); panel2 set-match rarely triggers (missed in 3,4,5); individual pattern matching buggy (wrong base rows/cols, e.g., base_rows=[8,13,18] but fills row-1 to +4 overshoot; fixed_patterns lists incomplete or mismatched for some symbols like 9/box); order of ifs causes specials to skip (e.g., vertical after set but before individual); no handling for row 30? (outputs show 30 rows, but code may cap at 22); extract_subgrid essential but fixed positions miss vertical/off-horizontal patterns.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 filled 3's correctly per global 0/8 left + partial 1/8 middle-left trigger; middle panel1 rows 7-11 patterns preserved with no overfill; panel3 rows 17-21 patterns intact with 8's unfilled as expected for non-match; bottom uniform 3's fits if top qualifies) but does not look fully correct—middle-left rows 12-16 cols 6-10 have 3's filling 8's around 1's (suggesting H1 vertical trigger), but right cols 12-16 rows 12-16 unfilled 8's around 9's (missed individual match for panel2 9-pattern? expected 3's there?); top row1 cols 7-11 has 1,3,1 instead of all 1/8 (overfilled 8's to 3's prematurely); panel4? rows 22-26 all 8's except patterns, but expected partial 3's in cols 16-21 for 2-pattern extension (generated has them as 8's). Unknown why row 1 middle-left overfills to 3's (possible bug in fill_area clamping or order); overall, ~70% filled correctly but misses panel2/3 individual fills and has subtle overfills, so likely incorrect without expected grid to confirm—needs better pattern tuple matching for 9/2 symbols and vertical propagation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a grid (likely 31 rows by 22 columns, with numbers like 0,1,2,3 representing colors or states and 8 as blanks to fill), where patterns in the top panel (rows 1-4) trigger rules to fill blanks in middle and bottom sections with color 3 (or sometimes 2). The goal is to derive and apply conditional filling rules based on observed shapes and presences in the top, propagating to form connected or matching structures below.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top panel (rows 1-4, columns varying by section like 2-5 for left, 7-10 for middle left, 12-15 for middle right, 17-20 for right) contains diagnostic patterns (e.g., full "blue U" as three 1s in rows 1 and 3 cols 7-9 plus row 2 col 8; full 0 bar as all 0s in rows 1-3 cols 2-4) that act as triggers for filling entire shapes or connections in middle (rows 7-22) and bottom (rows 22-31).
 * Subtle elements include conditional negations (e.g., fill only if top has 1s but NOT full 0 bar), specific partial fills (e.g., around 7s in row 14 adjacent to blanks, or targeted positions like row 9 cols 6/10 for 0s shape), and connections (e.g., row 14 cols 11-20 as a bridge between sections).
 * Blanks (8s) are filled selectively only where they match the triggered shape, without overwriting existing numbers; bottom filling can be color 2 or 3 based on top U presence.
 * Grid boundaries must be respected—assuming fixed 31x22 size, but errors suggest possible variation or 0-indexing mismatches (e.g., rows 0-30, cols 0-21).
 * Rules are hierarchical/dependent (e.g., rule 9 requires full U and not 0 bar, overlapping with others like rule 5), so order matters to avoid over-filling; some rules (like 13) are placeholders for covered cases.
 * Easy to miss: presence checks (e.g., "has_top_left_2" scans for 2 in cols 2-4 rows 1-3) are loose (any occurrence triggers), not exact positions; bottom is uniformly filled across all 22 cols but only in rows 28-30; no filling in row 0 or top itself except rule 1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Helper for full blue U in top middle left (rows 1-3, specific cols 7-10)
def has_full_blue_u_top(out):
    return (out[1][7:10] == [1, 1, 1] and
            out[2][8] == 1 and
            out[3][7:10] == [1, 1, 1])
```
```python
# Helper for full 0 bar in top left (rows 1-3, cols 2-4)
def has_full_0_bar_top(out):
    return all(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))
```
```python
# Presence checker for top left 1s (any 1 in rows 1-3, any col)
def has_top_1s(out):
    for r in range(1, 4):
        if 1 in out[r]:
            return True
    return False
```
```python
# General filling utility (used in many rules: fill 8s in specified row ranges/cols with 3)
def fill_region(out, rows_range, cols_range):
    for r in rows_range:
        new_row = out[r][:]
        for c in cols_range:
            if new_row[c] == 8:
                new_row[c] = 3
        out[r] = new_row
# Note: This is a suggested refactor; original code inlines similar logic repeatedly.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt defines 13 detailed rules based on top patterns triggering middle/bottom fills, showing good understanding of puzzle structure (e.g., U shapes, bars, presences of digits like 1,2,4,6,9), but all executions fail with "list assignment index out of range" errors, likely due to assuming fixed grid size (e.g., accessing row 30 or col 21 on smaller inputs).
 * What worked: Rule logic captures many dependencies (e.g., conditional not full 0 bar, targeted positions like row 8 cols 16/18/20 for 9s shape), and helpers like has_full_blue_u_top accurately detect key triggers; bottom uniform fill in rows 28-30 cols 0-21 is correctly color-dependent.
 * What didn't work: Crashes prevent any output generation, so no fills occur; over-assumes grid dimensions (e.g., [bottom_color] * 22 sets full row but may exceed input width; accesses like out[3][7:10] fail if rows/cols shorter); no bounds checking or dynamic size detection.
 * Rule order may cause overlaps (e.g., rule 9 fills row 14 cols 11-20, potentially conflicting with rule 5's adjacent fills), but untestable due to errors.
 * No object extraction functions attempted (e.g., no helpers to identify shapes like U or bars beyond simple checks), which could help generalize but isn't essential if rules are hardcoded.
 * Helpers like has_top_middle_right_9 and has_top_left_2 are specific and useful for triggers but brittle (e.g., scan entire row slice for presence, which works if patterns are isolated).
 * The pass in rule 13 is a placeholder noting coverage by rule 9, which is fine but highlights redundancy.
 * Overall, problem understanding is partial: rules seem derived from training visuals, but implementation ignores potential input variations, leading to total failure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("list assignment index out of range"), so no grid is generated and it does not make sense or look correct—expected a filled grid with 8s replaced by 3s (or 2s) in pattern-matching regions, but crashes prevent evaluation.
 * Likely mismatch: code assumes at least 31 rows (accesses row 30) and 22 cols (e.g., out[r] = [bottom_color] * 22), but test input may have fewer (e.g., 20x20 or variable), causing index errors on assignment or slicing (e.g., out[1][7:10] if col <10).
 * Without output, can't confirm if fills would match expected (e.g., if test has top full U, should fill top rows 0-4 with 3s over 8s and bottom rows 28-30 fully with 3s), but errors mean it doesn't handle test case at all.
 * To fix for test: Add grid size checks (e.g., rows = len(g), cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0; clip ranges to min(rows,31), etc.) and avoid full-row assignments.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) where cells contain color codes (integers like 0 for empty, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc., up to 9) and 8 as a placeholder to be filled based on patterns or rules derived from the top section of the grid (roughly rows 0-4). The goal is to fill 8's in specific regions of the middle section (rows ~7-27) with 3 (green) according to structural or conditional rules (e.g., based on top colors, zero counts, or special configurations), while setting the bottom two rows (28-29) to either all 3 (green) or all 2 (red) depending on whether the top qualifies as "special." Fixed rows like 5 and 25 are all 6's (possibly a separator or background), and edges are often 8's that may or may not get filled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top section (rows 0-4) determines overall behavior: count of 8's in rows 0-4 (special if exactly 84), count of 0's in rows 1-3 (e.g., ==9 triggers specific fills), and set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3 (e.g., {2,4} or {1,9} triggers region-specific fills).
 * Bottom rows 28-29 are uniformly set to 3 if top is special (fill_top_with_green also applies), else to 2; this is consistent across examples but overrides other logic.
 * Middle fills target 8's only, preserving existing colors/0's; regions include vertical strips (e.g., cols 6-10 rows 7-17), partial rows (e.g., row 12 and 16 cols 1-20, with specific cols in 13-15), and "train"-like areas (e.g., left/bottom-right blobs filled conditionally).
 * Subtleties: Fills are not global—e.g., fill_full_second fills rows 12-17 cols 1-20 completely if conditions met, but fill_partial_second is more selective (top/bottom of that block + specific cols); vertical_middle is a narrow strip; train3_regions fills three disconnected areas (left upper, bottom-left middle, bottom-right lower); train5_regions fills two vertical-ish areas. Existing non-8 cells (e.g., 0's, colors) block or pattern-match fills.
 * Easy to miss: Top colors exclude 0/8 but include scattered non-8's that form patterns (e.g., blobs of 1's, 2's); zeros==9 suggests a specific sparse top pattern. Special check is row-limited (only top 5 rows, all cols). Edges (col 0/21) often remain 8 or get partial fills. Fixed rows (5,25 all 6's; sometimes top/bottom all 8's or 3's) must not be altered. Bottom green requires special=true, but red is default.
 * Across attempts: Program applies fills sequentially but conditionally (if special then green bottom + top fill, else red bottom); then nested ifs for middle based on zeros/special/colors, with else fallback to partial_second. This works for ex1 but overfills or underfills regions in others (e.g., filling where expected is 8 or different color). No rotation/flipping; assumes grid is oriented with patterns like "trains" or blobs in fixed positions.
 * Considerations: Patterns in top/middle suggest object detection (e.g., connected components of same color), but current code uses hardcoded regions—may miss dynamic shapes. 8's are fillers, but some expected outputs leave 8's unfilled (e.g., ex3 top is all 8's, not filled). Bottom red in ex3/4/5 but generated green in some. Test input has mixed top (0's and colors like 1,9,2), suggesting partial_second or train logic, but generated fills middle with green in wrong spots.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_special(grid):  # Checks for exactly 84 eights in top 5 rows (all cols)—useful for green bottom/top fill trigger.
    count = 0
    for r in range(5):
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:

    for r in range(5):  # Actually only top 5 rows in code, despite name.
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                grid[r][c] = 3

def fill_train5_regions(grid):  # Two areas: rows 7-16 cols 6-10; 17-21 cols 16-20.
    # ... (as in code)
```
Note: No object extraction function present; hardcoded regions work for ex1 but fail dynamically. set_bottom_green/red are simple but essential for bottom uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Ex1 correct: Likely matched special or zeros==9 with full fills, producing exact green regions and bottom green; top fill and middle logic aligned perfectly (no differences noted).
 * Ex2 incorrect: Generated fills rows 18-20/23-25 with green in positions like (18,6-10)=3 (but expected 8 there? Wait, expected has 3's in (18,6-10) actually—no, diff is in rows 18-20: generated has no 3's in col 6-10 for row 18-20, but expected has 3's there; also row 23-25 col 0-5/16-20 get partial green but expected full 3's in some blob shapes (e.g., expected (23,6-10)=3 but generated 8). Bottom green correct, but middle underfills "train" areas; top colors {1,2,6,9?} fallback to partial_second overfills row 12-16 selectively wrong.
 * Ex3 incorrect: Generated sets top rows 0-4 to all 3's (but expected all 8's—no fill); bottom to green (expected red); middle fills like rows 7-17 cols 6-10=3 (but expected partial or 8 in some); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; rows 23-26 cols 16-20 partial green but expected more structured (e.g., col 16-20 row 23=3 but with extensions). Overfills based on assuming special=false but colors={2,4}? Actually top has 2/4 blobs, so triggered train3 but filled wrong regions; bottom should be red since not special.
 * Ex4 incorrect: Generated fills rows 12-16 cols 0-21 with green blobs (e.g., row 12 all 3's but expected row 12 cols 6-20=3 partial); row 13-15 have 3's around existing 7/1/6/0 but expected more uniform 3's in cols 6-20; row 17 no fill (correct?); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; bottom red correct. Underfills lower middle (e.g., rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20=8 but expected some 3's); zeros in top==9? but triggered partial_second wrongly, ignoring blob shapes around 7/1/6.
 * Ex5 incorrect: Generated top rows 0-4 unchanged (correct, all 8's? No, top has 1/9 blobs, expected unchanged); but row 7 cols 6-10=3 (expected 8); row 17 cols 16-21=3 partial (expected 8); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=3 but expected 8/3 mixed; rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20 no fill but expected 3's in some; bottom red correct. Triggered train5 for {1,9} but overfills vertical middle instead of exact train5 regions; partial_second fallback wrong for scattered 1's.
 * Overall: Hardcoded regions help for static fills but miss dynamic blob extension (e.g., fill around existing colors like in ex2 expected row 18 col6-10=3 extending from top); special check works but top fill overapplies in non-special (ex3); colors set detection good but {2,4}/{1,9} triggers wrong for mixed tops; zeros==9 not handling full vs partial accurately (ex4 underfills). No function for blob detection—essential for extending fills to match shapes (e.g., connect 8's to existing colors). fill_top_with_green limited to top 5 but name/code confusing. program() copies grid correctly but sequential ifs cause fallback overfill (else: partial_second too broad).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Top rows 0-4 unchanged (has 0's and blobs of 1/9/2—correct, no full fill); but middle row 12-16 filled with full green block cols 0-21 (e.g., row 12 all 3's, but likely should be partial around existing 7/1/6/0/9); row 17 no fill (8's, possibly correct); rows 18-20 cols 0-5/11-15/21=8 but cols 6-10=8 (should extend to 3? based on ex patterns); rows 23-25 cols 0-5=8 but expected some green extension for 2-blob; bottom red (correct for non-special). Top colors ~{1,2,9}, zeros~9?, so should trigger partial_second or train mix, but generated overfills row 12-16 uniformly (ignores existing 0/7/1/6/9 shapes) and underfills lower (no train3/5 for {1,9}+2). Looks like fallback partial_second applied wrongly—missing blob-aware filling to match expected structured greens around colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle where a 30x22 grid containing numbers 0-9 (as clues or partial shapes) and 8's (blanks to be filled) must have the 8's replaced selectively with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on detecting the presence or patterns of certain numbers in predefined sub-regions (e.g., left, mid, right areas across rows). The goal is to "complete" visual elements like bars, frames, or object outlines by filling only when clues indicate a match, while leaving some 8's unfilled to preserve structure; entire rows or blocks (e.g., top/bottom) may fill with 3's or 2's conditionally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural rows: rows 0-4 and 28-29 often fill entirely with 3's (or 2's if top conditions fail), row 5 and 25-26 with 6's, row 6/7/11/12/16/17/21/22/27/28 with potential 8's or partial fills; vertical bars (e.g., col 0/21 often 8's) and horizontal dividers must not be over-filled.
 * Clues are sparse numbers in rows 1-3 (top), 8-10 (upper mid), 12-16 (lower mid), 18-20 (bottom left/mid), 23-25 (bottom right); detect "any" presence (e.g., one 0 or 1 in a column range) or "all non-8" patterns (e.g., all non-8's are 9's in a region) to trigger fills, but only fill 8's, not overwriting existing numbers.
 * Subtleties: Fills are region-specific (e.g., left: cols 1-6 or 2-5, mid: 6-11 or 7-11, right: 11-21 or 12-16/16-21); order matters (early fills like top can affect later checks); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill divider rows like 17/22 if conditions partial); "full_zero_left" requires all in range ==0, not "any"; "is_nine_right" checks non-8's are all 9's but allows 8's; bottom fills (e.g., rows 18-22) depend on combos like has_one_mid + any_two_far for tall verticals, but exclude if not full match; test cases show asymmetric patterns (e.g., 2's or 4's scattered, not uniform).
 * Easy to miss: Some regions overlap (e.g., right fills span 11-21, affecting far right); conditions like "not has_one_mid" prevent fills in alternatives; bottom rows 28-29 always 3's if top has both 0 and 1, else 2's; vertical consistency (e.g., if left has any_two, fill rows 7-12 cols 1-6); no fills in cols 0/21 or row edges if 8's there; puzzle preserves "shapes" like 7's in right or 0's in mid without overwriting.
 * All attempts consider row ranges like 7-27 for tall fills, but miss partial matches (e.g., if two_far but no one_mid, fill only subset); include checks for scattered clues (e.g., any_four_mid triggers bottom left fill); avoid filling if clue is isolated (e.g., single 2 doesn't always trigger).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown (same program for all) passed training example 2 (full logic worked for that case's clues, e.g., top 0+1 triggered full top/bottom 3's, and mid/right conditions aligned without overfill).
 * Failed training 1: Over-filled row 17 (cols 6-11 and possibly others) with 3's due to has_one_mid and any_two_far triggering tall fill range(7,27) mid, but expected keeps it 8's (likely because two_far is in bottom rows 18-22, not top rows 1-3 for the check; check ranges mismatch clue locations).
 * Failed training 3: Filled row 7 left with 3's (correct), but row 17 left/mid empty in generated vs expected filled row 17 empty but row 18 filled correctly; also bottom row 28-29 filled with 2's incorrectly (top lacked 0+1?); row 22 filled partially wrong (expected 3's in right but generated 8's); any_two_left triggered upper left but missed lower dependencies.
 * Failed training 4: Top filled correctly with 0's present, but row 17 mid filled with 3's incorrectly (expected 8's, similar to train 1 overfill); row 18 left filled but expected empty in some; bottom row 28-29 with 2's wrong (should be 3's); is_nine_right not triggered properly, leaving right partial.
 * Failed training 5: Top not filled (no 0/1 in top? generated keeps 8's row 0-4); row 8 right over-filled with 3's in col 16-20; row 17 empty correct but row 18 mid over-filled; has_one_mid triggered tall mid but expected partial (e.g., row 7 empty); bottom 28-29 with 2's wrong.
 * Conditions like any_two_far use top rows 1-3 but clues often in bottom (e.g., rows 18-22), causing false positives/negatives; full_zero_left too strict for partial 0's; no function to check bottom-specific clues (e.g., any_two in rows 18-20); fill_region helpful but ranges too broad (e.g., range(7,27) fills dividers); is_nine_right useful but range(12,16) misses far right; no extraction for full shapes (e.g., count 9's exactly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top/bottom filled with 3's correctly assuming 0+1 in top row 1-3; left/mid/right regions filled in rows 12-17 based on 7/1/0 clues; bottom rows 18-22 filled with 3's around 4/2/1/5 clues) but does not look fully correct: over-fills row 7-11 mid/right with 3's (e.g., col 6-11 in row 8 has 3's around 0's, but may encroach on upper structure; expected likely keeps some 8's for separation); row 23-27 right over-filled vertically (e.g., col 6-11 in 23-27 has 3's around 6's, but test has scattered 9's/6's/2's suggesting partial fill only); row 12 left filled but col 1-6 has 3's overwriting potential edges; differences from logic: any_two_far likely false (2's in bottom col 17-21, not checked there), yet tall mid fill happened, mismatching train 1 issue; bottom row 28-29 correct as 3's, but overall too many 3's in verticals (e.g., col 3 in rows 7-27 all 3's, likely breaks shape); does not account for no has_seven_right (9's instead), so right fill range(12,17) cols 11-21 wrong—expected partial 8's preserved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) with fixed structural elements (e.g., bands of 3s, 2s, or 6s in specific rows) and clue numbers (0,1,2,7,9) placed in certain positions, where the goal is to replace all 8s (unknown cells) with either 2 or 3 to form coherent regions or "blobs" based on positional rules and interactions between clues. The filling rules appear to propagate from clue conditions to fill rectangular regions, with 3 often indicating a "primary" or connected fill and 2 a "secondary" or default fill, while avoiding overfilling or conflicting with existing clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed bands: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are horizontal bands filled entirely with 3 or 2; row 5 and row 30 are always full 6s (perhaps dividers or walls); rows 6-7 and 25-27 often start as 8s but get partial fills.
 * Clues (0,1,2,7,9) are checked in specific subregions (e.g., "top" clues in rows 1-3, cols 0-21 for 0/1/2; "left" in cols 2-4; "mid" in cols 7-10; "right" in cols 12-15 or 16-20), and conditions like "has_zero_top" or "is_nine_right" (which requires all non-8s in a region to be 9 and at least one present) trigger fills only in 8s within target rectangles.
 * Subtleties include conditional dependencies: e.g., bottom band fills with 3 only if top clues have both 0 and 1; upper left fill extends to col 6 under specific 2 placements; long mid (rows 8-26, cols 6-10) requires both 1 in mid and 2 in far right; row 17 mid fill depends on negation (not full_zero_left); lower far has early/late variants based on 1-left vs. (2-far and not 1-mid).
 * Order of function calls in program() matters, as fills only target 8s and later fills can overwrite if regions overlap (though current code avoids this by sequential non-overlapping regions).
 * Easy-to-miss: Fills are rectangular but sometimes partial (e.g., upper left adds col 6 conditionally); "full_zero_left" requires all three cells in rows 1-3, cols 2-4 to be 0 (not any); no fills touch clue positions (preserves 0/1/2/7/9); bottom rows 28-29 default to 2 unless top condition met; some regions like middle right (rows 12-16, cols 11-20) fill broadly if 7 in right.
 * Across attempts, issues include overfilling (e.g., filling where clues block or conditions not fully met), underfilling (e.g., missing propagations to adjacent cols like 6 or 11), ignoring negations (e.g., not full_zero_left), and mishandling "is_nine_right" (fills even if mixed non-8s). Test cases highlight sensitivity to clue interactions across vertical bands (left/mid/right).
 * No rotation or symmetry assumed; all checks are absolute positions. 8s outside defined regions may remain unfilled, but expectations show all 8s filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current code uses simple any/all comprehensions for conditions, which are helpful for quick regional checks. No complex types or extractions needed yet, but potential for region-specific validators.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks entire top band for 0 (helpful for global top/bottom trigger)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Useful for strict "all clues are 9" without 8s interfering

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(r_start, r_end + 1):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Core filling tool; only targets 8s, preserves clues
```

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_upper_far` relies on `is_nine_right` which may misfire if region has 8s mixed with non-9s (it collects non-8s correctly but assumes presence implies fill—subtle bug in some cases). `fill_row17_mid` uses complex negation which failed in Train3/5. No object extraction functions present or needed; simple grid iteration suffices.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct—properly filled top/bottom bands with 3s (due to 0/1 top presence), upper/middle/lower regions with 3s based on 2-left, 1-mid, 7-right, etc.; no over/underfills observed.
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated extra 3s in row7 cols6-10 (should be 8s, as no long_mid trigger without 2-far?); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left requires full_zero_left, which isn't met); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (condition (has_one_mid and not full_zero_left) or any_two_mid not fully satisfied); row22 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (no upper_left propagation?); overall, overfilled mid/left regions without strict conditions.
 * Train3: Incorrect—underfilled row7 (expected 3s in cols1-5, but generated 8s—upper_left missed due to no 2-left? Wait, clues have 2s there); row11 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left overtriggered); row16 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle regions missed); row17 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s in cols6-10 only? No, expectations show row17 all 8s except mid 3s—generated missed mid; row18 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s initially then propagated; bottom rows 30-31 are 2s as expected but top clues lacked 0/1 pair? Major issue: left/mid fills inconsistent with negations and propagations.
 * Train4: Correct—handled complex interactions like 1-left triggering lower_far_early, 2-top for lower_mid, etc.; all regions filled precisely without extras.
 * Train5: Incorrect—row12 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_mid triggered wrongly without strict 1-mid?); row16 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle_left missed); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (row17_mid overtriggered); row21 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_left/mid missed due to no 2-left/top?); row22 all 8s but expected partial 3s in lower; overfilled some right regions with 3s where 8s expected (e.g., row8-11 cols16-20).
 * General: Conditions like full_zero_left and negations (not full_zero_left) often fail, leading to missed or extra mid fills; upper_far works when 9s present but not if mixed; long_mid undertriggers without 2-far; no function for extracting full clue regions (e.g., to validate blob shapes), which might help debug; fill order causes no overwrites but misses chained fills (e.g., upper to middle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—while top/bottom bands are properly 3s (due to 0-top and 1-top present), and some regions like upper left (rows8-11 cols1-5=3s), middle mid (rows12-16 cols6-10=3s), lower left/mid (rows18-21 cols1-5/6-10=3s) match expectations, there are mismatches: row7 cols1-5 are 8s but should be 3s (upper_left trigger from 2-left present, but code's any_two_left should catch it—possible col range issue in fill_upper_left); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but if not full_zero_left (clues show mixed 0s), expected 8s; row22 cols16-20 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_far_late should trigger from 2-far and not 1-mid? Clues have 2s far right); row24-26 cols16-20 partial 3s but code filled full, mismatching sparse 2-clue positions; overall, underfills vertical propagations (e.g., row22-26 left/mid should chain from upper) and overfills bottom mid without negation check; does not make complete sense as some 8s remain (e.g., row7, row22 partial), violating full-fill expectation, and ignores subtle extensions like col6 in upper left.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:

            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:44:17] Response:
**High level:** This is a logic-based grid-filling puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram, area division, or clue-driven fill puzzle) where the top rows (1-3) contain clues (numbers like 0,1,2,7,9) that dictate how to fill unknown cells (8's) in specific regions of the lower grid with consistent numbers (often 3's, but sometimes 2's or others), dividing the grid into structured areas like "A", "B", "C", "D" based on column ranges (e.g., left: 1-5, mid: 6-10, right: 11-20). The goal is to propagate clue conditions to fill entire regions accurately while preserving given numbers and boundaries (e.g., 6's in row 5, 8's in barriers).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Clues are in rows 1-3, columns 0-21; specific sub-ranges matter: left clues (cols 2-5 for zeros/ones/twos), mid (7-11 for ones), right (12-16 for sevens/nines), far-right (17-21 for twos); conditions like "full_zero_left" (all zeros in rows 1-3, cols 2-5) or "is_nine_right" (non-8's in rows 1-3, cols 12-16 are all 9's) trigger fills, but partial matches (e.g., any 2 in certain ranges) also apply.
 * Fills are mostly to 3 in targeted regions (e.g., upper left: rows 8-11, cols 1-6 if any_two_left), but some to 2 (e.g., bottom rows 28-29 if no zero and one in top); regions overlap or depend on negations (e.g., lower mid fill if any_two_top AND NOT (has_one_mid and any_two_far)), and fills only apply to 8's, preserving clues like 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,9.
 * Grid structure: Top/bottom borders (rows 0-4 and 28-29) fill with 3's or 2's based on top clues; middle sections (rows 6-27) divided into bands (upper: 7-11, middle B: 12-17, lower C: 17-21, D: 22-26) with column-specific fills (left/mid/right/far); row 6 and 29 are full 6's; barriers (unfilled 8's) in row 11 cols 0/21, etc.; subtle overlaps (e.g., row 17 in both B and C) require careful ordering.
 * Easy to miss: Fills don't always cover full regions (e.g., upper far C: rows 17-21 but only cols 16-20, with extras on 17/21); conditions can conflict (e.g., if has_one_mid and any_two_far blocks lower C mid); top clues can have mixed values (e.g., some 8's in clue areas mean partial detection); bottom fills depend on top having both 0 and 1; no fills in some areas (e.g., row 21 cols 0/21 stay 8 if not triggered).
 * All given numbers (non-8's) must remain unchanged; over-filling (e.g., changing a 7 to 3) or under-filling (leaving 8's) causes mismatches; puzzle enforces symmetry or patterns in filled regions (e.g., uniform 3's in blobs around clues).
 * Ordering matters: Top/bottom fills first, then upper/middle/lower in sequence to avoid overwriting; some trainings show expected fills in non-clue areas (e.g., row 7 cols 6-10 to 3 if condition), but generated often misses or overfills adjacent cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Inline detection functions from the program are helpful for condition checks, e.g.:
def detect_top_conditions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    has_zero_top = any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))

* These can be extracted/modularized for better debugging; no types defined, but could add a GridRegion class for row/col ranges to avoid hardcoding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating the program's condition triggers and fill regions are inaccurate or incomplete.
 * Train 1: Generated filled row 17 (lower B?) with 3's where expected has 8's (e.g., row 17 cols 1-21: generated all 3's except edges, expected 8's in cols 6-15); overfilled middle B right (row 13-16 cols 11-20 to 3's, but expected has mixed 6's/0's preserved correctly—wait, no, expected matches input clues but generated extra 3's in non-8 areas? Actually, main diff: row 17 fully 8's in expected, but generated 3's in left/mid/right; also row 21 cols 0-5/16-21 stay 8 in both, but lower C mid not filled correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled upper mid (row 7 cols 6-10 to 3's, expected 8's); lower C mid (rows 17-21 cols 6-10) to 3's where expected has 3's only in rows 19-21 cols 6-10 but 8's in 17-18; also D far (rows 22-26 cols 16-20) not filled (stays 8's, expected 3's in some? Wait, expected has 3's in rows 22-27? cols 6-10/16-20, but generated misses them); subtle: generated row 13 cols 1-5 as 8's, expected 3's.
 * Train 3: Generated top rows 0-4 as 8's (no fill), expected 8's—correct there; but upper left/mid (rows 8-11 cols 1-6/6-10) to 3's where expected has 3's only in rows 7-11 cols 1-5? Wait, expected row 7 cols 0-5 to 3's, generated row 7 all 8's except partial; big miss: bottom rows 28-29 to 2's? but generated 2's, expected 2's—partial match, but middle B left (rows 12-17 cols 1-5) to 8's in generated row 12, expected 8's; lower C (rows 17-21) overfilled to 3's in cols 1-5 where expected 3's only rows 17-21 cols 0-5? Unknown why row 7 fill missed.
 * Train 4: No top fill (rows 0-4 stay 8's, expected 8's—correct); middle B (rows 12-17) overfilled cols 11-20 to 3's where expected has 8's in cols 6-10/16-20 rows 12-17; lower C mid (rows 17-21 cols 6-10) to 3's, but expected 8's in row 17 cols 6-10; D not filled (8's, expected 8's?); subtle: row 18 cols 0-5 to 3's, expected 8's—overfill.
 * Train 5: Top rows 0-4 stay 8's, expected 8's—correct; upper far right (row 8-11 col 16-20) to 3's where expected 3's in row 7 cols 16-20 only? Generated row 7 all 8's, expected row 7 cols 16-20 to 3's; middle B right overfilled (rows 12-17 cols 11-20 to 3's? but code doesn't trigger has_seven_right fully); lower C left/mid to 3's in rows 17-21, expected 3's in rows 17-21 cols 0-5 and row 7 cols 16-20 but misses row 7; unknown why is_nine_right triggered extra 3's in row 8 col 16.
 * Overall: Program correctly detects some top/bottom fills (e.g., 3's in rows 0-4/28-29 when has_zero_top and has_one_top) and preserves clues, but fails on region boundaries (e.g., row 7/11/17/22 partial fills missed), negation conditions (e.g., not filling when has_one_mid and any_two_far), and overfills (e.g., filling non-8 areas or wrong cols); no function for region validation, leading to mismatches; inline detections are helpful but brittle (e.g., range(2,6) for any_two_left includes col 5, but clues may vary).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills top/bottom with 3's (rows 0-4/28-29), which may be correct if top clues have 0 and 1, but overfills mid clues (row 1-3 cols 7-10 to 3's/1's mixed, expected likely preserves more 1's/8's based on train patterns).
 * Upper sections (rows 7-11) show 3's in left/mid/far (e.g., row 7 cols 6-10/16-20 to 3's, row 11 cols 16-20 to 3's), but likely incorrect as trains show row 7 partial only (e.g., Train 2 expected row 7 cols 6-10 as 8's); right cols 12-15 have 9's preserved but surrounding 3's may overfill.
 * Middle B (rows 12-17) fills left/mid to 3's (cols 1-10), but right cols 11-20 stay 8's (no has_seven_right trigger?), expected likely 3's in cols 11-15 if 7 present; row 12 cols 0/21 stay 8—correct barrier.
 * Lower C (rows 17-22) overfills to 3's in cols 1-5/6-10/16-20, but trains suggest conditional (e.g., if any_two_top and not (one_mid and two_far), fill mid—but here filled unconditionally?); row 17 cols 6-15 stay 8 in generated? No, row 17 cols 1-5 to 3's, cols 6-15 8's—mismatch likely, as expected may fill mid if condition.
 * D (rows 22-26) not filled (all 8's), but trains (e.g., Train 2) expect 3's in cols 6-10/16-20 if !has_one_mid; test top has 1's in mid, so may block— but generated misses any D fill, possibly correct if condition not met, but looks incomplete as patterns suggest uniform fills.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: It has consistent 3's in some blobs but leaves too many 8's in expected fill areas (e.g., rows 12-17 cols 11-20, rows 22-27 cols 6-20), and overfills partial rows (e.g., row 1 cols 8-9 to 3's where clue likely 1/8); symmetries broken (e.g., row 9 cols 18-20 to 3's, but inconsistent with trains); no bottom 2's, assuming top has 0/1—needs clue check to confirm, but mismatches train expectations for similar clue setups.

[2025-10-02 10:44:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a grid (likely 31 rows by 22 columns, with numbers like 0,1,2,3 representing colors or states and 8 as blanks to fill), where patterns in the top panel (rows 1-4) trigger rules to fill blanks in middle and bottom sections with color 3 (or sometimes 2). The goal is to derive and apply conditional filling rules based on observed shapes and presences in the top, propagating to form connected or matching structures below.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top panel (rows 1-4, columns varying by section like 2-5 for left, 7-10 for middle left, 12-15 for middle right, 17-20 for right) contains diagnostic patterns (e.g., full "blue U" as three 1s in rows 1 and 3 cols 7-9 plus row 2 col 8; full 0 bar as all 0s in rows 1-3 cols 2-4) that act as triggers for filling entire shapes or connections in middle (rows 7-22) and bottom (rows 22-31).
 * Subtle elements include conditional negations (e.g., fill only if top has 1s but NOT full 0 bar), specific partial fills (e.g., around 7s in row 14 adjacent to blanks, or targeted positions like row 9 cols 6/10 for 0s shape), and connections (e.g., row 14 cols 11-20 as a bridge between sections).
 * Blanks (8s) are filled selectively only where they match the triggered shape, without overwriting existing numbers; bottom filling can be color 2 or 3 based on top U presence.
 * Grid boundaries must be respected—assuming fixed 31x22 size, but errors suggest possible variation or 0-indexing mismatches (e.g., rows 0-30, cols 0-21).
 * Rules are hierarchical/dependent (e.g., rule 9 requires full U and not 0 bar, overlapping with others like rule 5), so order matters to avoid over-filling; some rules (like 13) are placeholders for covered cases.
 * Easy to miss: presence checks (e.g., "has_top_left_2" scans for 2 in cols 2-4 rows 1-3) are loose (any occurrence triggers), not exact positions; bottom is uniformly filled across all 22 cols but only in rows 28-30; no filling in row 0 or top itself except rule 1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Helper for full blue U in top middle left (rows 1-3, specific cols 7-10)
def has_full_blue_u_top(out):
    return (out[1][7:10] == [1, 1, 1] and
            out[2][8] == 1 and
            out[3][7:10] == [1, 1, 1])
```
```python
# Helper for full 0 bar in top left (rows 1-3, cols 2-4)
def has_full_0_bar_top(out):
    return all(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))
```
```python
# Presence checker for top left 1s (any 1 in rows 1-3, any col)
def has_top_1s(out):
    for r in range(1, 4):
        if 1 in out[r]:
            return True
    return False
```
```python
# General filling utility (used in many rules: fill 8s in specified row ranges/cols with 3)
def fill_region(out, rows_range, cols_range):
    for r in rows_range:
        new_row = out[r][:]
        for c in cols_range:
            if new_row[c] == 8:
                new_row[c] = 3
        out[r] = new_row
# Note: This is a suggested refactor; original code inlines similar logic repeatedly.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt defines 13 detailed rules based on top patterns triggering middle/bottom fills, showing good understanding of puzzle structure (e.g., U shapes, bars, presences of digits like 1,2,4,6,9), but all executions fail with "list assignment index out of range" errors, likely due to assuming fixed grid size (e.g., accessing row 30 or col 21 on smaller inputs).
 * What worked: Rule logic captures many dependencies (e.g., conditional not full 0 bar, targeted positions like row 8 cols 16/18/20 for 9s shape), and helpers like has_full_blue_u_top accurately detect key triggers; bottom uniform fill in rows 28-30 cols 0-21 is correctly color-dependent.
 * What didn't work: Crashes prevent any output generation, so no fills occur; over-assumes grid dimensions (e.g., [bottom_color] * 22 sets full row but may exceed input width; accesses like out[3][7:10] fail if rows/cols shorter); no bounds checking or dynamic size detection.
 * Rule order may cause overlaps (e.g., rule 9 fills row 14 cols 11-20, potentially conflicting with rule 5's adjacent fills), but untestable due to errors.
 * No object extraction functions attempted (e.g., no helpers to identify shapes like U or bars beyond simple checks), which could help generalize but isn't essential if rules are hardcoded.
 * Helpers like has_top_middle_right_9 and has_top_left_2 are specific and useful for triggers but brittle (e.g., scan entire row slice for presence, which works if patterns are isolated).
 * The pass in rule 13 is a placeholder noting coverage by rule 9, which is fine but highlights redundancy.
 * Overall, problem understanding is partial: rules seem derived from training visuals, but implementation ignores potential input variations, leading to total failure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("list assignment index out of range"), so no grid is generated and it does not make sense or look correct—expected a filled grid with 8s replaced by 3s (or 2s) in pattern-matching regions, but crashes prevent evaluation.
 * Likely mismatch: code assumes at least 31 rows (accesses row 30) and 22 cols (e.g., out[r] = [bottom_color] * 22), but test input may have fewer (e.g., 20x20 or variable), causing index errors on assignment or slicing (e.g., out[1][7:10] if col <10).
 * Without output, can't confirm if fills would match expected (e.g., if test has top full U, should fill top rows 0-4 with 3s over 8s and bottom rows 28-30 fully with 3s), but errors mean it doesn't handle test case at all.
 * To fix for test: Add grid size checks (e.g., rows = len(g), cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0; clip ranges to min(rows,31), etc.) and avoid full-row assignments.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a logic-based grid-filling puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram, area division, or clue-driven fill puzzle) where the top rows (1-3) contain clues (numbers like 0,1,2,7,9) that dictate how to fill unknown cells (8's) in specific regions of the lower grid with consistent numbers (often 3's, but sometimes 2's or others), dividing the grid into structured areas like "A", "B", "C", "D" based on column ranges (e.g., left: 1-5, mid: 6-10, right: 11-20). The goal is to propagate clue conditions to fill entire regions accurately while preserving given numbers and boundaries (e.g., 6's in row 5, 8's in barriers).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Clues are in rows 1-3, columns 0-21; specific sub-ranges matter: left clues (cols 2-5 for zeros/ones/twos), mid (7-11 for ones), right (12-16 for sevens/nines), far-right (17-21 for twos); conditions like "full_zero_left" (all zeros in rows 1-3, cols 2-5) or "is_nine_right" (non-8's in rows 1-3, cols 12-16 are all 9's) trigger fills, but partial matches (e.g., any 2 in certain ranges) also apply.
 * Fills are mostly to 3 in targeted regions (e.g., upper left: rows 8-11, cols 1-6 if any_two_left), but some to 2 (e.g., bottom rows 28-29 if no zero and one in top); regions overlap or depend on negations (e.g., lower mid fill if any_two_top AND NOT (has_one_mid and any_two_far)), and fills only apply to 8's, preserving clues like 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,9.
 * Grid structure: Top/bottom borders (rows 0-4 and 28-29) fill with 3's or 2's based on top clues; middle sections (rows 6-27) divided into bands (upper: 7-11, middle B: 12-17, lower C: 17-21, D: 22-26) with column-specific fills (left/mid/right/far); row 6 and 29 are full 6's; barriers (unfilled 8's) in row 11 cols 0/21, etc.; subtle overlaps (e.g., row 17 in both B and C) require careful ordering.
 * Easy to miss: Fills don't always cover full regions (e.g., upper far C: rows 17-21 but only cols 16-20, with extras on 17/21); conditions can conflict (e.g., if has_one_mid and any_two_far blocks lower C mid); top clues can have mixed values (e.g., some 8's in clue areas mean partial detection); bottom fills depend on top having both 0 and 1; no fills in some areas (e.g., row 21 cols 0/21 stay 8 if not triggered).
 * All given numbers (non-8's) must remain unchanged; over-filling (e.g., changing a 7 to 3) or under-filling (leaving 8's) causes mismatches; puzzle enforces symmetry or patterns in filled regions (e.g., uniform 3's in blobs around clues).
 * Ordering matters: Top/bottom fills first, then upper/middle/lower in sequence to avoid overwriting; some trainings show expected fills in non-clue areas (e.g., row 7 cols 6-10 to 3 if condition), but generated often misses or overfills adjacent cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Inline detection functions from the program are helpful for condition checks, e.g.:
def detect_top_conditions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    has_zero_top = any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))
    has_one_top = any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))
    return has_zero_top, has_one_top

def detect_clue_conditions(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    full_zero_left = all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))
    has_one_mid = any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 11))
    has_seven_right = any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16))
    non_eight_right = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16) if g[r][c] != 8]
    is_nine_right = len(non_eight_right) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight_right)
    any_two_left = any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 6))
    any_two_far = any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(17, 22))
    any_two_top = any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))
    return {
        'full_zero_left': full_zero_left,
        'has_one_mid': has_one_mid,
        'has_seven_right': has_seven_right,
        'is_nine_right': is_nine_right,
        'any_two_left': any_two_left,
        'any_two_far': any_two_far,
        'any_two_top': any_two_top
    }
```
* These can be extracted/modularized for better debugging; no types defined, but could add a GridRegion class for row/col ranges to avoid hardcoding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating the program's condition triggers and fill regions are inaccurate or incomplete.
 * Train 1: Generated filled row 17 (lower B?) with 3's where expected has 8's (e.g., row 17 cols 1-21: generated all 3's except edges, expected 8's in cols 6-15); overfilled middle B right (row 13-16 cols 11-20 to 3's, but expected has mixed 6's/0's preserved correctly—wait, no, expected matches input clues but generated extra 3's in non-8 areas? Actually, main diff: row 17 fully 8's in expected, but generated 3's in left/mid/right; also row 21 cols 0-5/16-21 stay 8 in both, but lower C mid not filled correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled upper mid (row 7 cols 6-10 to 3's, expected 8's); lower C mid (rows 17-21 cols 6-10) to 3's where expected has 3's only in rows 19-21 cols 6-10 but 8's in 17-18; also D far (rows 22-26 cols 16-20) not filled (stays 8's, expected 3's in some? Wait, expected has 3's in rows 22-27? cols 6-10/16-20, but generated misses them); subtle: generated row 13 cols 1-5 as 8's, expected 3's.
 * Train 3: Generated top rows 0-4 as 8's (no fill), expected 8's—correct there; but upper left/mid (rows 8-11 cols 1-6/6-10) to 3's where expected has 3's only in rows 7-11 cols 1-5? Wait, expected row 7 cols 0-5 to 3's, generated row 7 all 8's except partial; big miss: bottom rows 28-29 to 2's? but generated 2's, expected 2's—partial match, but middle B left (rows 12-17 cols 1-5) to 8's in generated row 12, expected 8's; lower C (rows 17-21) overfilled to 3's in cols 1-5 where expected 3's only rows 17-21 cols 0-5? Unknown why row 7 fill missed.
 * Train 4: No top fill (rows 0-4 stay 8's, expected 8's—correct); middle B (rows 12-17) overfilled cols 11-20 to 3's where expected has 8's in cols 6-10/16-20 rows 12-17; lower C mid (rows 17-21 cols 6-10) to 3's, but expected 8's in row 17 cols 6-10; D not filled (8's, expected 8's?); subtle: row 18 cols 0-5 to 3's, expected 8's—overfill.
 * Train 5: Top rows 0-4 stay 8's, expected 8's—correct; upper far right (row 8-11 col 16-20) to 3's where expected 3's in row 7 cols 16-20 only? Generated row 7 all 8's, expected row 7 cols 16-20 to 3's; middle B right overfilled (rows 12-17 cols 11-20 to 3's? but code doesn't trigger has_seven_right fully); lower C left/mid to 3's in rows 17-21, expected 3's in rows 17-21 cols 0-5 and row 7 cols 16-20 but misses row 7; unknown why is_nine_right triggered extra 3's in row 8 col 16.
 * Overall: Program correctly detects some top/bottom fills (e.g., 3's in rows 0-4/28-29 when has_zero_top and has_one_top) and preserves clues, but fails on region boundaries (e.g., row 7/11/17/22 partial fills missed), negation conditions (e.g., not filling when has_one_mid and any_two_far), and overfills (e.g., filling non-8 areas or wrong cols); no function for region validation, leading to mismatches; inline detections are helpful but brittle (e.g., range(2,6) for any_two_left includes col 5, but clues may vary).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills top/bottom with 3's (rows 0-4/28-29), which may be correct if top clues have 0 and 1, but overfills mid clues (row 1-3 cols 7-10 to 3's/1's mixed, expected likely preserves more 1's/8's based on train patterns).
 * Upper sections (rows 7-11) show 3's in left/mid/far (e.g., row 7 cols 6-10/16-20 to 3's, row 11 cols 16-20 to 3's), but likely incorrect as trains show row 7 partial only (e.g., Train 2 expected row 7 cols 6-10 as 8's); right cols 12-15 have 9's preserved but surrounding 3's may overfill.
 * Middle B (rows 12-17) fills left/mid to 3's (cols 1-10), but right cols 11-20 stay 8's (no has_seven_right trigger?), expected likely 3's in cols 11-15 if 7 present; row 12 cols 0/21 stay 8—correct barrier.
 * Lower C (rows 17-22) overfills to 3's in cols 1-5/6-10/16-20, but trains suggest conditional (e.g., if any_two_top and not (one_mid and two_far), fill mid—but here filled unconditionally?); row 17 cols 6-15 stay 8 in generated? No, row 17 cols 1-5 to 3's, cols 6-15 8's—mismatch likely, as expected may fill mid if condition.
 * D (rows 22-26) not filled (all 8's), but trains (e.g., Train 2) expect 3's in cols 6-10/16-20 if !has_one_mid; test top has 1's in mid, so may block— but generated misses any D fill, possibly correct if condition not met, but looks incomplete as patterns suggest uniform fills.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: It has consistent 3's in some blobs but leaves too many 8's in expected fill areas (e.g., rows 12-17 cols 11-20, rows 22-27 cols 6-20), and overfills partial rows (e.g., row 1 cols 8-9 to 3's where clue likely 1/8); symmetries broken (e.g., row 9 cols 18-20 to 3's, but inconsistent with trains); no bottom 2's, assuming top has 0/1—needs clue check to confirm, but mismatches train expectations for similar clue setups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) where cells contain color codes (integers like 0 for empty, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc., up to 9) and 8 as a placeholder to be filled based on patterns or rules derived from the top section of the grid (roughly rows 0-4). The goal is to fill 8's in specific regions of the middle section (rows ~7-27) with 3 (green) according to structural or conditional rules (e.g., based on top colors, zero counts, or special configurations), while setting the bottom two rows (28-29) to either all 3 (green) or all 2 (red) depending on whether the top qualifies as "special." Fixed rows like 5 and 25 are all 6's (possibly a separator or background), and edges are often 8's that may or may not get filled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top section (rows 0-4) determines overall behavior: count of 8's in rows 0-4 (special if exactly 84), count of 0's in rows 1-3 (e.g., ==9 triggers specific fills), and set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3 (e.g., {2,4} or {1,9} triggers region-specific fills).
 * Bottom rows 28-29 are uniformly set to 3 if top is special (fill_top_with_green also applies), else to 2; this is consistent across examples but overrides other logic.
 * Middle fills target 8's only, preserving existing colors/0's; regions include vertical strips (e.g., cols 6-10 rows 7-17), partial rows (e.g., row 12 and 16 cols 1-20, with specific cols in 13-15), and "train"-like areas (e.g., left/bottom-right blobs filled conditionally).
 * Subtleties: Fills are not global—e.g., fill_full_second fills rows 12-17 cols 1-20 completely if conditions met, but fill_partial_second is more selective (top/bottom of that block + specific cols); vertical_middle is a narrow strip; train3_regions fills three disconnected areas (left upper, bottom-left middle, bottom-right lower); train5_regions fills two vertical-ish areas. Existing non-8 cells (e.g., 0's, colors) block or pattern-match fills.
 * Easy to miss: Top colors exclude 0/8 but include scattered non-8's that form patterns (e.g., blobs of 1's, 2's); zeros==9 suggests a specific sparse top pattern. Special check is row-limited (only top 5 rows, all cols). Edges (col 0/21) often remain 8 or get partial fills. Fixed rows (5,25 all 6's; sometimes top/bottom all 8's or 3's) must not be altered. Bottom green requires special=true, but red is default.
 * Across attempts: Program applies fills sequentially but conditionally (if special then green bottom + top fill, else red bottom); then nested ifs for middle based on zeros/special/colors, with else fallback to partial_second. This works for ex1 but overfills or underfills regions in others (e.g., filling where expected is 8 or different color). No rotation/flipping; assumes grid is oriented with patterns like "trains" or blobs in fixed positions.
 * Considerations: Patterns in top/middle suggest object detection (e.g., connected components of same color), but current code uses hardcoded regions—may miss dynamic shapes. 8's are fillers, but some expected outputs leave 8's unfilled (e.g., ex3 top is all 8's, not filled). Bottom red in ex3/4/5 but generated green in some. Test input has mixed top (0's and colors like 1,9,2), suggesting partial_second or train logic, but generated fills middle with green in wrong spots.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def is_special(grid):  # Checks for exactly 84 eights in top 5 rows (all cols)—useful for green bottom/top fill trigger.
    count = 0
    for r in range(5):
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                count += 1
    return count == 84
```

```python
def count_zeros_top(grid):  # Counts 0's in rows 1-3 (all cols)—==9 triggers full vs partial second-row fills.
    count = 0
    for r in range(1, 4):
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

```python
def get_top_colors(grid):  # Set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3—matches {2,4} for train3, {1,9} for train5.
    s = set()
    for r in range(1, 4):
        for c in range(22):
            col = grid[r][c]
            if col not in (0, 8):
                s.add(col)
    return s
```

```python
# Fill functions (all target only 8's, preserve others)—useful for region-specific green fills:
def fill_top_with_green(grid):  # Fills all 8's in entire grid? (but code shows rows 0-4? Wait, code is full grid—may overfill).
    for r in range(5):  # Actually only top 5 rows in code, despite name.
        for c in range(22):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                grid[r][c] = 3

def fill_full_second(grid):  # Full block rows 12-17 cols 1-20.
    for r in range(12, 17):
        for c in range(1, 21):
            if grid[r][c] == 8:
                grid[r][c] = 3

def fill_partial_second(grid):  # Selective: rows 12/16 cols 1-20; specific cols in 13/15/14.
    # ... (as in code)

def fill_vertical_middle(grid):  # Narrow vertical: rows 7-17 cols 6-10.
    # ... (as in code)

def fill_train3_regions(grid):  # Three areas: rows 7-11 cols 1-5; 17-21 cols 1-10; 23-26 cols 16-20.
    # ... (as in code)

def fill_train5_regions(grid):  # Two areas: rows 7-16 cols 6-10; 17-21 cols 16-20.
    # ... (as in code)
```
Note: No object extraction function present; hardcoded regions work for ex1 but fail dynamically. set_bottom_green/red are simple but essential for bottom uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Ex1 correct: Likely matched special or zeros==9 with full fills, producing exact green regions and bottom green; top fill and middle logic aligned perfectly (no differences noted).
 * Ex2 incorrect: Generated fills rows 18-20/23-25 with green in positions like (18,6-10)=3 (but expected 8 there? Wait, expected has 3's in (18,6-10) actually—no, diff is in rows 18-20: generated has no 3's in col 6-10 for row 18-20, but expected has 3's there; also row 23-25 col 0-5/16-20 get partial green but expected full 3's in some blob shapes (e.g., expected (23,6-10)=3 but generated 8). Bottom green correct, but middle underfills "train" areas; top colors {1,2,6,9?} fallback to partial_second overfills row 12-16 selectively wrong.
 * Ex3 incorrect: Generated sets top rows 0-4 to all 3's (but expected all 8's—no fill); bottom to green (expected red); middle fills like rows 7-17 cols 6-10=3 (but expected partial or 8 in some); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; rows 23-26 cols 16-20 partial green but expected more structured (e.g., col 16-20 row 23=3 but with extensions). Overfills based on assuming special=false but colors={2,4}? Actually top has 2/4 blobs, so triggered train3 but filled wrong regions; bottom should be red since not special.
 * Ex4 incorrect: Generated fills rows 12-16 cols 0-21 with green blobs (e.g., row 12 all 3's but expected row 12 cols 6-20=3 partial); row 13-15 have 3's around existing 7/1/6/0 but expected more uniform 3's in cols 6-20; row 17 no fill (correct?); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; bottom red correct. Underfills lower middle (e.g., rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20=8 but expected some 3's); zeros in top==9? but triggered partial_second wrongly, ignoring blob shapes around 7/1/6.
 * Ex5 incorrect: Generated top rows 0-4 unchanged (correct, all 8's? No, top has 1/9 blobs, expected unchanged); but row 7 cols 6-10=3 (expected 8); row 17 cols 16-21=3 partial (expected 8); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=3 but expected 8/3 mixed; rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20 no fill but expected 3's in some; bottom red correct. Triggered train5 for {1,9} but overfills vertical middle instead of exact train5 regions; partial_second fallback wrong for scattered 1's.
 * Overall: Hardcoded regions help for static fills but miss dynamic blob extension (e.g., fill around existing colors like in ex2 expected row 18 col6-10=3 extending from top); special check works but top fill overapplies in non-special (ex3); colors set detection good but {2,4}/{1,9} triggers wrong for mixed tops; zeros==9 not handling full vs partial accurately (ex4 underfills). No function for blob detection—essential for extending fills to match shapes (e.g., connect 8's to existing colors). fill_top_with_green limited to top 5 but name/code confusing. program() copies grid correctly but sequential ifs cause fallback overfill (else: partial_second too broad).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Top rows 0-4 unchanged (has 0's and blobs of 1/9/2—correct, no full fill); but middle row 12-16 filled with full green block cols 0-21 (e.g., row 12 all 3's, but likely should be partial around existing 7/1/6/0/9); row 17 no fill (8's, possibly correct); rows 18-20 cols 0-5/11-15/21=8 but cols 6-10=8 (should extend to 3? based on ex patterns); rows 23-25 cols 0-5=8 but expected some green extension for 2-blob; bottom red (correct for non-special). Top colors ~{1,2,9}, zeros~9?, so should trigger partial_second or train mix, but generated overfills row 12-16 uniformly (ignores existing 0/7/1/6/9 shapes) and underfills lower (no train3/5 for {1,9}+2). Looks like fallback partial_second applied wrongly—missing blob-aware filling to match expected structured greens around colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle where a 30x22 grid containing numbers 0-9 (as clues or partial shapes) and 8's (blanks to be filled) must have the 8's replaced selectively with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on detecting the presence or patterns of certain numbers in predefined sub-regions (e.g., left, mid, right areas across rows). The goal is to "complete" visual elements like bars, frames, or object outlines by filling only when clues indicate a match, while leaving some 8's unfilled to preserve structure; entire rows or blocks (e.g., top/bottom) may fill with 3's or 2's conditionally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural rows: rows 0-4 and 28-29 often fill entirely with 3's (or 2's if top conditions fail), row 5 and 25-26 with 6's, row 6/7/11/12/16/17/21/22/27/28 with potential 8's or partial fills; vertical bars (e.g., col 0/21 often 8's) and horizontal dividers must not be over-filled.
 * Clues are sparse numbers in rows 1-3 (top), 8-10 (upper mid), 12-16 (lower mid), 18-20 (bottom left/mid), 23-25 (bottom right); detect "any" presence (e.g., one 0 or 1 in a column range) or "all non-8" patterns (e.g., all non-8's are 9's in a region) to trigger fills, but only fill 8's, not overwriting existing numbers.
 * Subtleties: Fills are region-specific (e.g., left: cols 1-6 or 2-5, mid: 6-11 or 7-11, right: 11-21 or 12-16/16-21); order matters (early fills like top can affect later checks); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill divider rows like 17/22 if conditions partial); "full_zero_left" requires all in range ==0, not "any"; "is_nine_right" checks non-8's are all 9's but allows 8's; bottom fills (e.g., rows 18-22) depend on combos like has_one_mid + any_two_far for tall verticals, but exclude if not full match; test cases show asymmetric patterns (e.g., 2's or 4's scattered, not uniform).
 * Easy to miss: Some regions overlap (e.g., right fills span 11-21, affecting far right); conditions like "not has_one_mid" prevent fills in alternatives; bottom rows 28-29 always 3's if top has both 0 and 1, else 2's; vertical consistency (e.g., if left has any_two, fill rows 7-12 cols 1-6); no fills in cols 0/21 or row edges if 8's there; puzzle preserves "shapes" like 7's in right or 0's in mid without overwriting.
 * All attempts consider row ranges like 7-27 for tall fills, but miss partial matches (e.g., if two_far but no one_mid, fill only subset); include checks for scattered clues (e.g., any_four_mid triggers bottom left fill); avoid filling if clue is isolated (e.g., single 2 doesn't always trigger).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown (same program for all) passed training example 2 (full logic worked for that case's clues, e.g., top 0+1 triggered full top/bottom 3's, and mid/right conditions aligned without overfill).
 * Failed training 1: Over-filled row 17 (cols 6-11 and possibly others) with 3's due to has_one_mid and any_two_far triggering tall fill range(7,27) mid, but expected keeps it 8's (likely because two_far is in bottom rows 18-22, not top rows 1-3 for the check; check ranges mismatch clue locations).
 * Failed training 3: Filled row 7 left with 3's (correct), but row 17 left/mid empty in generated vs expected filled row 17 empty but row 18 filled correctly; also bottom row 28-29 filled with 2's incorrectly (top lacked 0+1?); row 22 filled partially wrong (expected 3's in right but generated 8's); any_two_left triggered upper left but missed lower dependencies.
 * Failed training 4: Top filled correctly with 0's present, but row 17 mid filled with 3's incorrectly (expected 8's, similar to train 1 overfill); row 18 left filled but expected empty in some; bottom row 28-29 with 2's wrong (should be 3's); is_nine_right not triggered properly, leaving right partial.
 * Failed training 5: Top not filled (no 0/1 in top? generated keeps 8's row 0-4); row 8 right over-filled with 3's in col 16-20; row 17 empty correct but row 18 mid over-filled; has_one_mid triggered tall mid but expected partial (e.g., row 7 empty); bottom 28-29 with 2's wrong.
 * Conditions like any_two_far use top rows 1-3 but clues often in bottom (e.g., rows 18-22), causing false positives/negatives; full_zero_left too strict for partial 0's; no function to check bottom-specific clues (e.g., any_two in rows 18-20); fill_region helpful but ranges too broad (e.g., range(7,27) fills dividers); is_nine_right useful but range(12,16) misses far right; no extraction for full shapes (e.g., count 9's exactly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top/bottom filled with 3's correctly assuming 0+1 in top row 1-3; left/mid/right regions filled in rows 12-17 based on 7/1/0 clues; bottom rows 18-22 filled with 3's around 4/2/1/5 clues) but does not look fully correct: over-fills row 7-11 mid/right with 3's (e.g., col 6-11 in row 8 has 3's around 0's, but may encroach on upper structure; expected likely keeps some 8's for separation); row 23-27 right over-filled vertically (e.g., col 6-11 in 23-27 has 3's around 6's, but test has scattered 9's/6's/2's suggesting partial fill only); row 12 left filled but col 1-6 has 3's overwriting potential edges; differences from logic: any_two_far likely false (2's in bottom col 17-21, not checked there), yet tall mid fill happened, mismatching train 1 issue; bottom row 28-29 correct as 3's, but overall too many 3's in verticals (e.g., col 3 in rows 7-27 all 3's, likely breaks shape); does not account for no has_seven_right (9's instead), so right fill range(12,17) cols 11-21 wrong—expected partial 8's preserved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) with fixed structural elements (e.g., bands of 3s, 2s, or 6s in specific rows) and clue numbers (0,1,2,7,9) placed in certain positions, where the goal is to replace all 8s (unknown cells) with either 2 or 3 to form coherent regions or "blobs" based on positional rules and interactions between clues. The filling rules appear to propagate from clue conditions to fill rectangular regions, with 3 often indicating a "primary" or connected fill and 2 a "secondary" or default fill, while avoiding overfilling or conflicting with existing clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed bands: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are horizontal bands filled entirely with 3 or 2; row 5 and row 30 are always full 6s (perhaps dividers or walls); rows 6-7 and 25-27 often start as 8s but get partial fills.
 * Clues (0,1,2,7,9) are checked in specific subregions (e.g., "top" clues in rows 1-3, cols 0-21 for 0/1/2; "left" in cols 2-4; "mid" in cols 7-10; "right" in cols 12-15 or 16-20), and conditions like "has_zero_top" or "is_nine_right" (which requires all non-8s in a region to be 9 and at least one present) trigger fills only in 8s within target rectangles.
 * Subtleties include conditional dependencies: e.g., bottom band fills with 3 only if top clues have both 0 and 1; upper left fill extends to col 6 under specific 2 placements; long mid (rows 8-26, cols 6-10) requires both 1 in mid and 2 in far right; row 17 mid fill depends on negation (not full_zero_left); lower far has early/late variants based on 1-left vs. (2-far and not 1-mid).
 * Order of function calls in program() matters, as fills only target 8s and later fills can overwrite if regions overlap (though current code avoids this by sequential non-overlapping regions).
 * Easy-to-miss: Fills are rectangular but sometimes partial (e.g., upper left adds col 6 conditionally); "full_zero_left" requires all three cells in rows 1-3, cols 2-4 to be 0 (not any); no fills touch clue positions (preserves 0/1/2/7/9); bottom rows 28-29 default to 2 unless top condition met; some regions like middle right (rows 12-16, cols 11-20) fill broadly if 7 in right.
 * Across attempts, issues include overfilling (e.g., filling where clues block or conditions not fully met), underfilling (e.g., missing propagations to adjacent cols like 6 or 11), ignoring negations (e.g., not full_zero_left), and mishandling "is_nine_right" (fills even if mixed non-8s). Test cases highlight sensitivity to clue interactions across vertical bands (left/mid/right).
 * No rotation or symmetry assumed; all checks are absolute positions. 8s outside defined regions may remain unfilled, but expectations show all 8s filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current code uses simple any/all comprehensions for conditions, which are helpful for quick regional checks. No complex types or extractions needed yet, but potential for region-specific validators.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks entire top band for 0 (helpful for global top/bottom trigger)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Useful for strict "all clues are 9" without 8s interfering

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(r_start, r_end + 1):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Core filling tool; only targets 8s, preserves clues
```

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_upper_far` relies on `is_nine_right` which may misfire if region has 8s mixed with non-9s (it collects non-8s correctly but assumes presence implies fill—subtle bug in some cases). `fill_row17_mid` uses complex negation which failed in Train3/5. No object extraction functions present or needed; simple grid iteration suffices.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct—properly filled top/bottom bands with 3s (due to 0/1 top presence), upper/middle/lower regions with 3s based on 2-left, 1-mid, 7-right, etc.; no over/underfills observed.
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated extra 3s in row7 cols6-10 (should be 8s, as no long_mid trigger without 2-far?); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left requires full_zero_left, which isn't met); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (condition (has_one_mid and not full_zero_left) or any_two_mid not fully satisfied); row22 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (no upper_left propagation?); overall, overfilled mid/left regions without strict conditions.
 * Train3: Incorrect—underfilled row7 (expected 3s in cols1-5, but generated 8s—upper_left missed due to no 2-left? Wait, clues have 2s there); row11 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left overtriggered); row16 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle regions missed); row17 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s in cols6-10 only? No, expectations show row17 all 8s except mid 3s—generated missed mid; row18 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s initially then propagated; bottom rows 30-31 are 2s as expected but top clues lacked 0/1 pair? Major issue: left/mid fills inconsistent with negations and propagations.
 * Train4: Correct—handled complex interactions like 1-left triggering lower_far_early, 2-top for lower_mid, etc.; all regions filled precisely without extras.
 * Train5: Incorrect—row12 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_mid triggered wrongly without strict 1-mid?); row16 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle_left missed); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (row17_mid overtriggered); row21 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_left/mid missed due to no 2-left/top?); row22 all 8s but expected partial 3s in lower; overfilled some right regions with 3s where 8s expected (e.g., row8-11 cols16-20).
 * General: Conditions like full_zero_left and negations (not full_zero_left) often fail, leading to missed or extra mid fills; upper_far works when 9s present but not if mixed; long_mid undertriggers without 2-far; no function for extracting full clue regions (e.g., to validate blob shapes), which might help debug; fill order causes no overwrites but misses chained fills (e.g., upper to middle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—while top/bottom bands are properly 3s (due to 0-top and 1-top present), and some regions like upper left (rows8-11 cols1-5=3s), middle mid (rows12-16 cols6-10=3s), lower left/mid (rows18-21 cols1-5/6-10=3s) match expectations, there are mismatches: row7 cols1-5 are 8s but should be 3s (upper_left trigger from 2-left present, but code's any_two_left should catch it—possible col range issue in fill_upper_left); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but if not full_zero_left (clues show mixed 0s), expected 8s; row22 cols16-20 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_far_late should trigger from 2-far and not 1-mid? Clues have 2s far right); row24-26 cols16-20 partial 3s but code filled full, mismatching sparse 2-clue positions; overall, underfills vertical propagations (e.g., row22-26 left/mid should chain from upper) and overfills bottom mid without negation check; does not make complete sense as some 8s remain (e.g., row7, row22 partial), violating full-fill expectation, and ignores subtle extensions like col6 in upper left.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 10:50:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (approximately 30 rows by 22 columns) where cells contain numbers 0-9 (representing colored or patterned elements) or 8 (unknown/blank to be filled, typically with 3 based on patterns). The goal is to deduce and fill regions of 8's with 3's by detecting specific partial patterns or "clues" (like shapes of 0s, 1s, 2s, etc.) in designated areas (left, mid, right, far-right) that trigger rule-based fillings for larger blocks or strips, following nonogram-like or region-completion logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed known elements (borders of 3's and 6's in rows 0-4, 5-6, 28-29; 2's in some bottom rows for certain examples) and variable clue patterns in inner rows (7-27), with 8's to fill only where rules apply—never overwrite non-8 cells.
 * Key regions: Left (cols 2-4, rows 1-3 for 0/2), mid (cols 7-10 for 1/U-shape, cols 7-11 for 2/4), right (cols 12-15 for 7/9/6), far-right (cols 17-20 for 2/6/0). Fillings are rectangular regions (e.g., full rows/cols strips or blocks like rows 13-17, cols 1-20).
 * Subtle elements: "Full U mid" requires exact U-shape (1's in row1 cols7-9, row2 col8, row3 cols7-9); "nine right" means mostly 9's with at least one non-8; partial vs. full zero left (any 0 vs. all 0's in the 3x3 block); order of filling matters as early fills can enable later conditions (e.g., top/bottom fill with 3's if zero left + one mid).
 * Conditions are conditional on current state (e.g., fill vertical mid only if partial zero + full U + six right + two far, but not if full zero); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill middle left if full U is present); some rules are mutually exclusive (e.g., bottom fill 3's only if zero+one, else 2's—but 2's seem rare and example-specific).
 * Easy to miss: No filling if no 8's in target region (fill_region skips non-8's); patterns must be "has" (any) or "full" (all) specifically; big block fill requires all four conditions simultaneously; lower mid fill differs for two vs. four mid (row17 vs. row18 start); test inputs may lack top/bottom clues, relying on inner patterns.
 * Across attempts: Fillings propagate horizontally/vertically but only in 8's; examples vary in top/bottom (3's vs. 8's/2's), affecting early conditions; subtle shape mismatches (e.g., incomplete U or partial 9's) block rules; bottom rows can be 2's or 3's based on clues, but program hardcodes 3's sometimes incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))

def full_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))

def has_one_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 11))

def has_full_u_mid(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    if not all(g[1][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)):
        return False
    if g[2][8] != 1:
        return False
    if not all(g[3][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)):
        return False
    return True

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], row_start: int, row_end: int, col_start: int, col_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(row_start, row_end + 1):
        for c in range(col_start, col_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val
```
These detection functions (has_*, full_*, is_*) are helpful for pattern matching in specific regions; fill_region is essential for targeted updates without overwriting known cells. No types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Over-filled middle right block (row12 cols11-20 with 3's, but expected 8's in cols0-10 and partial 3's starting col1); under-filled row17 (all 8's, expected partial 3's in cols1-5? Wait, expected has row17 as 8's but row18-20 filled—mismatch in lower left timing); bottom rows correctly 3's but top/mid propagation wrong due to early zero+one trigger filling too much.
 * Training 1 also filled row13-15 incorrectly (e.g., row13 col11=3 but expected col0=8, cols1-20=3? No, expected row13 has 3's from col1; subtle: program filled col0=8 remains, but expected starts col1—col0 may be border).
 * Training 2: Failed to fill upper/middle vertical strips (e.g., rows7-11 cols6-10=3's in generated but expected rows7-8 cols6-10=8's? No, expected has row7 cols6-10=3's; actually, generated has extra 3's in row7 col6=8 remains but expected 3; main issue: under-filled left/mid in rows12-17 (e.g., row12 cols1-5=8's generated, expected 3's); also filled bottom as 3's but some examples need 2's if no zero+one.
 * Training 2 mismatches in right far (e.g., row1 col17-19=2's correct, but row23-26 cols16-20 under-filled as 8's vs. expected 3's? Expected has row23 cols16-20=8's—no, looking: generated row23 cols16-20=8's, expected same 8's; issue is over-filling vertical mid early due to partial zero without checking full U absence.
 * Training 3: No top/bottom clues (starts with 8's row0, ends 2's), so no early fill_top/bottom; under-filled upper left/mid (rows8-11 cols1-10= partial 3's but expected more in rows7-8 cols1-5=3's); filled lower far-right incorrectly (row25 cols16-20=3's but expected partial; subtle: two far + not one mid should fill row23-26 cols16-20, but program did, yet expected has row22 cols16-20=3's extra—timing issue); middle right over-filled rows12-16 cols11-20=8's generated vs. expected partial 3's.
 * Training 3 also missed upper far-right fill (rows8-11 cols16-20=8's generated, expected 3's if nine right); function has_two_far is helpful but not triggered correctly without prior fills.
 * Training 4: Correct, likely because it had balanced clues (zero left partial, full U, etc.) that triggered exact sequence without over/under-filling.
 * Training 5: Similar to 1/3, under-filled middle left (row12 cols1-5=8's generated, expected 3's row7 col1-5=3's but row12=8's—no, expected row7=3's cols1-5, generated row7=8's; main: over-filled far-right vertical (rows8-11 cols16-20=3's but expected row7 cols16-20=3's extra); also filled lower mid incorrectly (row17 cols6-10=8's vs. expected 3's if two mid); is_nine_right triggered upper but missed lower right C (rows17-21 cols16-20 under-filled).
 * Overall: Program order is sequential but misses interdependencies (e.g., fill upper left before checking two left); has_full_u_mid is precise but fragile (misses if any 1 missing); fill_d_right_if_two_far_not_one_mid underused in cases with one mid present; unhelpful: has_two_mid/has_four_mid overlap but fill_lower_mid handles elif—good, but has_six_far/has_six_right redundant if not differentiated; no function for extracting full grid patterns (e.g., no global shape detector), which might help but current region checks are sufficient; fill_bottom_if_zero_and_one sometimes sets 2's correctly but in test/training1 it set 3's when partial clues suggest 2's? No, code has else:2 but in training1 it did 3's—bug in condition.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (correctly detects zero left full + one mid for top/bottom 3's; fills middle left/right based on full zero + seven right; lower left/mid/right via four/two mid + nine right; far-right via two far), but looks incorrect in subtle ways: row12 cols0-10=8's/3's mismatch (generated row12 cols1-5? Wait, row12=[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] no, looking: row12=[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—fills cols1-10=3's, but if similar to training1 expected, may need cols0=8 border untouched, but row13-15 cols1-5/11-15 filled correctly? Issue: row7-11 cols6-10=8's (no vertical mid fill, correct if not partial zero + full U + six right + two far, but test has no six right visible, has nine right and two far, so under-filled vertical mid as 8's—expected likely 3's if two far not one mid triggers partial).
 * Test output misses upper fills (rows8-11 cols1-5=8's? No, row8-10 cols2/4=2's known, but cols1/3/5=8's unfilled vs. expected 3's if two left detected—program has fill_upper_left_if_two_left, but test row8-10 cols2/4=2's, so has_two_left true, should fill rows8-11 cols1-5=3's, but generated row8=[8,8,2,8,2,8,...] unfilled—bug: fill_upper_left checks rows1-3? No, has_two_left is rows1-3 cols2-4, but test has zeros there, not twos in upper; wait, test upper is zeros row1-3 cols2-4=0's, so no two left, correct no upper left fill.
 * Test output over-fills mid row1-3 cols7-10 (generated has 1,3,1 in row1, but known 1's + filled? Wait, input not shown, but generated row1 cols7-10=1,3,1? No, [3,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,...]—fills col8=3 but expected likely keeps partial 1's unfilled if not full U; subtle: has_one_mid true but not full U, so fill_middle_mid_if_one_not_full_u should fill rows12-16 cols6-10=3's (generated does row13-15 cols6-10=1's known +3's? But row12 cols6-10=3's generated, expected may not if no full zero absence check).
 * Overall, test output does not fully look correct: far-right lower (rows23-26 cols17-20=2's known, but cols16=8 unfilled vs. expected 3's via fill_d_right_if_two_far_not_one_mid—test has one mid, so condition false, correct no fill, but if expected fills, rule wrong; bottom 3's but test has two far + one mid, may need 2's like training2/3; unknown input makes hard, but propagation seems partial (e.g., no big block fill, correct no full combo).

[2025-10-02 10:50:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a grid (likely 31 rows by 22 columns, with numbers like 0,1,2,3 representing colors or states and 8 as blanks to fill), where patterns in the top panel (rows 1-4) trigger rules to fill blanks in middle and bottom sections with color 3 (or sometimes 2). The goal is to derive and apply conditional filling rules based on observed shapes and presences in the top, propagating to form connected or matching structures below.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top panel (rows 1-4, columns varying by section like 2-5 for left, 7-10 for middle left, 12-15 for middle right, 17-20 for right) contains diagnostic patterns (e.g., full "blue U" as three 1s in rows 1 and 3 cols 7-9 plus row 2 col 8; full 0 bar as all 0s in rows 1-3 cols 2-4) that act as triggers for filling entire shapes or connections in middle (rows 7-22) and bottom (rows 22-31).
 * Subtle elements include conditional negations (e.g., fill only if top has 1s but NOT full 0 bar), specific partial fills (e.g., around 7s in row 14 adjacent to blanks, or targeted positions like row 9 cols 6/10 for 0s shape), and connections (e.g., row 14 cols 11-20 as a bridge between sections).
 * Blanks (8s) are filled selectively only where they match the triggered shape, without overwriting existing numbers; bottom filling can be color 2 or 3 based on top U presence.
 * Grid boundaries must be respected—assuming fixed 31x22 size, but errors suggest possible variation or 0-indexing mismatches (e.g., rows 0-30, cols 0-21).
 * Rules are hierarchical/dependent (e.g., rule 9 requires full U and not 0 bar, overlapping with others like rule 5), so order matters to avoid over-filling; some rules (like 13) are placeholders for covered cases.
 * Easy to miss: presence checks (e.g., "has_top_left_2" scans for 2 in cols 2-4 rows 1-3) are loose (any occurrence triggers), not exact positions; bottom is uniformly filled across all 22 cols but only in rows 28-30; no filling in row 0 or top itself except rule 1.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Helper for full blue U in top middle left (rows 1-3, specific cols 7-10)
def has_full_blue_u_top(out):
    return (out[1][7:10] == [1, 1, 1] and
            out[2][8] == 1 and
            out[3][7:10] == [1, 1, 1])
```
```python
# Helper for full 0 bar in top left (rows 1-3, cols 2-4)
def has_full_0_bar_top(out):
    return all(out[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))
```
```python
# Presence checker for top left 1s (any 1 in rows 1-3, any col)
def has_top_1s(out):
    for r in range(1, 4):
        if 1 in out[r]:
            return True
    return False
```
```python
# General filling utility (used in many rules: fill 8s in specified row ranges/cols with 3)
def fill_region(out, rows_range, cols_range):
    for r in rows_range:
        new_row = out[r][:]
        for c in cols_range:
            if new_row[c] == 8:
                new_row[c] = 3
        out[r] = new_row
# Note: This is a suggested refactor; original code inlines similar logic repeatedly.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt defines 13 detailed rules based on top patterns triggering middle/bottom fills, showing good understanding of puzzle structure (e.g., U shapes, bars, presences of digits like 1,2,4,6,9), but all executions fail with "list assignment index out of range" errors, likely due to assuming fixed grid size (e.g., accessing row 30 or col 21 on smaller inputs).
 * What worked: Rule logic captures many dependencies (e.g., conditional not full 0 bar, targeted positions like row 8 cols 16/18/20 for 9s shape), and helpers like has_full_blue_u_top accurately detect key triggers; bottom uniform fill in rows 28-30 cols 0-21 is correctly color-dependent.
 * What didn't work: Crashes prevent any output generation, so no fills occur; over-assumes grid dimensions (e.g., [bottom_color] * 22 sets full row but may exceed input width; accesses like out[3][7:10] fail if rows/cols shorter); no bounds checking or dynamic size detection.
 * Rule order may cause overlaps (e.g., rule 9 fills row 14 cols 11-20, potentially conflicting with rule 5's adjacent fills), but untestable due to errors.
 * No object extraction functions attempted (e.g., no helpers to identify shapes like U or bars beyond simple checks), which could help generalize but isn't essential if rules are hardcoded.
 * Helpers like has_top_middle_right_9 and has_top_left_2 are specific and useful for triggers but brittle (e.g., scan entire row slice for presence, which works if patterns are isolated).
 * The pass in rule 13 is a placeholder noting coverage by rule 9, which is fine but highlights redundancy.
 * Overall, problem understanding is partial: rules seem derived from training visuals, but implementation ignores potential input variations, leading to total failure.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is an execution error ("list assignment index out of range"), so no grid is generated and it does not make sense or look correct—expected a filled grid with 8s replaced by 3s (or 2s) in pattern-matching regions, but crashes prevent evaluation.
 * Likely mismatch: code assumes at least 31 rows (accesses row 30) and 22 cols (e.g., out[r] = [bottom_color] * 22), but test input may have fewer (e.g., 20x20 or variable), causing index errors on assignment or slicing (e.g., out[1][7:10] if col <10).
 * Without output, can't confirm if fills would match expected (e.g., if test has top full U, should fill top rows 0-4 with 3s over 8s and bottom rows 28-30 fully with 3s), but errors mean it doesn't handle test case at all.
 * To fix for test: Add grid size checks (e.g., rows = len(g), cols = len(g[0]) if g else 0; clip ranges to min(rows,31), etc.) and avoid full-row assignments.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a logic-based grid-filling puzzle (likely a variant of a nonogram, area division, or clue-driven fill puzzle) where the top rows (1-3) contain clues (numbers like 0,1,2,7,9) that dictate how to fill unknown cells (8's) in specific regions of the lower grid with consistent numbers (often 3's, but sometimes 2's or others), dividing the grid into structured areas like "A", "B", "C", "D" based on column ranges (e.g., left: 1-5, mid: 6-10, right: 11-20). The goal is to propagate clue conditions to fill entire regions accurately while preserving given numbers and boundaries (e.g., 6's in row 5, 8's in barriers).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Clues are in rows 1-3, columns 0-21; specific sub-ranges matter: left clues (cols 2-5 for zeros/ones/twos), mid (7-11 for ones), right (12-16 for sevens/nines), far-right (17-21 for twos); conditions like "full_zero_left" (all zeros in rows 1-3, cols 2-5) or "is_nine_right" (non-8's in rows 1-3, cols 12-16 are all 9's) trigger fills, but partial matches (e.g., any 2 in certain ranges) also apply.
 * Fills are mostly to 3 in targeted regions (e.g., upper left: rows 8-11, cols 1-6 if any_two_left), but some to 2 (e.g., bottom rows 28-29 if no zero and one in top); regions overlap or depend on negations (e.g., lower mid fill if any_two_top AND NOT (has_one_mid and any_two_far)), and fills only apply to 8's, preserving clues like 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,9.
 * Grid structure: Top/bottom borders (rows 0-4 and 28-29) fill with 3's or 2's based on top clues; middle sections (rows 6-27) divided into bands (upper: 7-11, middle B: 12-17, lower C: 17-21, D: 22-26) with column-specific fills (left/mid/right/far); row 6 and 29 are full 6's; barriers (unfilled 8's) in row 11 cols 0/21, etc.; subtle overlaps (e.g., row 17 in both B and C) require careful ordering.
 * Easy to miss: Fills don't always cover full regions (e.g., upper far C: rows 17-21 but only cols 16-20, with extras on 17/21); conditions can conflict (e.g., if has_one_mid and any_two_far blocks lower C mid); top clues can have mixed values (e.g., some 8's in clue areas mean partial detection); bottom fills depend on top having both 0 and 1; no fills in some areas (e.g., row 21 cols 0/21 stay 8 if not triggered).
 * All given numbers (non-8's) must remain unchanged; over-filling (e.g., changing a 7 to 3) or under-filling (leaving 8's) causes mismatches; puzzle enforces symmetry or patterns in filled regions (e.g., uniform 3's in blobs around clues).
 * Ordering matters: Top/bottom fills first, then upper/middle/lower in sequence to avoid overwriting; some trainings show expected fills in non-clue areas (e.g., row 7 cols 6-10 to 3 if condition), but generated often misses or overfills adjacent cells.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
# Inline detection functions from the program are helpful for condition checks, e.g.:
def detect_top_conditions(g: List[List[int]]) -> tuple:
    has_zero_top = any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))
    has_one_top = any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))
    return has_zero_top, has_one_top

def detect_clue_conditions(g: List[List[int]]) -> dict:
    full_zero_left = all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))
    has_one_mid = any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 11))
    has_seven_right = any(g[r][c] == 7 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16))
    non_eight_right = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16) if g[r][c] != 8]
    is_nine_right = len(non_eight_right) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight_right)
    any_two_left = any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 6))
    any_two_far = any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(17, 22))
    any_two_top = any(g[r][c] == 2 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))
    return {
        'full_zero_left': full_zero_left,
        'has_one_mid': has_one_mid,
        'has_seven_right': has_seven_right,
        'is_nine_right': is_nine_right,
        'any_two_left': any_two_left,
        'any_two_far': any_two_far,
        'any_two_top': any_two_top
    }
```
* These can be extracted/modularized for better debugging; no types defined, but could add a GridRegion class for row/col ranges to avoid hardcoding.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 5 training examples failed (INCORRECT), indicating the program's condition triggers and fill regions are inaccurate or incomplete.
 * Train 1: Generated filled row 17 (lower B?) with 3's where expected has 8's (e.g., row 17 cols 1-21: generated all 3's except edges, expected 8's in cols 6-15); overfilled middle B right (row 13-16 cols 11-20 to 3's, but expected has mixed 6's/0's preserved correctly—wait, no, expected matches input clues but generated extra 3's in non-8 areas? Actually, main diff: row 17 fully 8's in expected, but generated 3's in left/mid/right; also row 21 cols 0-5/16-21 stay 8 in both, but lower C mid not filled correctly.
 * Train 2: Generated overfilled upper mid (row 7 cols 6-10 to 3's, expected 8's); lower C mid (rows 17-21 cols 6-10) to 3's where expected has 3's only in rows 19-21 cols 6-10 but 8's in 17-18; also D far (rows 22-26 cols 16-20) not filled (stays 8's, expected 3's in some? Wait, expected has 3's in rows 22-27? cols 6-10/16-20, but generated misses them); subtle: generated row 13 cols 1-5 as 8's, expected 3's.
 * Train 3: Generated top rows 0-4 as 8's (no fill), expected 8's—correct there; but upper left/mid (rows 8-11 cols 1-6/6-10) to 3's where expected has 3's only in rows 7-11 cols 1-5? Wait, expected row 7 cols 0-5 to 3's, generated row 7 all 8's except partial; big miss: bottom rows 28-29 to 2's? but generated 2's, expected 2's—partial match, but middle B left (rows 12-17 cols 1-5) to 8's in generated row 12, expected 8's; lower C (rows 17-21) overfilled to 3's in cols 1-5 where expected 3's only rows 17-21 cols 0-5? Unknown why row 7 fill missed.
 * Train 4: No top fill (rows 0-4 stay 8's, expected 8's—correct); middle B (rows 12-17) overfilled cols 11-20 to 3's where expected has 8's in cols 6-10/16-20 rows 12-17; lower C mid (rows 17-21 cols 6-10) to 3's, but expected 8's in row 17 cols 6-10; D not filled (8's, expected 8's?); subtle: row 18 cols 0-5 to 3's, expected 8's—overfill.
 * Train 5: Top rows 0-4 stay 8's, expected 8's—correct; upper far right (row 8-11 col 16-20) to 3's where expected 3's in row 7 cols 16-20 only? Generated row 7 all 8's, expected row 7 cols 16-20 to 3's; middle B right overfilled (rows 12-17 cols 11-20 to 3's? but code doesn't trigger has_seven_right fully); lower C left/mid to 3's in rows 17-21, expected 3's in rows 17-21 cols 0-5 and row 7 cols 16-20 but misses row 7; unknown why is_nine_right triggered extra 3's in row 8 col 16.
 * Overall: Program correctly detects some top/bottom fills (e.g., 3's in rows 0-4/28-29 when has_zero_top and has_one_top) and preserves clues, but fails on region boundaries (e.g., row 7/11/17/22 partial fills missed), negation conditions (e.g., not filling when has_one_mid and any_two_far), and overfills (e.g., filling non-8 areas or wrong cols); no function for region validation, leading to mismatches; inline detections are helpful but brittle (e.g., range(2,6) for any_two_left includes col 5, but clues may vary).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially fills top/bottom with 3's (rows 0-4/28-29), which may be correct if top clues have 0 and 1, but overfills mid clues (row 1-3 cols 7-10 to 3's/1's mixed, expected likely preserves more 1's/8's based on train patterns).
 * Upper sections (rows 7-11) show 3's in left/mid/far (e.g., row 7 cols 6-10/16-20 to 3's, row 11 cols 16-20 to 3's), but likely incorrect as trains show row 7 partial only (e.g., Train 2 expected row 7 cols 6-10 as 8's); right cols 12-15 have 9's preserved but surrounding 3's may overfill.
 * Middle B (rows 12-17) fills left/mid to 3's (cols 1-10), but right cols 11-20 stay 8's (no has_seven_right trigger?), expected likely 3's in cols 11-15 if 7 present; row 12 cols 0/21 stay 8—correct barrier.
 * Lower C (rows 17-22) overfills to 3's in cols 1-5/6-10/16-20, but trains suggest conditional (e.g., if any_two_top and not (one_mid and two_far), fill mid—but here filled unconditionally?); row 17 cols 6-15 stay 8 in generated? No, row 17 cols 1-5 to 3's, cols 6-15 8's—mismatch likely, as expected may fill mid if condition.
 * D (rows 22-26) not filled (all 8's), but trains (e.g., Train 2) expect 3's in cols 6-10/16-20 if !has_one_mid; test top has 1's in mid, so may block— but generated misses any D fill, possibly correct if condition not met, but looks incomplete as patterns suggest uniform fills.
 * Overall, test output does not look fully correct: It has consistent 3's in some blobs but leaves too many 8's in expected fill areas (e.g., rows 12-17 cols 11-20, rows 22-27 cols 6-20), and overfills partial rows (e.g., row 1 cols 8-9 to 3's where clue likely 1/8); symmetries broken (e.g., row 9 cols 18-20 to 3's, but inconsistent with trains); no bottom 2's, assuming top has 0/1—needs clue check to confirm, but mismatches train expectations for similar clue setups.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving a 30x22 grid (rows 0-29, columns 0-21) where cells contain color codes (integers like 0 for empty, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc., up to 9) and 8 as a placeholder to be filled based on patterns or rules derived from the top section of the grid (roughly rows 0-4). The goal is to fill 8's in specific regions of the middle section (rows ~7-27) with 3 (green) according to structural or conditional rules (e.g., based on top colors, zero counts, or special configurations), while setting the bottom two rows (28-29) to either all 3 (green) or all 2 (red) depending on whether the top qualifies as "special." Fixed rows like 5 and 25 are all 6's (possibly a separator or background), and edges are often 8's that may or may not get filled.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The top section (rows 0-4) determines overall behavior: count of 8's in rows 0-4 (special if exactly 84), count of 0's in rows 1-3 (e.g., ==9 triggers specific fills), and set of non-0/8 colors in rows 1-3 (e.g., {2,4} or {1,9} triggers region-specific fills).
 * Bottom rows 28-29 are uniformly set to 3 if top is special (fill_top_with_green also applies), else to 2; this is consistent across examples but overrides other logic.
 * Middle fills target 8's only, preserving existing colors/0's; regions include vertical strips (e.g., cols 6-10 rows 7-17), partial rows (e.g., row 12 and 16 cols 1-20, with specific cols in 13-15), and "train"-like areas (e.g., left/bottom-right blobs filled conditionally).
 * Subtleties: Fills are not global—e.g., fill_full_second fills rows 12-17 cols 1-20 completely if conditions met, but fill_partial_second is more selective (top/bottom of that block + specific cols); vertical_middle is a narrow strip; train3_regions fills three disconnected areas (left upper, bottom-left middle, bottom-right lower); train5_regions fills two vertical-ish areas. Existing non-8 cells (e.g., 0's, colors) block or pattern-match fills.
 * Easy to miss: Top colors exclude 0/8 but include scattered non-8's that form patterns (e.g., blobs of 1's, 2's); zeros==9 suggests a specific sparse top pattern. Special check is row-limited (only top 5 rows, all cols). Edges (col 0/21) often remain 8 or get partial fills. Fixed rows (5,25 all 6's; sometimes top/bottom all 8's or 3's) must not be altered. Bottom green requires special=true, but red is default.
 * Across attempts: Program applies fills sequentially but conditionally (if special then green bottom + top fill, else red bottom); then nested ifs for middle based on zeros/special/colors, with else fallback to partial_second. This works for ex1 but overfills or underfills regions in others (e.g., filling where expected is 8 or different color). No rotation/flipping; assumes grid is oriented with patterns like "trains" or blobs in fixed positions.
 * Considerations: Patterns in top/middle suggest object detection (e.g., connected components of same color), but current code uses hardcoded regions—may miss dynamic shapes. 8's are fillers, but some expected outputs leave 8's unfilled (e.g., ex3 top is all 8's, not filled). Bottom red in ex3/4/5 but generated green in some. Test input has mixed top (0's and colors like 1,9,2), suggesting partial_second or train logic, but generated fills middle with green in wrong spots.

    for r in range(5):  # Actually only top 5 rows in code, despite name.
        for c in range(22):

    # ... (as in code)
```
Note: No object extraction function present; hardcoded regions work for ex1 but fail dynamically. set_bottom_green/red are simple but essential for bottom uniformity.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Ex1 correct: Likely matched special or zeros==9 with full fills, producing exact green regions and bottom green; top fill and middle logic aligned perfectly (no differences noted).
 * Ex2 incorrect: Generated fills rows 18-20/23-25 with green in positions like (18,6-10)=3 (but expected 8 there? Wait, expected has 3's in (18,6-10) actually—no, diff is in rows 18-20: generated has no 3's in col 6-10 for row 18-20, but expected has 3's there; also row 23-25 col 0-5/16-20 get partial green but expected full 3's in some blob shapes (e.g., expected (23,6-10)=3 but generated 8). Bottom green correct, but middle underfills "train" areas; top colors {1,2,6,9?} fallback to partial_second overfills row 12-16 selectively wrong.
 * Ex3 incorrect: Generated sets top rows 0-4 to all 3's (but expected all 8's—no fill); bottom to green (expected red); middle fills like rows 7-17 cols 6-10=3 (but expected partial or 8 in some); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; rows 23-26 cols 16-20 partial green but expected more structured (e.g., col 16-20 row 23=3 but with extensions). Overfills based on assuming special=false but colors={2,4}? Actually top has 2/4 blobs, so triggered train3 but filled wrong regions; bottom should be red since not special.
 * Ex4 incorrect: Generated fills rows 12-16 cols 0-21 with green blobs (e.g., row 12 all 3's but expected row 12 cols 6-20=3 partial); row 13-15 have 3's around existing 7/1/6/0 but expected more uniform 3's in cols 6-20; row 17 no fill (correct?); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=8 but expected 3's; bottom red correct. Underfills lower middle (e.g., rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20=8 but expected some 3's); zeros in top==9? but triggered partial_second wrongly, ignoring blob shapes around 7/1/6.
 * Ex5 incorrect: Generated top rows 0-4 unchanged (correct, all 8's? No, top has 1/9 blobs, expected unchanged); but row 7 cols 6-10=3 (expected 8); row 17 cols 16-21=3 partial (expected 8); rows 18-20 cols 6-10=3 but expected 8/3 mixed; rows 23-25 cols 0-5/16-20 no fill but expected 3's in some; bottom red correct. Triggered train5 for {1,9} but overfills vertical middle instead of exact train5 regions; partial_second fallback wrong for scattered 1's.
 * Overall: Hardcoded regions help for static fills but miss dynamic blob extension (e.g., fill around existing colors like in ex2 expected row 18 col6-10=3 extending from top); special check works but top fill overapplies in non-special (ex3); colors set detection good but {2,4}/{1,9} triggers wrong for mixed tops; zeros==9 not handling full vs partial accurately (ex4 underfills). No function for blob detection—essential for extending fills to match shapes (e.g., connect 8's to existing colors). fill_top_with_green limited to top 5 but name/code confusing. program() copies grid correctly but sequential ifs cause fallback overfill (else: partial_second too broad).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: Top rows 0-4 unchanged (has 0's and blobs of 1/9/2—correct, no full fill); but middle row 12-16 filled with full green block cols 0-21 (e.g., row 12 all 3's, but likely should be partial around existing 7/1/6/0/9); row 17 no fill (8's, possibly correct); rows 18-20 cols 0-5/11-15/21=8 but cols 6-10=8 (should extend to 3? based on ex patterns); rows 23-25 cols 0-5=8 but expected some green extension for 2-blob; bottom red (correct for non-special). Top colors ~{1,2,9}, zeros~9?, so should trigger partial_second or train mix, but generated overfills row 12-16 uniformly (ignores existing 0/7/1/6/9 shapes) and underfills lower (no train3/5 for {1,9}+2). Looks like fallback partial_second applied wrongly—missing blob-aware filling to match expected structured greens around colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a logic-based grid-filling puzzle where a 30x22 grid containing numbers 0-9 (as clues or partial shapes) and 8's (blanks to be filled) must have the 8's replaced selectively with 3's in specific rectangular regions, based on detecting the presence or patterns of certain numbers in predefined sub-regions (e.g., left, mid, right areas across rows). The goal is to "complete" visual elements like bars, frames, or object outlines by filling only when clues indicate a match, while leaving some 8's unfilled to preserve structure; entire rows or blocks (e.g., top/bottom) may fill with 3's or 2's conditionally.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed structural rows: rows 0-4 and 28-29 often fill entirely with 3's (or 2's if top conditions fail), row 5 and 25-26 with 6's, row 6/7/11/12/16/17/21/22/27/28 with potential 8's or partial fills; vertical bars (e.g., col 0/21 often 8's) and horizontal dividers must not be over-filled.
 * Clues are sparse numbers in rows 1-3 (top), 8-10 (upper mid), 12-16 (lower mid), 18-20 (bottom left/mid), 23-25 (bottom right); detect "any" presence (e.g., one 0 or 1 in a column range) or "all non-8" patterns (e.g., all non-8's are 9's in a region) to trigger fills, but only fill 8's, not overwriting existing numbers.
 * Subtleties: Fills are region-specific (e.g., left: cols 1-6 or 2-5, mid: 6-11 or 7-11, right: 11-21 or 12-16/16-21); order matters (early fills like top can affect later checks); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill divider rows like 17/22 if conditions partial); "full_zero_left" requires all in range ==0, not "any"; "is_nine_right" checks non-8's are all 9's but allows 8's; bottom fills (e.g., rows 18-22) depend on combos like has_one_mid + any_two_far for tall verticals, but exclude if not full match; test cases show asymmetric patterns (e.g., 2's or 4's scattered, not uniform).
 * Easy to miss: Some regions overlap (e.g., right fills span 11-21, affecting far right); conditions like "not has_one_mid" prevent fills in alternatives; bottom rows 28-29 always 3's if top has both 0 and 1, else 2's; vertical consistency (e.g., if left has any_two, fill rows 7-12 cols 1-6); no fills in cols 0/21 or row edges if 8's there; puzzle preserves "shapes" like 7's in right or 0's in mid without overwriting.
 * All attempts consider row ranges like 7-27 for tall fills, but miss partial matches (e.g., if two_far but no one_mid, fill only subset); include checks for scattered clues (e.g., any_four_mid triggers bottom left fill); avoid filling if clue is isolated (e.g., single 2 doesn't always trigger).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt shown (same program for all) passed training example 2 (full logic worked for that case's clues, e.g., top 0+1 triggered full top/bottom 3's, and mid/right conditions aligned without overfill).
 * Failed training 1: Over-filled row 17 (cols 6-11 and possibly others) with 3's due to has_one_mid and any_two_far triggering tall fill range(7,27) mid, but expected keeps it 8's (likely because two_far is in bottom rows 18-22, not top rows 1-3 for the check; check ranges mismatch clue locations).
 * Failed training 3: Filled row 7 left with 3's (correct), but row 17 left/mid empty in generated vs expected filled row 17 empty but row 18 filled correctly; also bottom row 28-29 filled with 2's incorrectly (top lacked 0+1?); row 22 filled partially wrong (expected 3's in right but generated 8's); any_two_left triggered upper left but missed lower dependencies.
 * Failed training 4: Top filled correctly with 0's present, but row 17 mid filled with 3's incorrectly (expected 8's, similar to train 1 overfill); row 18 left filled but expected empty in some; bottom row 28-29 with 2's wrong (should be 3's); is_nine_right not triggered properly, leaving right partial.
 * Failed training 5: Top not filled (no 0/1 in top? generated keeps 8's row 0-4); row 8 right over-filled with 3's in col 16-20; row 17 empty correct but row 18 mid over-filled; has_one_mid triggered tall mid but expected partial (e.g., row 7 empty); bottom 28-29 with 2's wrong.
 * Conditions like any_two_far use top rows 1-3 but clues often in bottom (e.g., rows 18-22), causing false positives/negatives; full_zero_left too strict for partial 0's; no function to check bottom-specific clues (e.g., any_two in rows 18-20); fill_region helpful but ranges too broad (e.g., range(7,27) fills dividers); is_nine_right useful but range(12,16) misses far right; no extraction for full shapes (e.g., count 9's exactly).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense (top/bottom filled with 3's correctly assuming 0+1 in top row 1-3; left/mid/right regions filled in rows 12-17 based on 7/1/0 clues; bottom rows 18-22 filled with 3's around 4/2/1/5 clues) but does not look fully correct: over-fills row 7-11 mid/right with 3's (e.g., col 6-11 in row 8 has 3's around 0's, but may encroach on upper structure; expected likely keeps some 8's for separation); row 23-27 right over-filled vertically (e.g., col 6-11 in 23-27 has 3's around 6's, but test has scattered 9's/6's/2's suggesting partial fill only); row 12 left filled but col 1-6 has 3's overwriting potential edges; differences from logic: any_two_far likely false (2's in bottom col 17-21, not checked there), yet tall mid fill happened, mismatching train 1 issue; bottom row 28-29 correct as 3's, but overall too many 3's in verticals (e.g., col 3 in rows 7-27 all 3's, likely breaks shape); does not account for no has_seven_right (9's instead), so right fill range(12,17) cols 11-21 wrong—expected partial 8's preserved.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual logic puzzle involving a large grid (approximately 30 rows by 22 columns) where cells contain numbers 0-9 (representing colored or patterned elements) or 8 (unknown/blank to be filled, typically with 3 based on patterns). The goal is to deduce and fill regions of 8's with 3's by detecting specific partial patterns or "clues" (like shapes of 0s, 1s, 2s, etc.) in designated areas (left, mid, right, far-right) that trigger rule-based fillings for larger blocks or strips, following nonogram-like or region-completion logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed known elements (borders of 3's and 6's in rows 0-4, 5-6, 28-29; 2's in some bottom rows for certain examples) and variable clue patterns in inner rows (7-27), with 8's to fill only where rules apply—never overwrite non-8 cells.
 * Key regions: Left (cols 2-4, rows 1-3 for 0/2), mid (cols 7-10 for 1/U-shape, cols 7-11 for 2/4), right (cols 12-15 for 7/9/6), far-right (cols 17-20 for 2/6/0). Fillings are rectangular regions (e.g., full rows/cols strips or blocks like rows 13-17, cols 1-20).
 * Subtle elements: "Full U mid" requires exact U-shape (1's in row1 cols7-9, row2 col8, row3 cols7-9); "nine right" means mostly 9's with at least one non-8; partial vs. full zero left (any 0 vs. all 0's in the 3x3 block); order of filling matters as early fills can enable later conditions (e.g., top/bottom fill with 3's if zero left + one mid).
 * Conditions are conditional on current state (e.g., fill vertical mid only if partial zero + full U + six right + two far, but not if full zero); avoid over-filling (e.g., don't fill middle left if full U is present); some rules are mutually exclusive (e.g., bottom fill 3's only if zero+one, else 2's—but 2's seem rare and example-specific).
 * Easy to miss: No filling if no 8's in target region (fill_region skips non-8's); patterns must be "has" (any) or "full" (all) specifically; big block fill requires all four conditions simultaneously; lower mid fill differs for two vs. four mid (row17 vs. row18 start); test inputs may lack top/bottom clues, relying on inner patterns.
 * Across attempts: Fillings propagate horizontally/vertically but only in 8's; examples vary in top/bottom (3's vs. 8's/2's), affecting early conditions; subtle shape mismatches (e.g., incomplete U or partial 9's) block rules; bottom rows can be 2's or 3's based on clues, but program hardcodes 3's sometimes incorrectly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))

        return False
    if not all(g[3][c] == 1 for c in range(7, 10)):
        return False
    return True

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 16) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], row_start: int, row_end: int, col_start: int, col_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(row_start, row_end + 1):
        for c in range(col_start, col_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val
```
These detection functions (has_*, full_*, is_*) are helpful for pattern matching in specific regions; fill_region is essential for targeted updates without overwriting known cells. No types like classes are used, but List[List[int]] for grid is standard.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Training 1: Over-filled middle right block (row12 cols11-20 with 3's, but expected 8's in cols0-10 and partial 3's starting col1); under-filled row17 (all 8's, expected partial 3's in cols1-5? Wait, expected has row17 as 8's but row18-20 filled—mismatch in lower left timing); bottom rows correctly 3's but top/mid propagation wrong due to early zero+one trigger filling too much.
 * Training 1 also filled row13-15 incorrectly (e.g., row13 col11=3 but expected col0=8, cols1-20=3? No, expected row13 has 3's from col1; subtle: program filled col0=8 remains, but expected starts col1—col0 may be border).
 * Training 2: Failed to fill upper/middle vertical strips (e.g., rows7-11 cols6-10=3's in generated but expected rows7-8 cols6-10=8's? No, expected has row7 cols6-10=3's; actually, generated has extra 3's in row7 col6=8 remains but expected 3; main issue: under-filled left/mid in rows12-17 (e.g., row12 cols1-5=8's generated, expected 3's); also filled bottom as 3's but some examples need 2's if no zero+one.
 * Training 2 mismatches in right far (e.g., row1 col17-19=2's correct, but row23-26 cols16-20 under-filled as 8's vs. expected 3's? Expected has row23 cols16-20=8's—no, looking: generated row23 cols16-20=8's, expected same 8's; issue is over-filling vertical mid early due to partial zero without checking full U absence.
 * Training 3: No top/bottom clues (starts with 8's row0, ends 2's), so no early fill_top/bottom; under-filled upper left/mid (rows8-11 cols1-10= partial 3's but expected more in rows7-8 cols1-5=3's); filled lower far-right incorrectly (row25 cols16-20=3's but expected partial; subtle: two far + not one mid should fill row23-26 cols16-20, but program did, yet expected has row22 cols16-20=3's extra—timing issue); middle right over-filled rows12-16 cols11-20=8's generated vs. expected partial 3's.
 * Training 3 also missed upper far-right fill (rows8-11 cols16-20=8's generated, expected 3's if nine right); function has_two_far is helpful but not triggered correctly without prior fills.
 * Training 4: Correct, likely because it had balanced clues (zero left partial, full U, etc.) that triggered exact sequence without over/under-filling.
 * Training 5: Similar to 1/3, under-filled middle left (row12 cols1-5=8's generated, expected 3's row7 col1-5=3's but row12=8's—no, expected row7=3's cols1-5, generated row7=8's; main: over-filled far-right vertical (rows8-11 cols16-20=3's but expected row7 cols16-20=3's extra); also filled lower mid incorrectly (row17 cols6-10=8's vs. expected 3's if two mid); is_nine_right triggered upper but missed lower right C (rows17-21 cols16-20 under-filled).
 * Overall: Program order is sequential but misses interdependencies (e.g., fill upper left before checking two left); has_full_u_mid is precise but fragile (misses if any 1 missing); fill_d_right_if_two_far_not_one_mid underused in cases with one mid present; unhelpful: has_two_mid/has_four_mid overlap but fill_lower_mid handles elif—good, but has_six_far/has_six_right redundant if not differentiated; no function for extracting full grid patterns (e.g., no global shape detector), which might help but current region checks are sufficient; fill_bottom_if_zero_and_one sometimes sets 2's correctly but in test/training1 it set 3's when partial clues suggest 2's? No, code has else:2 but in training1 it did 3's—bug in condition.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense (correctly detects zero left full + one mid for top/bottom 3's; fills middle left/right based on full zero + seven right; lower left/mid/right via four/two mid + nine right; far-right via two far), but looks incorrect in subtle ways: row12 cols0-10=8's/3's mismatch (generated row12 cols1-5? Wait, row12=[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,...] no, looking: row12=[8,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]—fills cols1-10=3's, but if similar to training1 expected, may need cols0=8 border untouched, but row13-15 cols1-5/11-15 filled correctly? Issue: row7-11 cols6-10=8's (no vertical mid fill, correct if not partial zero + full U + six right + two far, but test has no six right visible, has nine right and two far, so under-filled vertical mid as 8's—expected likely 3's if two far not one mid triggers partial).
 * Test output misses upper fills (rows8-11 cols1-5=8's? No, row8-10 cols2/4=2's known, but cols1/3/5=8's unfilled vs. expected 3's if two left detected—program has fill_upper_left_if_two_left, but test row8-10 cols2/4=2's, so has_two_left true, should fill rows8-11 cols1-5=3's, but generated row8=[8,8,2,8,2,8,...] unfilled—bug: fill_upper_left checks rows1-3? No, has_two_left is rows1-3 cols2-4, but test has zeros there, not twos in upper; wait, test upper is zeros row1-3 cols2-4=0's, so no two left, correct no upper left fill.
 * Test output over-fills mid row1-3 cols7-10 (generated has 1,3,1 in row1, but known 1's + filled? Wait, input not shown, but generated row1 cols7-10=1,3,1? No, [3,3,0,0,0,3,3,1,3,1,3,3,...]—fills col8=3 but expected likely keeps partial 1's unfilled if not full U; subtle: has_one_mid true but not full U, so fill_middle_mid_if_one_not_full_u should fill rows12-16 cols6-10=3's (generated does row13-15 cols6-10=1's known +3's? But row12 cols6-10=3's generated, expected may not if no full zero absence check).
 * Overall, test output does not fully look correct: far-right lower (rows23-26 cols17-20=2's known, but cols16=8 unfilled vs. expected 3's via fill_d_right_if_two_far_not_one_mid—test has one mid, so condition false, correct no fill, but if expected fills, rule wrong; bottom 3's but test has two far + one mid, may need 2's like training2/3; unknown input makes hard, but propagation seems partial (e.g., no big block fill, correct no full combo).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a large grid (30 rows by 22 columns) with fixed structural elements (e.g., bands of 3s, 2s, or 6s in specific rows) and clue numbers (0,1,2,7,9) placed in certain positions, where the goal is to replace all 8s (unknown cells) with either 2 or 3 to form coherent regions or "blobs" based on positional rules and interactions between clues. The filling rules appear to propagate from clue conditions to fill rectangular regions, with 3 often indicating a "primary" or connected fill and 2 a "secondary" or default fill, while avoiding overfilling or conflicting with existing clues.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed bands: rows 0-4 and 28-29 are horizontal bands filled entirely with 3 or 2; row 5 and row 30 are always full 6s (perhaps dividers or walls); rows 6-7 and 25-27 often start as 8s but get partial fills.
 * Clues (0,1,2,7,9) are checked in specific subregions (e.g., "top" clues in rows 1-3, cols 0-21 for 0/1/2; "left" in cols 2-4; "mid" in cols 7-10; "right" in cols 12-15 or 16-20), and conditions like "has_zero_top" or "is_nine_right" (which requires all non-8s in a region to be 9 and at least one present) trigger fills only in 8s within target rectangles.
 * Subtleties include conditional dependencies: e.g., bottom band fills with 3 only if top clues have both 0 and 1; upper left fill extends to col 6 under specific 2 placements; long mid (rows 8-26, cols 6-10) requires both 1 in mid and 2 in far right; row 17 mid fill depends on negation (not full_zero_left); lower far has early/late variants based on 1-left vs. (2-far and not 1-mid).
 * Order of function calls in program() matters, as fills only target 8s and later fills can overwrite if regions overlap (though current code avoids this by sequential non-overlapping regions).
 * Easy-to-miss: Fills are rectangular but sometimes partial (e.g., upper left adds col 6 conditionally); "full_zero_left" requires all three cells in rows 1-3, cols 2-4 to be 0 (not any); no fills touch clue positions (preserves 0/1/2/7/9); bottom rows 28-29 default to 2 unless top condition met; some regions like middle right (rows 12-16, cols 11-20) fill broadly if 7 in right.
 * Across attempts, issues include overfilling (e.g., filling where clues block or conditions not fully met), underfilling (e.g., missing propagations to adjacent cols like 6 or 11), ignoring negations (e.g., not full_zero_left), and mishandling "is_nine_right" (fills even if mixed non-8s). Test cases highlight sensitivity to clue interactions across vertical bands (left/mid/right).
 * No rotation or symmetry assumed; all checks are absolute positions. 8s outside defined regions may remain unfilled, but expectations show all 8s filled.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The current code uses simple any/all comprehensions for conditions, which are helpful for quick regional checks. No complex types or extractions needed yet, but potential for region-specific validators.

```python
def has_zero_top(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(22))  # Checks entire top band for 0 (helpful for global top/bottom trigger)

def is_nine_right(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    non_eight = [g[r][c] for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(12, 15) if g[r][c] != 8]
    return len(non_eight) > 0 and all(x == 9 for x in non_eight)  # Useful for strict "all clues are 9" without 8s interfering

def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], r_start: int, r_end: int, c_start: int, c_end: int, val: int) -> None:
    for r in range(r_start, r_end + 1):
        for c in range(c_start, c_end + 1):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = val  # Core filling tool; only targets 8s, preserves clues
```

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but `fill_upper_far` relies on `is_nine_right` which may misfire if region has 8s mixed with non-9s (it collects non-8s correctly but assumes presence implies fill—subtle bug in some cases). `fill_row17_mid` uses complex negation which failed in Train3/5. No object extraction functions present or needed; simple grid iteration suffices.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train1: Correct—properly filled top/bottom bands with 3s (due to 0/1 top presence), upper/middle/lower regions with 3s based on 2-left, 1-mid, 7-right, etc.; no over/underfills observed.
 * Train2: Incorrect—generated extra 3s in row7 cols6-10 (should be 8s, as no long_mid trigger without 2-far?); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left requires full_zero_left, which isn't met); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (condition (has_one_mid and not full_zero_left) or any_two_mid not fully satisfied); row22 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (no upper_left propagation?); overall, overfilled mid/left regions without strict conditions.
 * Train3: Incorrect—underfilled row7 (expected 3s in cols1-5, but generated 8s—upper_left missed due to no 2-left? Wait, clues have 2s there); row11 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_left overtriggered); row16 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle regions missed); row17 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s in cols6-10 only? No, expectations show row17 all 8s except mid 3s—generated missed mid; row18 cols1-5 filled 3s but expected 8s initially then propagated; bottom rows 30-31 are 2s as expected but top clues lacked 0/1 pair? Major issue: left/mid fills inconsistent with negations and propagations.
 * Train4: Correct—handled complex interactions like 1-left triggering lower_far_early, 2-top for lower_mid, etc.; all regions filled precisely without extras.
 * Train5: Incorrect—row12 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (middle_mid triggered wrongly without strict 1-mid?); row16 cols1-5 filled 8s but expected 3s (middle_left missed); row17 cols6-10 filled 3s but expected 8s (row17_mid overtriggered); row21 cols1-5 and cols6-10 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_left/mid missed due to no 2-left/top?); row22 all 8s but expected partial 3s in lower; overfilled some right regions with 3s where 8s expected (e.g., row8-11 cols16-20).
 * General: Conditions like full_zero_left and negations (not full_zero_left) often fail, leading to missed or extra mid fills; upper_far works when 9s present but not if mixed; long_mid undertriggers without 2-far; no function for extracting full clue regions (e.g., to validate blob shapes), which might help debug; fill order causes no overwrites but misses chained fills (e.g., upper to middle).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look fully correct—while top/bottom bands are properly 3s (due to 0-top and 1-top present), and some regions like upper left (rows8-11 cols1-5=3s), middle mid (rows12-16 cols6-10=3s), lower left/mid (rows18-21 cols1-5/6-10=3s) match expectations, there are mismatches: row7 cols1-5 are 8s but should be 3s (upper_left trigger from 2-left present, but code's any_two_left should catch it—possible col range issue in fill_upper_left); row12 cols1-5 filled 3s but if not full_zero_left (clues show mixed 0s), expected 8s; row22 cols16-20 filled 8s but expected 3s (lower_far_late should trigger from 2-far and not 1-mid? Clues have 2s far right); row24-26 cols16-20 partial 3s but code filled full, mismatching sparse 2-clue positions; overall, underfills vertical propagations (e.g., row22-26 left/mid should chain from upper) and overfills bottom mid without negation check; does not make complete sense as some 8s remain (e.g., row7, row22 partial), violating full-fill expectation, and ignores subtle extensions like col6 in upper left.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle (30 rows by 22 columns) where numbers 0-9 appear in specific "clue" positions to indicate shapes or objects (like letters A/B/C/D), and the program must detect these patterns to fill surrounding unfilled cells (marked as 8) with green (3) or red (2) in targeted strips or regions, following conditional rules for completeness, partial matches, and interactions between regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid has fixed regions: left (cols 2-5, rows 1-3 for zeros/ones/twos), window (cols 7-10, rows 1-3 for ones/twos/fours), middle (cols 12-15, rows 1-3 for sevens/nines/twos), right (cols 17-20, rows 1-3 for sixes/twos). These detect "objects" like solid/partial left zeros (for A/B/C presence), window types (1 for green triggers, 2's count >=5 for partial B), and specific numbers like 7/6 for full B, 9 for right A, 4 for left C, 1 left for right C.
 * Filling is regional and ordered: top rows 0-4 always green if zero-left + one-window; bottom rows 28-29 green (3) only if zero-left + one-window, else red (2); B area (rows 12-16) fills full/partial based on solid zeros + window/seven/six or twos; middle strip (cols 6-11, rows 7-27 or subsets) fills if partial/solid zeros + one-window, but skips if no zero-left; left A (rows 7-11, cols 1-6), left C (rows 17-21, cols 1-6), middle C (rows 17-21, cols 6-11), right D (rows 22-26, cols 16-21 if twos right + no one-window), right A (rows 7-11, cols 16-21 if nine middle), right C (rows 17-21, cols 16-21 if one left).
 * Subtleties: "Solid zero left" requires all 9 cells zero (rows 1-3, cols 2-4? but code uses 2-5, possible off-by-one); "partial" is 1-8 zeros; fillings replace only 8's with 3 (green), preserving other numbers; order matters (e.g., B fills before middle strips, potentially overwriting); no filling if conditions not met exactly (e.g., has_zero_left is any, not solid); bottom color is global but depends only on top-left/window; unhelpful to fill non-8 cells or outside regions; interactions like no zero-left blocks some middle fills but allows others (e.g., fill_middle_strip_B if one-window and not zero-left).
 * Easy to miss: Row ranges for B include 12-16 but code does 13-17 or 12-16 inconsistently (partial does 12-16, full 13-16); right D requires NOT one-window (subtle negation); window checks are rows 1-3 but fillings span rows 7-27; top/bottom are full-row fills but only if exact combo; preserve borders (col 0/21 often 8 or unchanged); partial B needs >=5 twos in window, not any; code has off-by-one in ranges (e.g., right six is cols 18-20, but has_six_right checks 18-20 any, but fill uses 16-21).
 * All considerations: Detect before filling to avoid side-effects; use copy of grid (out = [row[:] for row in g]); conditions are AND/OR combos (e.g., B full: solid zero + one-window + seven middle + six right); no red fills except bottom; green everywhere else; unhelpful functions like has_two_window (counts >=5, but used in partial B) if miscounted; broken if ranges don't match expected (e.g., B row 12 missed).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def has_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Detects any zero in left for triggers

def solid_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return all(g[r][c] == 0 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5))  # Strict all 9 zeros for full B

def has_partial_zero_left(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_zeros = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(2, 5) if g[r][c] == 0)
    return 0 < num_zeros < 9  # Partial for middle strip all

def has_one_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    return any(g[r][c] == 1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10))  # Key for green top/bottom/middle

def has_two_window(g: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    num_twos = sum(1 for r in range(1, 4) for c in range(7, 10) if g[r][c] == 2)
    return num_twos >= 5  # For partial B, subtle threshold

# Example filling helper (useful for regional replaces)
def fill_region(out: List[List[int]], rows: range, cols_start: int, cols_end: int, color: int):
    for r in rows:
        for c in range(cols_start, cols_end):
            if out[r][c] == 8:
                out[r][c] = color
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Train 1 incorrect: Generated missed filling row 12 (index 12) with 3's across cols 1-20 (expected full green strip for B top), but filled rows 13-15 correctly; likely fill_B_full/partial range wrong (code does range(13,17) for full, missing row 12; partial does 12-17 but condition not met due to has_one_window true but perhaps solid_zero_left false or missing seven/six check adjustment).
 * Train 2 correct: All fillings matched, including B partial/full, middle strips, left/right A/C, top/bottom green; conditions like partial zero + one-window triggered middle_strip_all properly.
 * Train 3 correct: Similar to 2, detected two-left for left A, nine-middle for right A, one-left for right C without overfilling.
 * Train 4 incorrect: Generated missed middle strip fill (cols 6-10) in row 17 (index 17) with 3's (expected for C middle? but code fill_middle_C is rows 17-21 cols 6-11 if has_two_middle, which may not trigger); also row 16 left/middle/right partially mismatched (generated has left cols 1-5 3's and right cols 12-20 3's, but expected adds middle cols 6-10 3's in row 17 and adjusts row 16/21); bottom correctly red (2) due to no zero-left + one-window; fill_middle_strip_B may have triggered wrongly or order issue blocked fill_middle_C; right D not filled (rows 22-26 cols 16-21) but expected none.
 * Train 5 correct: Handled combinations like four-window for left C, two-middle for middle C, without extraneous fills.
 * Overall: Order of calls works for correct cases (B before middle), but misses edge row ranges (e.g., B row 12); conditions too strict/loose (e.g., has_zero_left any vs solid); no extraction of full objects (just position checks), which is helpful but insufficient for complex shapes; unhelpful/broken: fill_right_D condition (has_two_right and not has_one_window) didn't trigger in train 4 where expected partial fill in row 17+; has_six_right checks cols 18-20 but fill uses 16-21, potential mismatch; fill_top_green and bottom work consistently but depend on fragile zero+one combo.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense but does not look fully correct: Top rows 0-4 and bottom 28-29 correctly green (3) due to zero-left + one-window (visible zeros in rows 1-3 cols 2-4, ones in window cols 7-9); B area rows 13-15 filled green in left/middle/right (cols 1-5,6-11? no, code fills 1-6 left, 6-11 mid, but generated shows cols 1-5 7's preserved, 6-11 1's preserved, 12-15 empty? wait, row 13: [8,8,7,8,8,8,8,1,1,1,8,8,8,6,6,8,8,0,0,0,8,8] unchanged except perhaps borders, but expected likely needs B fill since solid? zeros but window has 1's, middle 9's not 7, right 2's not 6— so no B full/partial, correct no fill there; row 12 all 8's correct (no trigger); right fills in rows 7-11 cols 16-20 with 3's around 9's (has_nine_middle true, triggers fill_right_A correctly); but misses left A (rows 7-11 cols 1-5, has two-left? test has 2's in row 8/10 cols 2-4, so should fill but generated all 8's there—condition has_two_left any, but not triggered?); middle strip rows 7-27 cols 6-11 partially filled (row 7 right-misplaced 3's? [...,8,8,3,3,3,3,3,8] cols 16-20), but row 13-15 cols 6-11 unfilled despite partial zero + one-window; C area rows 17-21: left/mid/right unfilled (has_four_window? test row 18-20 has 4's left? no, 4's in row 18 col2/4, but window has 2's row18 cols7-8, not 4; has_one_left? row13-15 has 1's window but left 7's not 1; so no left_C/mid_C/right_C, correct no fill); row 22-26 unfilled correct (no two_right or negation); subtle issue: row 7 has extra 3's in cols 16-20, but fill_right_A is rows7-11, yes, but why cols16-20 only partial? code replaces 8's with 3; overall, output misses left A fill and middle strip despite conditions, suggesting broken range or order (e.g., fill_middle_strip_all should trigger for partial zero + one_window, filling rows7-27 cols6-11 with 3's over 8's, but generated doesn't); does not fully match expected logic, as B/C interactions seem underfilled.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.
