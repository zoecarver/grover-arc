=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 18:58:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

**High level:** This puzzle involves extracting and classifying 4x4 colored shapes (solids or frames) from an input grid, sorting them by top-left position, pairing frames on the left side with solids on the right side in horizontal 8-column blocks, and stacking these pairs vertically to form the output grid, padding with empty (all-0) left or right sides if the numbers of frames and solids differ.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes must be exactly 4x4 in bounding box; anything larger, smaller, or irregularly shaped is ignored.
 * Frames are hollow with colored borders (top/bottom full rows, left/right sides excluding corners) and empty interior (no color in the inner 2x2+ area); solids are fully filled with the color.
 * Colors are positive integers; 0 represents empty/background and is ignored for extraction.
 * Sorting is by (min_row, min_col) to process shapes in top-to-bottom, left-to-right order.
 * Number of pairs is the maximum of frames or solids count; unpaired shapes get an empty counterpart (all 0s on the opposite side), ensuring even stacking in 4-row increments.
 * Output is always 8 columns wide; left 4 columns for frames (or empty), right 4 for solids (or empty).
 * Subtlety: Frame classification strictly checks borders full and interior completely empty—any interior color or incomplete border disqualifies it as a frame.
 * Subtlety: Multiple shapes of the same color are treated separately if disconnected, but the code assumes connected regions per color.
 * Consideration: If input has no shapes or unbalanced counts, output may have empty blocks, but training examples suggest balanced or specific padding.
 * Easy to miss: The frame interior check excludes the borders but requires no stray colors inside; solids must have no 0s or other colors in the 4x4 box.
 * Easy to miss: Positions are 0-indexed; bounding box must exactly match 4x4 after min/max calculation.
 * All attempts (this single one) assume only 4x4 shapes; non-4x4 colored regions are skipped, which worked for training but may miss partial or overlapping shapes in test.
 * Padding with empty sides preserves structure but may lead to all-0 left blocks if more solids than frames.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Tuple

def extract_color_regions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    color_pos: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]] = {}
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return color_pos
    cols = len(g[0])
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            color = g[r][c]
            if color > 0:
                if color not in color_pos:
                    color_pos[color] = []
                color_pos[color].append((r, c))
    return color_pos
```
(This extracts positions per color, essential for finding bounding boxes; helpful for identifying all potential shapes.)

```python
def classify_shape(g: List[List[int]], min_r: int, max_r: int, min_c: int, max_c: int, color: int) -> str:
    # Check if solid
    is_solid = True
    for rr in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for cc in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            if g[rr][cc] != color:
                is_solid = False
                break
        if not is_solid:
            break
    if is_solid:
        return 'solid'
    # Check if frame
    # Top row
    if any(g[min_r][cc] != color for cc in range(min_c, max_c + 1)):
        return None
    # Bottom row
    if any(g[max_r][cc] != color for cc in range(min_c, max_c + 1)):
        return None
    # Left side
    if any(g[rr][min_c] != color for rr in range(min_r + 1, max_r)):
        return None
    # Right side
    if any(g[rr][max_c] != color for rr in range(min_r + 1, max_r)):
        return None
    # Inner area empty
    if any(g[rr][cc] != 0 for rr in range(min_r + 1, max_r) for cc in range(min_c + 1, max_c)):
        return None
    return 'frame'
```
(This classifies shapes accurately for 4x4; critical for distinguishing solid vs. frame; the inner check is subtle and correctly handles hollowness.)

```python
def sort_shapes(shapes: List[Tuple[int, int, int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int]]:
    return sorted(shapes, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
```
(Simple but key for positional ordering; uses (row, col) of top-left.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly handled training examples 1-4 by extracting, classifying, sorting, and pairing shapes into 8-column blocks with proper frame/solid rendering and padding.
 * Worked well for balanced frame/solid counts in training, producing exact 4-row pair blocks stacked vertically.
 * What worked: extract_color_regions reliably finds positions; classify_shape correctly identifies solids (full fill) and frames (border-only with empty interior); build_pair_rows renders frames with top/bottom full and sides partial, solids full.
 * What didn't work: In test, it produced empty left sides for unpaired solids (pairs 3 and 4), which may not match expected output if the puzzle requires only paired shapes, min(count) pairs, or unpaired solids placed differently (e.g., solo on left or stacked without empty padding).
 * Sorting by top-left position worked for training but may misorder shapes in test if positions overlap or if test has more solids than frames, leading to unnecessary empty blocks.
 * Assumes frames always pair left/solids right; if test expects flexible pairing or all shapes sorted together, this fixed left-frame/right-solid biases the output.
 * build_pair_rows is helpful but inflexible—renders empty left as all 0s, which bloats output to max(count) pairs; training likely had equal counts, so it passed.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all are relevant, though classify_shape returns None for non-frame/non-solid, which silently skips invalid shapes (good, but could log for debugging).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output creates 4 stacked 4-row pairs (16 rows total), with the first two pairs correctly showing frame on left (color 4 and 2, with proper hollow rendering: full top/bottom, sides only) and solid on right (color 6 and 7, full fill).
 * Pairs 3 and 4 have empty left (all 0s across 4 columns, all rows) and solid right (color 1 and 8, full fill with identical rows), which makes sense per the code's padding logic if test input has 2 frames and 4 solids sorted as such.
 * However, the test output does not look fully correct: the empty left blocks for pairs 3-4 add unnecessary all-0 space, potentially differing from expected if the puzzle wants only min(frames, solids) pairs (8 rows) plus unpaired solids rendered solo (e.g., full-width or right-aligned without empty left). This is different from training, which passed likely due to balanced counts—no empties observed.
 * Colors appear in order 4(frame)-6(solid), 2(frame)-7(solid), 1(solid)-empty(left but shown as empty left), 8(solid)-empty; if test input positions sort solids as 6,7,1,8 after frames 4,2, this matches code but may mismatch expected if sorting should interleave or pair by color/proximity.
 * Overall, the structure is consistent (8 cols, 4-row blocks), but the unpaired handling (empty left) likely causes mismatch—expected might omit empties or place unpaired below pairs, resulting in non-16-row output or different layout.
 * Specific difference: Rows 9-12 and 13-16 are all-0 left with full right, but if expected pairs only existing shapes without padding, this bloats and shifts content; unknown if test input has exactly these shapes, but output implies more solids than frames.
