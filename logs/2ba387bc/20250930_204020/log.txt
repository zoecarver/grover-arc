=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 20:40:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:45:59] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the detection and extraction of specific 4x4 patterns ("frames" with a filled border and empty interior, and "solids" fully filled with a single number) from a larger input grid of numbers. The goal is to collect these patterns in row-major order, pair corresponding frames and solids (padding with empties if needed), and output a concatenated 8-column grid where each pair's rows are combined side-by-side.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns must be exactly 4x4 subgrids, extracted from every possible top-left position (r from 0 to h-4, c from 0 to w-4) to cover overlapping or adjacent placements.
 * Frames require a consistent non-zero border value 'c' on all four edges (top/bottom rows fully 'c', left/right columns fully 'c' on middle rows), with the inner 2x2 completely empty (0), and no other non-zero values anywhere; all-zero subgrids are invalid as frames.
 * Solids require every cell in the 4x4 to be the exact same non-zero value 'c', with no zeros or variations allowed.
 * Detected frames and solids are collected separately, sorted by their top-left (r, c) position in row-major order, and paired sequentially up to the maximum count between the two lists; shorter lists are padded with 4x4 zero grids.
 * Concatenation combines rows element-wise (left pattern + right pattern to make 1x8 rows), producing a block of 4 rows per pair; multiple pairs stack vertically into the final output.
 * Subtlety: Padding with all-zero 4x4 grids for missing patterns (e.g., more solids than frames) results in output rows with leading zeros, which may not align with puzzle expectations if the goal is to only output actual detected patterns without artificial empties.
 * Overlaps are possible but handled by extracting all valid subgrids independently; no merging or de-duplication is performed.
 * Input grid may have varying sizes, but output is always in 4-row blocks per pair, with total height = 4 * max(frames, solids count); empty input returns empty list.
 * Easy to miss: Frame validation strictly checks inner 2x2 zeros and border consistency, but allows middle rows to have zeros in columns 1-2 only; solids reject any zero or inconsistency immediately.
 * No handling for patterns larger/smaller than 4x4, or non-integer values; assumes grid is rectangular list of lists of ints.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

        for i in range(4):
            out.append(left[i] + right[i])
    return out
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) successfully passed all 4 training examples, indicating correct detection of frames and solids, proper extraction, sorting by position, pairing, and row concatenation.
 * What worked: Frame validation correctly enforces border consistency and inner empty check; solid validation ensures uniformity; subgrid extraction handles boundaries; output format matches expected 1x8 row lists stacked for each pair.
 * What didn't work: No explicit issues in training, but the program uses all-zero padding for unpaired patterns, which could lead to invalid or unintended output blocks (e.g., empty "frames" that don't represent real puzzle elements).
 * Sorting by (r, c) works for row-major order but may mispair if frames and solids are not intended to be strictly positional (e.g., if pairing should be by value or proximity rather than index).
 * The elif in detection prioritizes solids over frames for overlapping subgrids, which might miss a frame if a subgrid qualifies as both (though unlikely, as solids have no zeros).
 * No unhelpful functions identified; all provided (extract_subgrid, is_valid_frame, is_valid_solid, program) are relevant and functional, though frame/solid checks could be optimized for edge cases like partial borders.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output consists of 4 blocks (16 rows total), each 1x8: first block pairs a valid 4-frame (border 4's, inner zeros) with a 6-solid (all 6's); second pairs a 2-frame with a 7-solid; third and fourth pair all-zero "frames" (padded) with 1-solid and 8-solid, respectively, resulting in leading [0,0,0,0] in every row of those blocks.
 * The test output does not look fully correct: While the first two blocks appear valid and sensible (matching expected frame-solid pairs), the third and fourth blocks include artificial all-zero left sides, which resemble invalid patterns (since all-zero subgrids fail frame validation) and may not align with puzzle rules expecting only actual detected objects without padding— this creates "empty" pairs that dilute the output and look like artifacts rather than meaningful puzzle elements.
 * Observed effect: Padding leads to 8 rows of leading zeros paired with solids, differing from an expected output that might omit unpaired solids, pair differently (e.g., only when both exist), or treat zeros as non-output; unknown if the test input grid actually contains 4 frames (unlikely, given padding) or if positional sorting mismatched pairs.
 * The solids (1's and 8's) are correctly uniform, but the overall structure suggests over-inclusion of blocks, potentially making the output longer or less precise than needed.
