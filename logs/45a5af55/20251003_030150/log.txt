=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 03:01:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

    border_color = grid[0][0]
    thickness = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while thickness < n and all(cell == border_color for cell in grid[thickness]):
        thickness += 1
    content = grid[thickness:] if thickness < n else []
    return border_color, thickness, content

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 03:23:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving square grids composed of concentric frames (borders) with uniform colors and thicknesses, where the input grid encodes an outer border followed by vertical "stripes" (likely representing inner frame layers) visible primarily in one column (e.g., the left side of the content area). The goal is to parse the outer border, extract the sequence of inner stripes from the content area, and reconstruct a new output grid by building these frames from the innermost layer outward, then wrapping with the outer border to form a complete symmetric square.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The outer border is a uniform color layer of consistent thickness across all four sides (top, bottom, left, right), extracted by checking initial rows for uniformity; thickness is the number of leading rows fully matching the border color.
 * After removing the outer border, the "content" is the remaining subgrid; stripes are extracted solely from the leftmost column of this content (row[0] for each content row), assuming these represent the sequence of inner frame colors and heights (thicknesses) from outer to inner.
 * Stripes are sequences of consecutive same-color blocks in this left column, each as (color, height/thickness); this assumes vertical uniformity but ignores horizontal variations or inner content that might disrupt the column.
 * Reconstruction reverses the stripes to start from the innermost frame, building square grids iteratively by adding uniform frames around the current inner grid: each new frame expands the size by 2*thickness, offsets the inner grid, and fills the new border areas uniformly with the frame color on all sides (including corners, which may overwrite).
 * The final output adds the outer border around the fully built inner grid, ensuring the total size is inner_size + 2*border_thickness.
 * Subtlety: Assumes all frames are perfect squares with uniform thickness on all sides; does not handle asymmetries, "openings" in frames, or inner non-frame content (e.g., blobs or patterns that break uniformity in the extraction column).
 * Subtlety: If content height is 0, output is just the bordered empty grid; if stripes are empty, inner grid is empty.
 * Key consideration: The left-column extraction works for simple nested uniform frames but fails for complex inputs where inner layers have horizontal interruptions, embedded sub-structures, or non-vertical patterns, leading to incorrect stripe sequences.
 * Consideration: All grids are square (n x n); output must match input size or derived size based on thicknesses.
 * Easy to miss: Reversing stripes for inside-out building; handling zero-size inner grids; ensuring offsets place inner content without overlap or gaps; corners in frame filling are handled by separate top/bottom and left/right fills, which may cause minor overwrites but ensure uniformity in simple cases.
 * Across attempts (this being the primary one shown): No handling for cases where the "stripes" column doesn't represent full frames (e.g., if inner content protrudes or varies horizontally); no validation that reconstructed grid matches input dimensions or symmetry.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def get_border_info(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int, List[List[int]]]:
    """Extract border color, thickness, and content grid. Assumes uniform top rows define border."""
    if not grid:
        return 0, 0, []
    border_color = grid[0][0]
    thickness = 0
    n = len(grid)
    while thickness < n and all(cell == border_color for cell in grid[thickness]):
        thickness += 1
    content = grid[thickness:] if thickness < n else []
    return border_color, thickness, content
```
(This is helpful for initial border parsing in uniform cases.)

```python
def get_stripes(content: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    """Extract stripes (color, height) from left column of content grid, outer to inner."""
    if not content:
        return []
    stripes = []
    current_c = content[0][0]
    current_t = 1
    for row in content[1:]:
        c = row[0]
        if c == current_c:
            current_t += 1
        else:
            stripes.append((current_c, current_t))
            current_c = c
            current_t = 1
    stripes.append((current_c, current_t))
    return stripes
```
(This is helpful for extracting vertical stripe sequences but limited to left column only; not useful for horizontal or complex patterns.)

```python
def compose_full_grid(border_color: int, thickness: int, inner_grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Compose full output grid by adding uniform outer border around inner grid."""
    inner_size = len(inner_grid) if inner_grid else 0
    total_size = inner_size + 2 * thickness
    full_grid = [[border_color for _ in range(total_size)] for _ in range(total_size)]
    if inner_size > 0:
        offset = thickness
        for i in range(inner_size):
            for j in range(inner_size):
                full_grid[offset + i][offset + j] = inner_grid[i][j]
    return full_grid
```
(This is helpful for final assembly and works well for uniform borders.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one detailed) correctly parsed and reconstructed simple uniform concentric frames, as evidenced by passing Training example 1 and 2.
 * Worked for cases with purely nested uniform layers where the left column accurately represents all frame thicknesses without interruptions.
 * Did not work for complex test input, where inner structures include non-uniform elements (e.g., partial columns of colors like 2s interrupted by inner frames of 3s, 7s, 5s); the left-column stripe extraction likely misinterprets the sequence, leading to incorrect frame building.
 * build_inner_grid function assumes uniform square frames and fills entire sides, but generates irregular patterns in output (e.g., mismatched thicknesses across rows), indicating it breaks when input has embedded sub-grids or asymmetries.
 * get_stripes is essential for simple vertical stripe extraction but is insufficient/not helpful for puzzles with horizontal variations or inner objects; it ignores the full row content, so don't use it without augmentation for complex cases.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core border/stripe parsing but misses handling of nested non-frame elements (e.g., the 5s and 8s interruptions inside 7s in test output).
 * The reversal of stripes for inside-out building is a key insight that worked for training but led to misalignment in test (e.g., unknown reason for why inner 3s appear as thin horizontal bars instead of full frames).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it produces a 26x26 grid with an outer border of 3s (thickness 2, uniform on all sides, which matches expected for simple borders), but the inner content is highly irregular and asymmetric, with vertical strips of 8s and 2s that vary in width across rows (e.g., row 6 has 17 consecutive 2s flanked by 3-wide 8s, while row 9 has only single 2s separated by 2-wide 8s and 8-wide 3s).
 * Inner layers show non-uniform frames, such as a horizontal band of 3s (rows 8-9,17-18) that interrupts the 8s and 2s, and embedded rectangular-ish areas of 7s (rows 9-16) containing inner 5s and 8s (e.g., row 12 has 5,8,8,5 inside 7s, creating a non-square "window" effect), which do not align with the code's uniform square-frame building logic.
 * Expected output should likely be a clean reconstruction with symmetric, uniform concentric layers based on the input's stripe sequence, but this generated version has "leaks" or misplacements (e.g., 2s forming tall thin columns in some areas but full-width bands in others; 5s appearing as small clusters rather than full frames), suggesting the stripe extraction or frame-adding process failed to capture the test input's complexity.
 * The output makes partial sense as an attempt at frame reconstruction (e.g., overall square structure with color layering), but it is visibly broken due to row-to-row inconsistencies that break symmetry—e.g., the 7-region is roughly centered but has asymmetric 8s inside (row 13: 5,8,8,5 vs. surrounding 7s), which wouldn't occur in correct uniform building; this difference is likely due to the code's left-column-only extraction missing horizontal details in the test input.
 * No empty or zero-size handling issues apparent, but the total size (26x26) implies derived from thicknesses summing to that, yet the irregularities indicate a mismatch from expected clean nesting.
