=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 03:40:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 03:56:38] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), and the goal is to generate a larger, symmetric output grid that embeds and transforms the input's row-based color blocks into a framed, nested, and mirrored structure, often with borders, pivots, and recursive sub-patterns that expand or contract widths while maintaining symmetry.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid's rows have dominant colors; extract these as "row_colors" by taking the first cell of each row, assuming uniform or representative colors per row.
 * Identify horizontal blocks of consecutive same colors in row_colors to detect structures like top/bottom borders (e.g., height 2, color 8) or symmetric layers.
 * Output must be perfectly symmetric vertically and horizontally within layers, with mirroring of upper sections and sub-blocks; failures often occur in asymmetric placements or incorrect width calculations for centers/flanks.
 * Handle borders by adding fixed-width frames (e.g., width 2, color 8) around inner content, reducing effective columns accordingly; without borders, no framing.
 * Use a "pivot" block (first height-1 block) to split the structure into upper (pre-pivot, expanding flanks), side (pivot with nested sub-blocks), and mirrored lower sections.
 * Sub-blocks after pivot require recursive nesting: start with full-width sub-row, then iteratively insert new segments by shrinking center width (subtract 2*previous height), adding symmetric flanks of old color/height, ensuring even widths and minimum center of 2 if negative.
 * Mirroring sub-blocks: reverse the sub-blocks list, but adjust for borders (full reverse) vs. no borders (exclude last if needed); repeat rows per block height.
 * Width calculations are critical: total width is often 2 * effective_cols (+ border adjustments); centers = 2*(eff_cols - flank_width - deltas); extra +1 for borders in pivot.
 * Symmetry breaks easily in flanks (built from prior blocks) or sub-configs (flattening segments); ensure reversed flanks match exactly.
 * For non-bordered cases, skip border logic but maintain pivot/side/mirror; inputs may have varying heights/widths, so compute dynamically.
 * Subtle: In sub-nesting, when updating segments, replace only the center segment with left_flank + new + right_flank; track heights for repetition.
 * In pivot side, add pivot-colored sides of width = pivot_height around sub-content.
 * Outer flanks for side include all pre-pivot blocks + border extra if applicable.
 * Easy to miss: Minimum widths (e.g., new_width=2 if <=0), even flank splits ((old_width - new_width)//2), and handling empty sub_blocks (no side content).
 * Outputs must match exact cell values; small shifts in 1's, 2's, or 6's/8's indicate width miscalculations or wrong pivot selection.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_row_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    return [row[0] for row in g]  # Assumes first cell represents row color; helpful for block extraction.
```

```python
def get_blocks(row_colors: List[int]) -> List[tuple]:
    blocks = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row_colors)
    while i < n:
        c = row_colors[i]
        j = i + 1
        while j < n and row_colors[j] == c:
            j += 1
        h = j - i
        blocks.append((h, c))
        i = j
    return blocks  # Essential for identifying layers like borders or pivots.
```

```python
def add_border(inner: List[int], border_w: int, border_c: int) -> List[int]:
    if border_w > 0:
        return [border_c] * border_w + inner + [border_c] * border_w
    return inner  # Useful for framing rows; apply per row in output construction.
```

```python
def flatten_segments(segments: List[tuple]) -> List[int]:
    flat = []
    for ww, cc, _ in segments:
        flat += [cc] * ww
    return flat  # Helpful for building sub-rows from nested (width, color, height) segments.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects borders (e.g., top 2 rows of 8's in train 1) and adds framing, producing correct top/bottom 8-rows and initial 2-block rows.
 * Pivot selection (first h=1 block) works partially, building upper sections with expanding flanks and centers of correct color/length in broad strokes.
 * Symmetry in mirroring upper to lower is implemented but fails in sub-sections due to incomplete side mirroring (e.g., train 1 misses extra 1's and shifts 2's in lower half).
 * Sub-nesting logic attempts recursive insertion but errs in segment replacement: in train 1, row 7 has 6's starting too late (positions 8-17 vs. expected 6-19), and inner 1's/2's are asymmetrically placed (e.g., row 10: 1's at 11-14 vs. expected 10-15; row 12: extra 2's at 12-13 but missing width).
 * In train 1, side section has incorrect sub-available width or flank additions, leading to 8's intruding into 1/2 areas (e.g., row 9: 8's at 9-16 vs. expected all 8's but shifted 1's); unknown why pivot extra=1 causes over-narrowing.
 * Train 2 (no border) correctly builds basic 3/2 layers but fails in side: extra rows of 1's (e.g., rows 14-16 have 1's where expected 2's), and misplaced 8's in row 11-12 (should be 2's per expected).
 * Mirroring in train 2 repeats side incorrectly (e.g., lines 14-16 duplicate upper patterns instead of proper reverse sub-blocks), and bottom 3's are mismatched in count/position.
 * Function get_blocks is helpful and correct for layer detection.
 * add_border works for bordered cases but unneeded (correctly skipped) in train 2.
 * flatten_segments is useful but buggy in iterative updates: doesn't preserve total width, causing shrinks (e.g., train 1 sub-row widths drop below expected).
 * The pivot_h used for side_width=pivot_h is correct conceptually but leads to over-narrowing in sub_available = pivot_center_len - 2*side_width.
 * Overall, core structure (upper + side + mirror) is grasped, but width deltas/extras and segment iteration are off, causing all mismatches.
 * No types defined beyond List; could add Tuple[int, int] for blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense structurally (symmetric top/bottom 3's as apparent border/non-border, 8's as inner frame, nested 2/3/7/5 patterns), but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules inferred from trainings.
 * It correctly frames with 3's (width 2?) and inner 8's (expanding from row 2), with a pivot-like 2-block (rows 5-6,20-21) and sub-nesting (3's then 7's with inner 5's/8's), but asymmetries appear: e.g., row 8 has 3's at 8-9 and 16-17 but expected symmetry might require even placement; row 12 has 5's only at 10-11 (narrow, possibly wrong shrink); row 13-14 insert 8's in 7's center incorrectly (should be sub-color or empty?).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Likely too many repetitions of inner patterns (e.g., rows 9-10,12-13,15-16 duplicate without height-based variation); 5's appear but may be misplaced (trainings suggest 1/2 infills, not 5); bottom mirroring incomplete (rows 22-25 revert to 8's too early, missing sub-mirror). Widths seem consistent (22 cols), but center calculations off, causing 8's to "leak" into subs (e.g., row 7: 8's at 6-7 and 16-17 vs. pure 2's expected).
 * To handle test: Ensure sub-nesting accounts for new colors (3,7,5) by generalizing blocks; fix mirroring to include full reverse without extras; verify pivot_center_len subtracts correctly for non-8 borders.

[2025-10-02 03:56:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 04:12:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid, and the key sequence is extracted from its first column as a list of colors (representing layers from outer to inner). The output is a larger square grid (size 2*len(sequence)-2) constructed by filling concentric perimeters/borders with groups of consecutive colors from the sequence, handling thicknesses based on group sizes, inner fills with subsequent colors, and a final center bar, with any unfilled areas defaulting to a background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The sequence c is groups of consecutive identical colors; each group's count determines the "thickness" t of the border layer (e.g., t=2 means 2 rows/columns thick).
 * Borders are set as perimeters: top and bottom rows filled across the inner width (excluding corners if needed), left and right columns filled vertically across the full height of the current layer, but with offsets to avoid overwriting previous layers (e.g., start after outer layers).
 * Inner areas after the first layer are filled with the next color's group as a solid rectangle, but only after processing the first group; this creates nested frames.
 * For the innermost (last) group, use a horizontal center bar instead of a full perimeter.
 * Grid size s = 2*h - 2 where h=len(c); layers shrink inward by 2*t each time (top+bottom or left+right).
 * Unfilled cells (0s) are backfilled with the first inner color (after the outermost) or fallback to c[0].
 * Subtle: Perimeter filling skips the outermost corners for inner layers to maintain clean borders; left/right sides start/end at current_start +1 to end-1 for tops/bottoms.
 * Easy to miss: Alignment issues cause outer colors to bleed into inner areas (e.g., sides not properly offset); center bar width is min(2, size) or full if small; no diagonal or non-rectangular fills.
 * Group processing is sequential (i increments through c), updating current_start and shrinking current_size after each layer.
 * If h=1, likely full grid of that color; handle empty or zero-size layers by skipping.
 * Background fill only at end, but avoid overwriting valid fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; both training examples failed due to misalignment in perimeter setting (e.g., in Train 1, outer sides are 2 instead of 8, inner 6/1 sections have extra 8s bleeding in, and top/bottom borders incomplete; in Train 2, outer frame is 3 but inner fills wrong with misplaced 2s and 8s not matching expected 2 outer).
 * Missed proper inner rectangle fill after first group: code attempts it but uses next_col incorrectly (fills with upcoming color too early/wrong bounds, causing overlaps like 8s in 6 areas in Train 1).
 * Perimeter function broken: left/right j-ranges too narrow (e.g., left_end_j = current_start + t limits vertical sides to only t columns instead of full height, leading to unfilled side areas backfilled wrongly).
 * Group counting correct (while loop for consecutive), but shrinking current_size -=2*t assumes symmetric borders, which works in concept but fails with offsets.
 * Center bar applied only for last group (good), but in Train 1, no clear center bar visible in generated (possibly overwritten).
 * Background fill with c[first_t] (after first layer) is a good idea but over-applies to valid areas (e.g., fills inner 2s with wrong color in Train 1).
 * extract_colors is correct and helpful; set_column is solid for verticals; set_perimeter and set_center_bar are partially helpful but buggy (avoid direct reuse without fixes for ranges).
 * Train 1 generated has symmetric but wrong side colors (2 on left/right where 8 expected), and mismatched inner blob (1s not centered properly, extra 2s); unknown why 1s have 2s interrupting in rows 12-13.
 * Train 2 generated has inverted outer (3 where 2 expected), and inner 8s appear erroneously in center (not in expected); fill after first group places 3s wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has an outer frame of 3s with 8s on sides/corners mismatched (e.g., top rows all 3 but sides 8, unlike Train 1 expected where outer is uniform 8), and inner layers show 2s then 3s/7s/5s with 8 bleeds, suggesting sequence like [8,3,2,3,7,5?] but perimeters not concentric properly (e.g., row 5 has 2s only in middle but sides 8/3 mixed).
 * Missing uniform outer border (expected likely full 8 outer like Train 1, but generated mixes 8/3); inner 7/5 sections have 8 interruptions (row 12: 5s become 8s wrongly, similar to Train 1 bleed).
 * Does not match puzzle rules: thicknesses seem off (e.g., 3-group thick? but fills not symmetric), center bar absent or thin 2s in row 20, and backfill likely wrong (zeros to 3? causing extras). Without expected, it fails patterns from trains (no clean nesting).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 04:12:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), and the goal is to generate a larger, symmetric output grid that embeds and transforms the input's row-based color blocks into a framed, nested, and mirrored structure, often with borders, pivots, and recursive sub-patterns that expand or contract widths while maintaining symmetry.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid's rows have dominant colors; extract these as "row_colors" by taking the first cell of each row, assuming uniform or representative colors per row.
 * Identify horizontal blocks of consecutive same colors in row_colors to detect structures like top/bottom borders (e.g., height 2, color 8) or symmetric layers.
 * Output must be perfectly symmetric vertically and horizontally within layers, with mirroring of upper sections and sub-blocks; failures often occur in asymmetric placements or incorrect width calculations for centers/flanks.
 * Handle borders by adding fixed-width frames (e.g., width 2, color 8) around inner content, reducing effective columns accordingly; without borders, no framing.
 * Use a "pivot" block (first height-1 block) to split the structure into upper (pre-pivot, expanding flanks), side (pivot with nested sub-blocks), and mirrored lower sections.
 * Sub-blocks after pivot require recursive nesting: start with full-width sub-row, then iteratively insert new segments by shrinking center width (subtract 2*previous height), adding symmetric flanks of old color/height, ensuring even widths and minimum center of 2 if negative.
 * Mirroring sub-blocks: reverse the sub-blocks list, but adjust for borders (full reverse) vs. no borders (exclude last if needed); repeat rows per block height.
 * Width calculations are critical: total width is often 2 * effective_cols (+ border adjustments); centers = 2*(eff_cols - flank_width - deltas); extra +1 for borders in pivot.
 * Symmetry breaks easily in flanks (built from prior blocks) or sub-configs (flattening segments); ensure reversed flanks match exactly.
 * For non-bordered cases, skip border logic but maintain pivot/side/mirror; inputs may have varying heights/widths, so compute dynamically.
 * Subtle: In sub-nesting, when updating segments, replace only the center segment with left_flank + new + right_flank; track heights for repetition.
 * In pivot side, add pivot-colored sides of width = pivot_height around sub-content.
 * Outer flanks for side include all pre-pivot blocks + border extra if applicable.
 * Easy to miss: Minimum widths (e.g., new_width=2 if <=0), even flank splits ((old_width - new_width)//2), and handling empty sub_blocks (no side content).
 * Outputs must match exact cell values; small shifts in 1's, 2's, or 6's/8's indicate width miscalculations or wrong pivot selection.

```python
def add_border(inner: List[int], border_w: int, border_c: int) -> List[int]:
    if border_w > 0:
        return [border_c] * border_w + inner + [border_c] * border_w
    return inner  # Useful for framing rows; apply per row in output construction.

def flatten_segments(segments: List[tuple]) -> List[int]:
    flat = []
    for ww, cc, _ in segments:
        flat += [cc] * ww
    return flat  # Helpful for building sub-rows from nested (width, color, height) segments.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects borders (e.g., top 2 rows of 8's in train 1) and adds framing, producing correct top/bottom 8-rows and initial 2-block rows.
 * Pivot selection (first h=1 block) works partially, building upper sections with expanding flanks and centers of correct color/length in broad strokes.
 * Symmetry in mirroring upper to lower is implemented but fails in sub-sections due to incomplete side mirroring (e.g., train 1 misses extra 1's and shifts 2's in lower half).
 * Sub-nesting logic attempts recursive insertion but errs in segment replacement: in train 1, row 7 has 6's starting too late (positions 8-17 vs. expected 6-19), and inner 1's/2's are asymmetrically placed (e.g., row 10: 1's at 11-14 vs. expected 10-15; row 12: extra 2's at 12-13 but missing width).
 * In train 1, side section has incorrect sub-available width or flank additions, leading to 8's intruding into 1/2 areas (e.g., row 9: 8's at 9-16 vs. expected all 8's but shifted 1's); unknown why pivot extra=1 causes over-narrowing.
 * Train 2 (no border) correctly builds basic 3/2 layers but fails in side: extra rows of 1's (e.g., rows 14-16 have 1's where expected 2's), and misplaced 8's in row 11-12 (should be 2's per expected).
 * Mirroring in train 2 repeats side incorrectly (e.g., lines 14-16 duplicate upper patterns instead of proper reverse sub-blocks), and bottom 3's are mismatched in count/position.
 * Function get_blocks is helpful and correct for layer detection.
 * add_border works for bordered cases but unneeded (correctly skipped) in train 2.
 * flatten_segments is useful but buggy in iterative updates: doesn't preserve total width, causing shrinks (e.g., train 1 sub-row widths drop below expected).
 * The pivot_h used for side_width=pivot_h is correct conceptually but leads to over-narrowing in sub_available = pivot_center_len - 2*side_width.
 * Overall, core structure (upper + side + mirror) is grasped, but width deltas/extras and segment iteration are off, causing all mismatches.
 * No types defined beyond List; could add Tuple[int, int] for blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense structurally (symmetric top/bottom 3's as apparent border/non-border, 8's as inner frame, nested 2/3/7/5 patterns), but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules inferred from trainings.
 * It correctly frames with 3's (width 2?) and inner 8's (expanding from row 2), with a pivot-like 2-block (rows 5-6,20-21) and sub-nesting (3's then 7's with inner 5's/8's), but asymmetries appear: e.g., row 8 has 3's at 8-9 and 16-17 but expected symmetry might require even placement; row 12 has 5's only at 10-11 (narrow, possibly wrong shrink); row 13-14 insert 8's in 7's center incorrectly (should be sub-color or empty?).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Likely too many repetitions of inner patterns (e.g., rows 9-10,12-13,15-16 duplicate without height-based variation); 5's appear but may be misplaced (trainings suggest 1/2 infills, not 5); bottom mirroring incomplete (rows 22-25 revert to 8's too early, missing sub-mirror). Widths seem consistent (22 cols), but center calculations off, causing 8's to "leak" into subs (e.g., row 7: 8's at 6-7 and 16-17 vs. pure 2's expected).
 * To handle test: Ensure sub-nesting accounts for new colors (3,7,5) by generalizing blocks; fix mirroring to include full reverse without extras; verify pivot_center_len subtracts correctly for non-8 borders.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid, and the key sequence is extracted from its first column as a list of colors (representing layers from outer to inner). The output is a larger square grid (size 2*len(sequence)-2) constructed by filling concentric perimeters/borders with groups of consecutive colors from the sequence, handling thicknesses based on group sizes, inner fills with subsequent colors, and a final center bar, with any unfilled areas defaulting to a background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The sequence c is groups of consecutive identical colors; each group's count determines the "thickness" t of the border layer (e.g., t=2 means 2 rows/columns thick).
 * Borders are set as perimeters: top and bottom rows filled across the inner width (excluding corners if needed), left and right columns filled vertically across the full height of the current layer, but with offsets to avoid overwriting previous layers (e.g., start after outer layers).
 * Inner areas after the first layer are filled with the next color's group as a solid rectangle, but only after processing the first group; this creates nested frames.
 * For the innermost (last) group, use a horizontal center bar instead of a full perimeter.
 * Grid size s = 2*h - 2 where h=len(c); layers shrink inward by 2*t each time (top+bottom or left+right).
 * Unfilled cells (0s) are backfilled with the first inner color (after the outermost) or fallback to c[0].
 * Subtle: Perimeter filling skips the outermost corners for inner layers to maintain clean borders; left/right sides start/end at current_start +1 to end-1 for tops/bottoms.
 * Easy to miss: Alignment issues cause outer colors to bleed into inner areas (e.g., sides not properly offset); center bar width is min(2, size) or full if small; no diagonal or non-rectangular fills.
 * Group processing is sequential (i increments through c), updating current_start and shrinking current_size after each layer.
 * If h=1, likely full grid of that color; handle empty or zero-size layers by skipping.
 * Background fill only at end, but avoid overwriting valid fills.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; both training examples failed due to misalignment in perimeter setting (e.g., in Train 1, outer sides are 2 instead of 8, inner 6/1 sections have extra 8s bleeding in, and top/bottom borders incomplete; in Train 2, outer frame is 3 but inner fills wrong with misplaced 2s and 8s not matching expected 2 outer).
 * Missed proper inner rectangle fill after first group: code attempts it but uses next_col incorrectly (fills with upcoming color too early/wrong bounds, causing overlaps like 8s in 6 areas in Train 1).
 * Perimeter function broken: left/right j-ranges too narrow (e.g., left_end_j = current_start + t limits vertical sides to only t columns instead of full height, leading to unfilled side areas backfilled wrongly).
 * Group counting correct (while loop for consecutive), but shrinking current_size -=2*t assumes symmetric borders, which works in concept but fails with offsets.
 * Center bar applied only for last group (good), but in Train 1, no clear center bar visible in generated (possibly overwritten).
 * Background fill with c[first_t] (after first layer) is a good idea but over-applies to valid areas (e.g., fills inner 2s with wrong color in Train 1).
 * extract_colors is correct and helpful; set_column is solid for verticals; set_perimeter and set_center_bar are partially helpful but buggy (avoid direct reuse without fixes for ranges).
 * Train 1 generated has symmetric but wrong side colors (2 on left/right where 8 expected), and mismatched inner blob (1s not centered properly, extra 2s); unknown why 1s have 2s interrupting in rows 12-13.
 * Train 2 generated has inverted outer (3 where 2 expected), and inner 8s appear erroneously in center (not in expected); fill after first group places 3s wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has an outer frame of 3s with 8s on sides/corners mismatched (e.g., top rows all 3 but sides 8, unlike Train 1 expected where outer is uniform 8), and inner layers show 2s then 3s/7s/5s with 8 bleeds, suggesting sequence like [8,3,2,3,7,5?] but perimeters not concentric properly (e.g., row 5 has 2s only in middle but sides 8/3 mixed).
 * Missing uniform outer border (expected likely full 8 outer like Train 1, but generated mixes 8/3); inner 7/5 sections have 8 interruptions (row 12: 5s become 8s wrongly, similar to Train 1 bleed).
 * Does not match puzzle rules: thicknesses seem off (e.g., 3-group thick? but fills not symmetric), center bar absent or thin 2s in row 20, and backfill likely wrong (zeros to 3? causing extras). Without expected, it fails patterns from trains (no clean nesting).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:34:49] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve extracting a sequence of colors from the first column of an input grid and using run-length encoding of consecutive identical colors to construct a larger square grid (size 2*n - 2, where n is the sequence length) by drawing concentric perimeters or frames with thicknesses equal to the run lengths, starting from the outside and shrinking inward, with possible special handling for the innermost region such as a center bar or full fill using the last color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The output grid is always square with side length 2*n - 2, initialized to 0s, and built by progressively adding layers (perimeters) based on runs of colors in the extracted sequence, shrinking the current frame size by 2*t after each layer where t is the run length.
 * Perimeter drawing must cover top and bottom rows fully for the thickness t, and left/right columns fully for the height of the current frame, but overlaps or corners must be handled carefully to avoid overwriting inner layers prematurely; the code's set_perimeter seems to draw full strips but may overdraw or misalign in inner regions.
 * For inner layers, the perimeter should not bleed into previous outer layers; expected outputs show clean separation, e.g., in training 1, outer 8s are solid without intrusions from inner 2s.
 * The innermost region after all perimeters may require a horizontal center bar or full fill with the last color, but the code's set_center_bar draws a wide horizontal strip across the entire grid (not just the inner area), using seq[-1], which causes it to overwrite outer layers incorrectly (e.g., placing inner colors like 2s in the top rows of training 1 where 8s are expected).
 * Run-length processing must skip or handle zero-thickness correctly, and the loop stops when current_size <=0, but in cases with uneven runs, it may leave unfilled areas or misalign the center.
 * Subtle element: In expected outputs, inner structures like the 6-band in training 1 span fully horizontally within their layer without gaps or partial overwrites, and vertical alignments (e.g., 1s centered) suggest precise column targeting rather than full strips; the code's set_perimeter uses full row/column fills which can cause horizontal bleeding.
 * Another subtlety: In training 2, expected shows symmetric vertical bands (e.g., 3s on sides shrinking inward) and centered inner elements (e.g., 1s as a horizontal bar with 2s around), but generated has asymmetric or misaligned 8s and repeated 1s in wrong positions, indicating failure to handle side perimeters correctly without affecting the center.
 * Across attempts, the extraction of seq from first column works (assuming input is valid), but the shrinking logic (current_start += t; current_size -= 2*t) is mostly correct for outer layers but fails for mid-layers where t varies, leading to negative sizes or skipped fills.
 * The center bar is applied globally (from 0 to s), which is a key miss— it should be confined to the final inner rectangle; also, cross_width=2 may be arbitrary and not match varying inner sizes.
 * General consideration: Outputs must match exactly, including no leftover 0s and precise boundaries; generated often leaves 0s unfilled or overwrites with wrong colors.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The run-length extraction and perimeter shrinking logic (current_start += t; current_size -= 2*t) works for initial outer layers, correctly placing thick borders like the 8s in training 1's sides and the 2-band in the middle.
 * set_perimeter correctly handles vertical columns via set_column, which avoids index errors, but fails on horizontal fills by drawing full current_size strips that bleed into adjacent layers (e.g., in training 1, inner 2s appear in top rows positions 12-13 where expected all 8s).
 * In training 1, the 2-band (rows 2-6 and 18-23) is mostly correct in height and position, but widths are inconsistent (generated has gaps/misaligns at edges), and inner 6/1 regions have partial 8s and 2s where expected solid 6s or 1s.
 * Training 1 generated has duplicated rows (e.g., rows 8-17 repeat patterns incorrectly, with 1s only in partial spots like cols 10-11,13-14 instead of full centered 1s), missing the expected full horizontal spans for inner colors.
 * set_center_bar is unhelpful and broken: in training 1, it draws a wide bar of last color (likely 8 or 2) across the entire grid height, overwriting perimeters (e.g., inserts 2s in top rows cols 12-13); in training 2, it exacerbates misalignment by filling wrong inner areas.
 * In training 2, outer 2s and 3-bands are partially placed (e.g., side 3s in cols 1-2), but 8s appear erroneously in mid-cols (12-13) where expected 3s or 2s, and inner 1s are repeated vertically in wrong positions (rows 6-17 have scattered 1s instead of a single centered horizontal bar).
 * Training 2 generated mismatches expected symmetry: e.g., row 11 has 8s in cols 11-14 where expected 2s, and bottom 3-band is incomplete with extra 2s; unknown reason for the persistent 8s in central cols, possibly from perimeter overdraw.
 * Overall, the program understands concentric layering but misses precise inner boundary enforcement and center handling; extract_colors is helpful and correct, but set_perimeter and set_center_bar need fixes to respect layer isolation.
 * No successful training passes; attempts show partial outer structure but fail inners due to global overwrites.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it follows the same flawed pattern as trainings, with outer 3s in top/bottom rows but intrusions (e.g., 8s in row 2 cols 2-25 where expected likely solid 3s or clean perimeter), indicating perimeter bleeding.
 * Inner layers show misalignments: e.g., row 5 has 8s mostly but 2s in cols 5-11 and 14-20, which doesn't match expected clean bands (likely full 8-band then inner 2s); the 2s in sides (cols 5 and 21) suggest partial vertical perimeters, but horizontal fills are gapped.
 * Central regions have scattered colors like 3s and 7s in row 9 cols 8-9 and 15-18, but then 5s only in specific spots (row 11 cols 11 and 15), which looks asymmetric and incomplete compared to expected centered/full fills (e.g., training patterns suggest solid horizontal 7-band and centered 5-bar).
 * Bottom mirrors top issues, with duplicated rows (e.g., rows 20-21 repeat 2s in middle) and unfilled or wrong 8s; overall, it lacks the symmetry and full spans seen in expected trainings, likely due to the same center_bar global overwrite and perimeter overdraw.
 * The test output makes partial sense for outer 3/8 layers but fails inners, confirming the program's core issue with layer isolation; without expected test, it's hard to pinpoint exact mismatches, but it doesn't align with training expectations of clean, non-overlapping bands.

[2025-10-02 04:34:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve extracting a sequence of colors from the first column of an input grid and using run-length encoding of consecutive identical colors to construct a larger square grid (size 2*n - 2, where n is the sequence length) by drawing concentric perimeters or frames with thicknesses equal to the run lengths, starting from the outside and shrinking inward, with possible special handling for the innermost region such as a center bar or full fill using the last color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The output grid is always square with side length 2*n - 2, initialized to 0s, and built by progressively adding layers (perimeters) based on runs of colors in the extracted sequence, shrinking the current frame size by 2*t after each layer where t is the run length.
 * Perimeter drawing must cover top and bottom rows fully for the thickness t, and left/right columns fully for the height of the current frame, but overlaps or corners must be handled carefully to avoid overwriting inner layers prematurely; the code's set_perimeter seems to draw full strips but may overdraw or misalign in inner regions.
 * For inner layers, the perimeter should not bleed into previous outer layers; expected outputs show clean separation, e.g., in training 1, outer 8s are solid without intrusions from inner 2s.
 * The innermost region after all perimeters may require a horizontal center bar or full fill with the last color, but the code's set_center_bar draws a wide horizontal strip across the entire grid (not just the inner area), using seq[-1], which causes it to overwrite outer layers incorrectly (e.g., placing inner colors like 2s in the top rows of training 1 where 8s are expected).
 * Run-length processing must skip or handle zero-thickness correctly, and the loop stops when current_size <=0, but in cases with uneven runs, it may leave unfilled areas or misalign the center.
 * Subtle element: In expected outputs, inner structures like the 6-band in training 1 span fully horizontally within their layer without gaps or partial overwrites, and vertical alignments (e.g., 1s centered) suggest precise column targeting rather than full strips; the code's set_perimeter uses full row/column fills which can cause horizontal bleeding.
 * Another subtlety: In training 2, expected shows symmetric vertical bands (e.g., 3s on sides shrinking inward) and centered inner elements (e.g., 1s as a horizontal bar with 2s around), but generated has asymmetric or misaligned 8s and repeated 1s in wrong positions, indicating failure to handle side perimeters correctly without affecting the center.
 * Across attempts, the extraction of seq from first column works (assuming input is valid), but the shrinking logic (current_start += t; current_size -= 2*t) is mostly correct for outer layers but fails for mid-layers where t varies, leading to negative sizes or skipped fills.
 * The center bar is applied globally (from 0 to s), which is a key miss— it should be confined to the final inner rectangle; also, cross_width=2 may be arbitrary and not match varying inner sizes.
 * General consideration: Outputs must match exactly, including no leftover 0s and precise boundaries; generated often leaves 0s unfilled or overwrites with wrong colors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle where the input is a grid of colored cells (integers representing colors), and the goal is to generate a larger, symmetric output grid that embeds and transforms the input's row-based color blocks into a framed, nested, and mirrored structure, often with borders, pivots, and recursive sub-patterns that expand or contract widths while maintaining symmetry.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grid's rows have dominant colors; extract these as "row_colors" by taking the first cell of each row, assuming uniform or representative colors per row.
 * Identify horizontal blocks of consecutive same colors in row_colors to detect structures like top/bottom borders (e.g., height 2, color 8) or symmetric layers.
 * Output must be perfectly symmetric vertically and horizontally within layers, with mirroring of upper sections and sub-blocks; failures often occur in asymmetric placements or incorrect width calculations for centers/flanks.
 * Handle borders by adding fixed-width frames (e.g., width 2, color 8) around inner content, reducing effective columns accordingly; without borders, no framing.
 * Use a "pivot" block (first height-1 block) to split the structure into upper (pre-pivot, expanding flanks), side (pivot with nested sub-blocks), and mirrored lower sections.
 * Sub-blocks after pivot require recursive nesting: start with full-width sub-row, then iteratively insert new segments by shrinking center width (subtract 2*previous height), adding symmetric flanks of old color/height, ensuring even widths and minimum center of 2 if negative.
 * Mirroring sub-blocks: reverse the sub-blocks list, but adjust for borders (full reverse) vs. no borders (exclude last if needed); repeat rows per block height.
 * Width calculations are critical: total width is often 2 * effective_cols (+ border adjustments); centers = 2*(eff_cols - flank_width - deltas); extra +1 for borders in pivot.
 * Symmetry breaks easily in flanks (built from prior blocks) or sub-configs (flattening segments); ensure reversed flanks match exactly.
 * For non-bordered cases, skip border logic but maintain pivot/side/mirror; inputs may have varying heights/widths, so compute dynamically.
 * Subtle: In sub-nesting, when updating segments, replace only the center segment with left_flank + new + right_flank; track heights for repetition.
 * In pivot side, add pivot-colored sides of width = pivot_height around sub-content.
 * Outer flanks for side include all pre-pivot blocks + border extra if applicable.
 * Easy to miss: Minimum widths (e.g., new_width=2 if <=0), even flank splits ((old_width - new_width)//2), and handling empty sub_blocks (no side content).
 * Outputs must match exact cell values; small shifts in 1's, 2's, or 6's/8's indicate width miscalculations or wrong pivot selection.

    blocks = []
    i = 0
    n = len(row_colors)
    while i < n:

        j = i + 1
        while j < n and row_colors[j] == c:
            j += 1
        h = j - i
        blocks.append((h, c))
        i = j
    return blocks  # Essential for identifying layers like borders or pivots.
```

    if border_w > 0:
        return [border_c] * border_w + inner + [border_c] * border_w
    return inner  # Useful for framing rows; apply per row in output construction.
```

def flatten_segments(segments: List[tuple]) -> List[int]:
    flat = []
    for ww, cc, _ in segments:
        flat += [cc] * ww
    return flat  # Helpful for building sub-rows from nested (width, color, height) segments.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program correctly detects borders (e.g., top 2 rows of 8's in train 1) and adds framing, producing correct top/bottom 8-rows and initial 2-block rows.
 * Pivot selection (first h=1 block) works partially, building upper sections with expanding flanks and centers of correct color/length in broad strokes.
 * Symmetry in mirroring upper to lower is implemented but fails in sub-sections due to incomplete side mirroring (e.g., train 1 misses extra 1's and shifts 2's in lower half).
 * Sub-nesting logic attempts recursive insertion but errs in segment replacement: in train 1, row 7 has 6's starting too late (positions 8-17 vs. expected 6-19), and inner 1's/2's are asymmetrically placed (e.g., row 10: 1's at 11-14 vs. expected 10-15; row 12: extra 2's at 12-13 but missing width).
 * In train 1, side section has incorrect sub-available width or flank additions, leading to 8's intruding into 1/2 areas (e.g., row 9: 8's at 9-16 vs. expected all 8's but shifted 1's); unknown why pivot extra=1 causes over-narrowing.
 * Train 2 (no border) correctly builds basic 3/2 layers but fails in side: extra rows of 1's (e.g., rows 14-16 have 1's where expected 2's), and misplaced 8's in row 11-12 (should be 2's per expected).
 * Mirroring in train 2 repeats side incorrectly (e.g., lines 14-16 duplicate upper patterns instead of proper reverse sub-blocks), and bottom 3's are mismatched in count/position.
 * Function get_blocks is helpful and correct for layer detection.
 * add_border works for bordered cases but unneeded (correctly skipped) in train 2.
 * flatten_segments is useful but buggy in iterative updates: doesn't preserve total width, causing shrinks (e.g., train 1 sub-row widths drop below expected).
 * The pivot_h used for side_width=pivot_h is correct conceptually but leads to over-narrowing in sub_available = pivot_center_len - 2*side_width.
 * Overall, core structure (upper + side + mirror) is grasped, but width deltas/extras and segment iteration are off, causing all mismatches.
 * No types defined beyond List; could add Tuple[int, int] for blocks.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output partially makes sense structurally (symmetric top/bottom 3's as apparent border/non-border, 8's as inner frame, nested 2/3/7/5 patterns), but does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules inferred from trainings.
 * It correctly frames with 3's (width 2?) and inner 8's (expanding from row 2), with a pivot-like 2-block (rows 5-6,20-21) and sub-nesting (3's then 7's with inner 5's/8's), but asymmetries appear: e.g., row 8 has 3's at 8-9 and 16-17 but expected symmetry might require even placement; row 12 has 5's only at 10-11 (narrow, possibly wrong shrink); row 13-14 insert 8's in 7's center incorrectly (should be sub-color or empty?).
 * Differences from expected (inferred): Likely too many repetitions of inner patterns (e.g., rows 9-10,12-13,15-16 duplicate without height-based variation); 5's appear but may be misplaced (trainings suggest 1/2 infills, not 5); bottom mirroring incomplete (rows 22-25 revert to 8's too early, missing sub-mirror). Widths seem consistent (22 cols), but center calculations off, causing 8's to "leak" into subs (e.g., row 7: 8's at 6-7 and 16-17 vs. pure 2's expected).
 * To handle test: Ensure sub-nesting accounts for new colors (3,7,5) by generalizing blocks; fix mirroring to include full reverse without extras; verify pivot_center_len subtracts correctly for non-8 borders.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input is a grid, and the key sequence is extracted from its first column as a list of colors (representing layers from outer to inner). The output is a larger square grid (size 2*len(sequence)-2) constructed by filling concentric perimeters/borders with groups of consecutive colors from the sequence, handling thicknesses based on group sizes, inner fills with subsequent colors, and a final center bar, with any unfilled areas defaulting to a background color.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The sequence c is groups of consecutive identical colors; each group's count determines the "thickness" t of the border layer (e.g., t=2 means 2 rows/columns thick).
 * Borders are set as perimeters: top and bottom rows filled across the inner width (excluding corners if needed), left and right columns filled vertically across the full height of the current layer, but with offsets to avoid overwriting previous layers (e.g., start after outer layers).
 * Inner areas after the first layer are filled with the next color's group as a solid rectangle, but only after processing the first group; this creates nested frames.
 * For the innermost (last) group, use a horizontal center bar instead of a full perimeter.
 * Grid size s = 2*h - 2 where h=len(c); layers shrink inward by 2*t each time (top+bottom or left+right).
 * Unfilled cells (0s) are backfilled with the first inner color (after the outermost) or fallback to c[0].
 * Subtle: Perimeter filling skips the outermost corners for inner layers to maintain clean borders; left/right sides start/end at current_start +1 to end-1 for tops/bottoms.
 * Easy to miss: Alignment issues cause outer colors to bleed into inner areas (e.g., sides not properly offset); center bar width is min(2, size) or full if small; no diagonal or non-rectangular fills.
 * Group processing is sequential (i increments through c), updating current_start and shrinking current_size after each layer.
 * If h=1, likely full grid of that color; handle empty or zero-size layers by skipping.
 * Background fill only at end, but avoid overwriting valid fills.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; both training examples failed due to misalignment in perimeter setting (e.g., in Train 1, outer sides are 2 instead of 8, inner 6/1 sections have extra 8s bleeding in, and top/bottom borders incomplete; in Train 2, outer frame is 3 but inner fills wrong with misplaced 2s and 8s not matching expected 2 outer).
 * Missed proper inner rectangle fill after first group: code attempts it but uses next_col incorrectly (fills with upcoming color too early/wrong bounds, causing overlaps like 8s in 6 areas in Train 1).
 * Perimeter function broken: left/right j-ranges too narrow (e.g., left_end_j = current_start + t limits vertical sides to only t columns instead of full height, leading to unfilled side areas backfilled wrongly).
 * Group counting correct (while loop for consecutive), but shrinking current_size -=2*t assumes symmetric borders, which works in concept but fails with offsets.
 * Center bar applied only for last group (good), but in Train 1, no clear center bar visible in generated (possibly overwritten).
 * Background fill with c[first_t] (after first layer) is a good idea but over-applies to valid areas (e.g., fills inner 2s with wrong color in Train 1).
 * extract_colors is correct and helpful; set_column is solid for verticals; set_perimeter and set_center_bar are partially helpful but buggy (avoid direct reuse without fixes for ranges).
 * Train 1 generated has symmetric but wrong side colors (2 on left/right where 8 expected), and mismatched inner blob (1s not centered properly, extra 2s); unknown why 1s have 2s interrupting in rows 12-13.
 * Train 2 generated has inverted outer (3 where 2 expected), and inner 8s appear erroneously in center (not in expected); fill after first group places 3s wrongly.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it has an outer frame of 3s with 8s on sides/corners mismatched (e.g., top rows all 3 but sides 8, unlike Train 1 expected where outer is uniform 8), and inner layers show 2s then 3s/7s/5s with 8 bleeds, suggesting sequence like [8,3,2,3,7,5?] but perimeters not concentric properly (e.g., row 5 has 2s only in middle but sides 8/3 mixed).
 * Missing uniform outer border (expected likely full 8 outer like Train 1, but generated mixes 8/3); inner 7/5 sections have 8 interruptions (row 12: 5s become 8s wrongly, similar to Train 1 bleed).
 * Does not match puzzle rules: thicknesses seem off (e.g., 3-group thick? but fills not symmetric), center bar absent or thin 2s in row 20, and backfill likely wrong (zeros to 3? causing extras). Without expected, it fails patterns from trains (no clean nesting).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar

 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 04:42:19] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that transforms an input grid into an output square grid by extracting a vertical color sequence from the input's first column, identifying runs of consecutive identical colors (where run length determines layer thickness), and filling concentric square perimeters (frames/annuli) in the output grid of size 2*n-2 (n = sequence length) with each run's color, starting from the outermost layer and shrinking inward by twice the thickness each time.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The output grid starts empty (all 0s); each layer fills only the perimeter/annulus of the current square region: full horizontal strips for the top t rows and bottom t rows (across the current width), and full vertical strips for the left t columns and right t columns (across the current height), which covers the "arms" of the frame solidly but leaves the strict interior rectangle (center of middle rows) unfilled for subsequent layers to handle.
 * Subtlety: For thick layers (t large relative to current_size), top/bottom fills may cover what would otherwise be "middle" rows, solidly filling more area; for thin layers (e.g., t=1 with large current_size), only the four sides are filled, leaving a large empty cross-shaped interior in middle rows, which must be filled by later inner layers' fills (e.g., an inner layer's top fill can cover a previous layer's empty center).
 * Key: If the sum of all 2*t equals the grid size s, the entire grid gets covered with no 0s left (common in valid inputs); if not, center may remain 0, but training/test seem to cover fully. Overlaps are handled by later fills overwriting earlier empties (but not outer layers, as inner fills stay inner).
 * Easy to miss: The sequence is strictly the first column (row[0] for each row); runs are maximal consecutive same-color groups; grid size is exactly 2*n-2 (e.g., n=14 -> s=26); negative/zero size or t stops filling without error. No diagonal or other fills—strictly axis-aligned perimeters. Inner layers must not bleed outside their current_start/end bounds. Empty grid if n=0.
 * Considerations across attempts: Only one attempt shown, but general: Ensure fill functions clip to grid bounds (0 to s-1); later layers overwrite only their inner area (good for nesting). If test had 0s, it would indicate incomplete coverage, but here none. Unhelpful if code filled entire annuli solidly including centers prematurely (would overwrite inner colors wrongly). Watch for symmetry: output should be symmetric if sequence allows, but irregular thicknesses create asymmetric nesting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def extract_sequence(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    """Extracts the color sequence from the first column of the input grid."""
    return [row[0] for row in g]
```
(This is essential and correct: pulls the vertical sequence accurately; no alternatives needed.)

```python
def create_grid(s: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Creates an empty square grid of size s x s initialized to 0."""
    return [[0 for _ in range(s)] for _ in range(s)]
```
(Basic but helpful for initialization; ensures 0s for unfilled areas.)

```python
def fill_row_segment(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, start_j: int, end_j: int, col: int) -> None:
    """Fills a horizontal segment of a row with the given color."""
    s = len(grid)
    for j in range(max(0, start_j), min(s, end_j + 1)):
        grid[r][j] = col

def fill_column_segment(grid: List[List[int]], j: int, start_r: int, end_r: int, col: int) -> None:
    """Fills a vertical segment of a column with the given color."""
    s = len(grid)
    for r in range(max(0, start_r), min(s, end_r + 1)):
        grid[r][j] = col
```
(These low-level helpers are correct and prevent out-of-bounds; clip to grid edges. Essential for precise segment fills without side effects.)

```python
def fill_layer_perimeter(grid: List[List[int]], current_start: int, t: int, current_size: int, col: int) -> None:
    """Fills the full perimeter of thickness t for the current layer with the color."""
    if current_size <= 0 or t <= 0:
        return
    # Calls the sub-fills: top, bottom, left, right as described.
    # (Full implementation as in attempt; correctly implements annulus perimeter without filling inner center.)
```
(This is the core helpful function: modularly fills one layer's frame correctly. Sub-functions like fill_top_perimeter etc. are supportive but derivable from the segments; keep for clarity.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only attempt detailed; it correctly passed both training examples by accurately extracting runs and filling perimeters without overwriting outer layers or leaving unintended empties in training cases (likely because training sequences covered the grid fully via layer thicknesses).
 * What worked: Run detection via while loop is precise (groups consecutive same colors, t = j - i); grid sizing 2*n-2 fits the concentric shrinking; perimeter fills clip correctly and build nested frames without bleed; handles t=0 or small size gracefully; produced symmetric, color-bounded layers in training.
 * What didn't work: None apparent in training, but if test expected solid full-rectangle fills per layer (overwriting inners), this would leave temporary 0s (though test output shows no 0s, suggesting coverage). No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant; no broken ones (e.g., no irrelevant object extraction, as this puzzle is sequence-to-frame, not object detection). If future attempts add solid interior fills to layers, it would incorrectly fill inner areas too early, mismatching nesting (e.g., would turn frames into solid blocks, losing inner colors).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (26x26 grid) looks correct and makes sense: it depicts nested concentric frames with outer thickness ~2 of 3's (full top/bottom strips, side arms), next ~3 of 8's (covering rows 2-4/21-23 full middle, sides extending), then thin (t=1?) side arms of 2's (e.g., isolated 2's in cols ~5 and ~20 for middle rows like 5-20), with subsequent layers filling previous empties (e.g., inner 8's in row6 cols6-19 as top of next 8 layer; inner 3's block in row8 cols~8-17; 7's frame with inner 5's rectangle in rows~9-16 cols~9-17, and small 8 intrusions). No 0s visible—all areas covered by some perimeter fill, matching how thin layers leave centers for later thick-ish layers to fill via their top/bottom/sides. Differences from naive expectation: Not fully solid blocks (has hollow-ish thin layers filled later), but that's correct per rules; if expected had full solid annuli including forced center fills per layer, this would differ (e.g., row6 center would be 2's not 8's), but output aligns with perimeter-only filling + nesting. Overall, it demonstrates core understanding—no arbitrary shapes, all axis-aligned frames; looks like valid output for a test sequence with runs like multiple 3's, 8's, 2's, 3's, 7's, 5's, etc.
