=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 22:46:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

Test input result: ERROR - Execution error: name 'draw_type_c' is not defined
    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:05:48] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

[2025-09-30 23:05:48] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:11:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

[2025-09-30 23:11:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:17:24] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 23:17:38] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interconnections between properties or components. These are limited to patterns that appear identically across **every** train puzzle (1-4), without speculation, forcing non-existent links, or attempting to explain/derive a full transformation rule. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background, overall symmetry as a high-level trait, or one-off positions) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., blues, pinks, or greens, which do not appear or interact the same way in every puzzle) are excluded. Where a potential connection cannot be traced consistently (e.g., exact cause-effect for positions or sizes), it is noted as unknown rather than explained.

- **Color (Yellow) ↔ Holes (>0)**:  
  In every input and output, any component with holes > 0 is always colored Yellow, and every Yellow component has holes > 0. This holds across all puzzles, including the single instance in train input 3 and all outputs. No other colors have holes > 0 in any example.

- **Color (Yellow) ↔ Bounding Box (square shape)**:  
  In every output, all Yellow components have a square bounding box (width = height, e.g., 4 units in trains 1-3 and most of 4; 8 units for larger ones in train 4). No non-Yellow components have square bounding boxes larger than 2x2. This does not appear in inputs except the one Yellow in train 3 (which is square).

- **Pixels (input singles, pixels=1, holes=0) ↔ Output Yellow placement (starting position)**:  
  In every puzzle, the minimum coordinates (minx, miny) of each output Yellow component's bounding box exactly match the position of at least one input single-pixel component (pixels=1, holes=0) at that same (x,y). This occurs for all Yellows in all outputs (e.g., train 1: [8,1] input matches Yellow [8,1,...]; train 3: [6,0] input matches Yellow [6,0,...]; train 4: [8,4] input matches Yellow [8,4,...]). The specific input color triggering this is unknown (varies: Red in most, but Green in train 4 for one case).

- **Input components (any, with position) ↔ Output Yellow size/transformation (expansion direction)**:  
  In every puzzle, output Yellow components expand from their starting position (as above) consistently rightward and downward (maxx > minx, maxy > miny; no left/upward expansion). The exact size increase or pixel count derivation is unknown (varies: +3 units for 4x4 in trains 1-3 and some of 4; larger merged in train 4).

No other consistent interconnections (e.g., between specific non-Yellow colors, hole count and pixels, or non-Yellow shapes) can be identified across all examples without inconsistency or forcing unrelated elements. Transformations for non-Yellow outputs (e.g., blues, pinks, dark reds) are not consistent across every puzzle (absent in train 3) and are thus unknown.

[2025-09-30 23:19:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all provided train examples (inputs and outputs), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interconnections between properties or components. These are limited to patterns that appear identically across **every** train puzzle (1-4), without speculation, forcing non-existent links, or attempting to explain/derive a full transformation rule. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., background, overall symmetry as a high-level trait, or one-off positions) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., blues, pinks, or greens, which do not appear or interact the same way in every puzzle) are excluded. Where a potential connection cannot be traced consistently (e.g., exact cause-effect for positions or sizes), it is noted as unknown rather than explained.

- **Color (Yellow) ↔ Holes (>0)**:  
  In every input and output, any component with holes > 0 is always colored Yellow, and every Yellow component has holes > 0. This holds across all puzzles, including the single instance in train input 3 and all outputs. No other colors have holes > 0 in any example.

- **Color (Yellow) ↔ Bounding Box (square shape)**:  
  In every output, all Yellow components have a square bounding box (width = height, e.g., 4 units in trains 1-3 and most of 4; 8 units for larger ones in train 4). No non-Yellow components have square bounding boxes larger than 2x2. This does not appear in inputs except the one Yellow in train 3 (which is square).

- **Pixels (input singles, pixels=1, holes=0) ↔ Output Yellow placement (starting position)**:  
  In every puzzle, the minimum coordinates (minx, miny) of each output Yellow component's bounding box exactly match the position of at least one input single-pixel component (pixels=1, holes=0) at that same (x,y). This occurs for all Yellows in all outputs (e.g., train 1: [8,1] input matches Yellow [8,1,...]; train 3: [6,0] input matches Yellow [6,0,...]; train 4: [8,4] input matches Yellow [8,4,...]). The specific input color triggering this is unknown (varies: Red in most, but Green in train 4 for one case).

- **Input components (any, with position) ↔ Output Yellow size/transformation (expansion direction)**:  
  In every puzzle, output Yellow components expand from their starting position (as above) consistently rightward and downward (maxx > minx, maxy > miny; no left/upward expansion). The exact size increase or pixel count derivation is unknown (varies: +3 units for 4x4 in trains 1-3 and some of 4; larger merged in train 4).

No other consistent interconnections (e.g., between specific non-Yellow colors, hole count and pixels, or non-Yellow shapes) can be identified across all examples without inconsistency or forcing unrelated elements. Transformations for non-Yellow outputs (e.g., blues, pinks, dark reds) are not consistent across every puzzle (absent in train 3) and are thus unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:23:13] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

[2025-09-30 23:23:34] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

Based on analysis of the provided training examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact (e.g., one affects the position, color, shape, or presence of another) and appear in **every** training pair (1 through 4). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., greens, oranges, or maroons that do not consistently trigger the same effect across all examples) are excluded. Non-consistent interactions (e.g., those varying by context or only in some examples) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level interpretation or full puzzle solution is attempted.

1. **Red single-pixel position → Yellow frame position, size, and shape properties**:
   - Input: Single-pixel red components (color=red, holes=0, pixels=1, bbox=[x,y,x,y]).
   - Output: Yellow frame components (color=yellow, holes=1, pixels=12, bbox=[x,y,x+3,y+3]).
   - Interaction: The exact position (x,y) of the input red directly determines the top-left corner of the output yellow frame's bbox, with fixed extension (+3 in both x and y directions), holes=1 (indicating a central void), and pixels=12 (indicating a consistent sparse/filled structure, likely a bordered square). This transformation occurs consistently for non-overlapping or edge-positioned reds across all training examples.
   - Consistency: Observed in every training pair for applicable reds (e.g., train 1: 4 instances; train 2: 2 instances; train 3: 3 instances; train 4: 3 small-frame instances matching reds at [8,4], [12,8], [8,12]). Reds in overlapping/central positions (e.g., train 3 [4,4]) show no such transformation, but do not contradict the positional link when it applies.
   - Unknown: Why some reds (e.g., central ones) do not trigger this; no consistent alternative effect observed across all examples.

2. **Adjacent input red positions → Larger yellow frame properties (scale and hole count)**:
   - Input: Multiple single-pixel red components (color=red, holes=0, pixels=1) positioned adjacently in the same row (e.g., spaced 4 units apart horizontally).
   - Output: Larger yellow frame components (color=yellow, holes=3, pixels=36, bbox spanning 8x8 units, e.g., [x,y,x+7,y+7]).
   - Interaction: Horizontal adjacency of reds causes a scaled-up yellow frame where the starting position (x,y) of the leftmost red sets the top-left bbox corner, with doubled size (+7 extension), tripled holes (holes=3), and tripled pixels (36=3×12), suggesting a merged or nested structure from the small-frame interaction above. The original small-frame properties (holes=1, pixels=12) are embedded or expanded.
   - Consistency: This build-on occurs in every training pair where horizontal red adjacency exists (e.g., train 4: reds at [0,0] and [4,0] → [0,0-7,7]; a similar pattern at bottom for [12,16] and [16,16] → [12,12-19,19], though starting y=12 lacks a direct red but aligns with the group). No adjacency in trains 1-3, so defaults to small frames; no contradictions.
   - Unknown: Exact adjacency threshold (e.g., must be exactly 4 units?); why bottom large frame in train 4 starts at y=12 without a red there (possibly influenced by nearby non-reds like green at [12,12], but inconsistent across examples); vertical adjacency effects (none observed consistently).

No other interactions (e.g., involving blue, pink, green, orange, maroon, or dark red components) are consistent across **every** training example, as their transformations vary by position, color adjacency, or presence (e.g., blues appear as 2-pixel lines in outputs 1,2,4 but not 3; pinks as 2x2 squares in outputs 1,4 but not 2,3; dark reds only in 4). Grid structure (implicit matrix layout) enables positional interactions but does not itself transform. Pre-existing yellow frames in inputs (e.g., train 3) show no consistent interaction with outputs beyond potential overlap avoidance (unknown rule).

[2025-09-30 23:24:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided training examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions and connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact (e.g., one affects the position, color, shape, or presence of another) and appear in **every** training pair (1 through 4). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., greens, oranges, or maroons that do not consistently trigger the same effect across all examples) are excluded. Non-consistent interactions (e.g., those varying by context or only in some examples) are noted as unknown where applicable. No high-level interpretation or full puzzle solution is attempted.

1. **Red single-pixel position → Yellow frame position, size, and shape properties**:
   - Input: Single-pixel red components (color=red, holes=0, pixels=1, bbox=[x,y,x,y]).
   - Output: Yellow frame components (color=yellow, holes=1, pixels=12, bbox=[x,y,x+3,y+3]).
   - Interaction: The exact position (x,y) of the input red directly determines the top-left corner of the output yellow frame's bbox, with fixed extension (+3 in both x and y directions), holes=1 (indicating a central void), and pixels=12 (indicating a consistent sparse/filled structure, likely a bordered square). This transformation occurs consistently for non-overlapping or edge-positioned reds across all training examples.
   - Consistency: Observed in every training pair for applicable reds (e.g., train 1: 4 instances; train 2: 2 instances; train 3: 3 instances; train 4: 3 small-frame instances matching reds at [8,4], [12,8], [8,12]). Reds in overlapping/central positions (e.g., train 3 [4,4]) show no such transformation, but do not contradict the positional link when it applies.
   - Unknown: Why some reds (e.g., central ones) do not trigger this; no consistent alternative effect observed across all examples.

2. **Adjacent input red positions → Larger yellow frame properties (scale and hole count)**:
   - Input: Multiple single-pixel red components (color=red, holes=0, pixels=1) positioned adjacently in the same row (e.g., spaced 4 units apart horizontally).
   - Output: Larger yellow frame components (color=yellow, holes=3, pixels=36, bbox spanning 8x8 units, e.g., [x,y,x+7,y+7]).
   - Interaction: Horizontal adjacency of reds causes a scaled-up yellow frame where the starting position (x,y) of the leftmost red sets the top-left bbox corner, with doubled size (+7 extension), tripled holes (holes=3), and tripled pixels (36=3×12), suggesting a merged or nested structure from the small-frame interaction above. The original small-frame properties (holes=1, pixels=12) are embedded or expanded.
   - Consistency: This build-on occurs in every training pair where horizontal red adjacency exists (e.g., train 4: reds at [0,0] and [4,0] → [0,0-7,7]; a similar pattern at bottom for [12,16] and [16,16] → [12,12-19,19], though starting y=12 lacks a direct red but aligns with the group). No adjacency in trains 1-3, so defaults to small frames; no contradictions.
   - Unknown: Exact adjacency threshold (e.g., must be exactly 4 units?); why bottom large frame in train 4 starts at y=12 without a red there (possibly influenced by nearby non-reds like green at [12,12], but inconsistent across examples); vertical adjacency effects (none observed consistently).

No other interactions (e.g., involving blue, pink, green, orange, maroon, or dark red components) are consistent across **every** training example, as their transformations vary by position, color adjacency, or presence (e.g., blues appear as 2-pixel lines in outputs 1,2,4 but not 3; pinks as 2x2 squares in outputs 1,4 but not 2,3; dark reds only in 4). Grid structure (implicit matrix layout) enables positional interactions but does not itself transform. Pre-existing yellow frames in inputs (e.g., train 3) show no consistent interaction with outputs beyond potential overlap avoidance (unknown rule).


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:31:04] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

```python
def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.
    # Specific to seed 5; uses half = size//2 for split.
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 23:31:17] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements (shapes, colors, positions, holes, etc.). These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (1-4) where the relevant input elements are present, without forcing unrelated or inconsistent links. Only direct, observable connections are included—e.g., how one property (like input color or position) affects or maps to an output property (like color change, bbox transformation, or shape property). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated pixels with no output counterpart) or inconsistent ones (e.g., interactions that fail in even one example) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., why a connection doesn't apply in specific cases) are explicitly noted without speculation or attempted explanation.

- **Input Red (holes=0, pixels=1) position → Output Yellow (holes=1, pixels=12) bbox starting position**: The (x,y) coordinates of single-pixel Red input shapes consistently determine the top-left starting point of Yellow output shapes with a fixed bbox extension to [x, y, x+3, y+3]. This interaction occurs in every train example with Red inputs (trains 1, 2, 3, 4), producing at least one such Yellow per qualifying Red. Unknown: Why this does not apply to the central Red in train 3 or clustered Reds in train 4 (which instead contribute to larger Yellows).

- **Input Blue (holes=0, pixels=2) shape properties (bbox, position) → Output Blue identical copy**: Existing Blue domino-shaped clusters (pixels=2, no holes) in the input are consistently preserved unchanged in the output, with matching bbox, pixels, and position. This interaction is observed in every train where input Blues are present (train 2); no counterexamples in others (trains 1, 3, 4 have no input Blues).

- **Input Orange (holes=0, pixels=1) position → Output Pink (holes=0, pixels=4) bbox starting position**: The (x,y) coordinates of single-pixel Orange input shapes consistently determine the top-left starting point of Pink output squares with a fixed bbox extension to [x, y, x+1, y+1]. This interaction occurs in every train with Orange inputs (trains 1, 4); trains 2 and 3 lack Oranges and thus no Pinks from this. Unknown: Why this does not apply to the Orange at [5,5] in train 1.

- **Input Green (holes=0, pixels=1) position → Output Blue (holes=0, pixels=2) adjacent placements**: Positions of single-pixel Green input shapes consistently correlate with the appearance of new Blue dominoes (pixels=2, no holes) placed immediately adjacent (sharing an edge) to the Green's position in the output. This interaction is observed in every train with Green inputs (trains 1, 2, 4), adding at least one such Blue per Green; train 3 lacks Greens.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable across all trains (e.g., Maroon/Dark Red links appear only in train 4; input Pink positions do not consistently map to output Pinks; hole counts in inputs do not directly affect output holes except indirectly via Yellows; no consistent color-to-hole or pixel count transformations beyond the above). Larger Yellows (e.g., holes=3, pixels=36 in train 4) suggest cluster-based merging of the Red-Yellow interaction but are unknown in other trains.

[2025-09-30 23:32:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

```python
def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.
    # Specific to seed 5; uses half = size//2 for split.
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements (shapes, colors, positions, holes, etc.). These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (1-4) where the relevant input elements are present, without forcing unrelated or inconsistent links. Only direct, observable connections are included—e.g., how one property (like input color or position) affects or maps to an output property (like color change, bbox transformation, or shape property). Irrelevant elements (e.g., isolated pixels with no output counterpart) or inconsistent ones (e.g., interactions that fail in even one example) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., why a connection doesn't apply in specific cases) are explicitly noted without speculation or attempted explanation.

- **Input Red (holes=0, pixels=1) position → Output Yellow (holes=1, pixels=12) bbox starting position**: The (x,y) coordinates of single-pixel Red input shapes consistently determine the top-left starting point of Yellow output shapes with a fixed bbox extension to [x, y, x+3, y+3]. This interaction occurs in every train example with Red inputs (trains 1, 2, 3, 4), producing at least one such Yellow per qualifying Red. Unknown: Why this does not apply to the central Red in train 3 or clustered Reds in train 4 (which instead contribute to larger Yellows).

- **Input Blue (holes=0, pixels=2) shape properties (bbox, position) → Output Blue identical copy**: Existing Blue domino-shaped clusters (pixels=2, no holes) in the input are consistently preserved unchanged in the output, with matching bbox, pixels, and position. This interaction is observed in every train where input Blues are present (train 2); no counterexamples in others (trains 1, 3, 4 have no input Blues).

- **Input Orange (holes=0, pixels=1) position → Output Pink (holes=0, pixels=4) bbox starting position**: The (x,y) coordinates of single-pixel Orange input shapes consistently determine the top-left starting point of Pink output squares with a fixed bbox extension to [x, y, x+1, y+1]. This interaction occurs in every train with Orange inputs (trains 1, 4); trains 2 and 3 lack Oranges and thus no Pinks from this. Unknown: Why this does not apply to the Orange at [5,5] in train 1.

- **Input Green (holes=0, pixels=1) position → Output Blue (holes=0, pixels=2) adjacent placements**: Positions of single-pixel Green input shapes consistently correlate with the appearance of new Blue dominoes (pixels=2, no holes) placed immediately adjacent (sharing an edge) to the Green's position in the output. This interaction is observed in every train with Green inputs (trains 1, 2, 4), adding at least one such Blue per Green; train 3 lacks Greens.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable across all trains (e.g., Maroon/Dark Red links appear only in train 4; input Pink positions do not consistently map to output Pinks; hole counts in inputs do not directly affect output holes except indirectly via Yellows; no consistent color-to-hole or pixel count transformations beyond the above). Larger Yellows (e.g., holes=3, pixels=36 in train 4) suggest cluster-based merging of the Red-Yellow interaction but are unknown in other trains.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:37:46] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns in a zero-initialized output grid, with mappings to target colors and shapes (e.g., borders, frames, L-steps), while preserving complete pre-existing patterns and avoiding conflicts from overlapping or non-isolated seeds. The goal is to transform scattered or partial seeds into complete, colored patterns without overwriting unintended areas, handling edge cases like grid boundaries and multiple overlapping potential draws.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be isolated: Only draw if exactly one seed of the matching value exists in the 4x4 window and no conflicting non-zero, non-target values are present in the window (excluding the seed position itself).
 * Complete type C patterns (inner frames with corners and full middle-row inners filled with the same value) in the input must be detected and redrawn exactly in the output with their original value to preserve them, before processing individual seeds.
 * Pattern mappings are value-specific: 1/3 map to inner border (type B, color 1, blue); 2 to outer border (type A, color 4, yellow); 5 to L-shaped step (color 6, pink); 7/8 to inner frame (type C, color 7, dark red)—note that 7/8 use the same draw but preserve original if complete.
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size, but clipped at grid edges (rows/columns); drawing only affects valid bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Overlaps and conflicts: If a window has multiple same-value seeds or extraneous non-zeros (not the target color), skip drawing to prevent partial or corrupted patterns.
 * Subtle edge case: Type C detection checks for exact match where corners and inner middles are filled, but sides are empty—missing this leads to over-drawing or under-detection.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), so iterations must respect n/m dimensions; empty rows/columns in input should remain zero in output unless drawn.
 * No drawing for value 0 or unmapped values (e.g., 4,6 not seeds); output starts as all zeros.
 * Potential overlap between patterns: Prioritize complete type C detection first, then seed processing, but seeds might overlap with detected C's—current logic may redraw if not careful.
 * Visual symmetry: Patterns like type A/B are border-like (full top/bottom, sides only), type C is sparse (corners + inner horizontal fills on middle rows), step is asymmetric L.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws full outer border: top/bottom rows full, middle rows only sides. Clips at edges.
    # Useful for seed 2 mapping to yellow (4).
    n = len(grid)
    m = len(grid[0])
    for i in range(size):
        r = start_r + i
        if r >= n: break
        row = grid[r]
        if i == 0 or i == size - 1:
            for j in range(start_c, start_c + size):
                if j < m: row[j] = color
        else:
            if start_c < m: row[start_c] = color
            end_c = start_c + size - 1
            if end_c < m: row[end_c] = color
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Detects complete type C: corners and middle inners filled with v, sides/edges otherwise 0 in 4x4.
    # Essential for preserving full input patterns before seed processing.
    size = 4
    n = len(g); m = len(g[0])
    if r + size > n or c + size > m: return False
    v = g[r][c]
    if v == 0: return False
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            rr, cc = r + i, c + j
            expected = 0
            if i in (0, size-1) and j in (0, size-1): expected = v  # corners
            elif 1 <= i <= size-2 and 1 <= j <= size-2: expected = v  # inner middles
            if g[rr][cc] != expected: return False
    return True
```

```python
# Mapping dictionary for seeds (v_map) and draw dict (draw_dict) from program:
v_map = {1: ('b', 1), 2: ('a', 4), 3: ('b', 1), 5: ('step', 6), 7: ('c', 7), 8: ('c', 7)}
draw_dict = {'a': draw_type_a, 'b': draw_type_b, 'c': draw_type_c, 'step': draw_step}
# Used in main loop for targeted drawing after isolation check.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles all 4 training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of seed isolation, mapping, and basic drawing for types A/B/C/step.
 * Worked: Complete type C detection and redraw preserves input frames accurately; seed processing skips non-isolated or conflicting windows correctly, avoiding overdraws in training.
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): No explicit handling for partial type C seeds (only complete detection), so isolated 7/8 might draw full C even if input is sparse; potential issue if training didn't test overlaps between multiple seed types.
 * Missed: No function to extract or count all objects globally (e.g., no extract_objects helper), relying on per-cell scanning which is fine but inefficient for large grids; could add for debugging.
 * Consider problems where seeds are near edges (r > n-4 or c > m-4 skipped correctly, but partial draws might need adjustment).
 * Function draw_type_b is helpful but subtle: It draws inner borders (top/bottom partial, sides full), differing from type A by excluding corners on top/bottom.
 * Function draw_step is asymmetric (half vertical then horizontal), worked for training but untested in overlaps.
 * Function detect_type_c is essential and correct: Checks exact sparse pattern (corners + inner fills), prevents false positives.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all draws are relevant, though draw_type_a/b/c could be visualized for debugging (e.g., print grids).
 * Train examples all passed, so core logic (isolation count_same==1, no conflict) is solid; no mismatches reported.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows multiple incomplete or partial 4x4 frames of 7's across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 patterns in columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., forming box-like structures at positions like (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), etc., with some disruptions in rows 5-17 like missing inners or shifted 7's).
 * It makes partial sense: Appears to be drawing type C inner frames for multiple 7/8 seeds, with clipping or skipping in lower sections (e.g., rows 9-17 have sparser 7's, like isolated columns), and all-zero top/bottom rows preserved.
 * Does not look fully correct: Several patterns seem incomplete or overlapped incorrectly (e.g., row 5: 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7—extra 7's at col 4/5 don't fit clean type C; row 9 has 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7... suggesting failed isolation or conflict skips). Expected cleaner, non-overlapping full frames if input has isolated 7/8 seeds; differences likely from not handling partial inputs or multi-seed windows in test (e.g., count_same >1 skipped some, but left gaps).
 * Missing: No evidence of other colors (1,4,6) in output, so test input probably only has 7/8 seeds; if input has mixed, this would underdraw. Gaps in middle (e.g., cols 9-15 all 0 in some rows) suggest conflicts or no seeds there, but unclear without input.
 * The output is different from a "perfect" expectation of symmetric, complete 7-frames without extras/gaps; unknown why some areas (e.g., row 14: 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7) have partial side 7's—possibly edge clipping or detection failure.

[2025-09-30 23:37:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

# Similar detect_type_b and detect_type_c are helpful for exact matches, but detect_type_c is missing in code (causes error).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

```python
def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.
    # Specific to seed 5; uses half = size//2 for split.
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

    return True
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns in a zero-initialized output grid, with mappings to target colors and shapes (e.g., borders, frames, L-steps), while preserving complete pre-existing patterns and avoiding conflicts from overlapping or non-isolated seeds. The goal is to transform scattered or partial seeds into complete, colored patterns without overwriting unintended areas, handling edge cases like grid boundaries and multiple overlapping potential draws.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be isolated: Only draw if exactly one seed of the matching value exists in the 4x4 window and no conflicting non-zero, non-target values are present in the window (excluding the seed position itself).
 * Complete type C patterns (inner frames with corners and full middle-row inners filled with the same value) in the input must be detected and redrawn exactly in the output with their original value to preserve them, before processing individual seeds.
 * Pattern mappings are value-specific: 1/3 map to inner border (type B, color 1, blue); 2 to outer border (type A, color 4, yellow); 5 to L-shaped step (color 6, pink); 7/8 to inner frame (type C, color 7, dark red)—note that 7/8 use the same draw but preserve original if complete.
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size, but clipped at grid edges (rows/columns); drawing only affects valid bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Overlaps and conflicts: If a window has multiple same-value seeds or extraneous non-zeros (not the target color), skip drawing to prevent partial or corrupted patterns.
 * Subtle edge case: Type C detection checks for exact match where corners and inner middles are filled, but sides are empty—missing this leads to over-drawing or under-detection.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), so iterations must respect n/m dimensions; empty rows/columns in input should remain zero in output unless drawn.
 * No drawing for value 0 or unmapped values (e.g., 4,6 not seeds); output starts as all zeros.
 * Potential overlap between patterns: Prioritize complete type C detection first, then seed processing, but seeds might overlap with detected C's—current logic may redraw if not careful.
 * Visual symmetry: Patterns like type A/B are border-like (full top/bottom, sides only), type C is sparse (corners + inner horizontal fills on middle rows), step is asymmetric L.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles all 4 training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of seed isolation, mapping, and basic drawing for types A/B/C/step.
 * Worked: Complete type C detection and redraw preserves input frames accurately; seed processing skips non-isolated or conflicting windows correctly, avoiding overdraws in training.
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): No explicit handling for partial type C seeds (only complete detection), so isolated 7/8 might draw full C even if input is sparse; potential issue if training didn't test overlaps between multiple seed types.
 * Missed: No function to extract or count all objects globally (e.g., no extract_objects helper), relying on per-cell scanning which is fine but inefficient for large grids; could add for debugging.
 * Consider problems where seeds are near edges (r > n-4 or c > m-4 skipped correctly, but partial draws might need adjustment).
 * Function draw_type_b is helpful but subtle: It draws inner borders (top/bottom partial, sides full), differing from type A by excluding corners on top/bottom.
 * Function draw_step is asymmetric (half vertical then horizontal), worked for training but untested in overlaps.
 * Function detect_type_c is essential and correct: Checks exact sparse pattern (corners + inner fills), prevents false positives.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all draws are relevant, though draw_type_a/b/c could be visualized for debugging (e.g., print grids).
 * Train examples all passed, so core logic (isolation count_same==1, no conflict) is solid; no mismatches reported.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows multiple incomplete or partial 4x4 frames of 7's across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 patterns in columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., forming box-like structures at positions like (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), etc., with some disruptions in rows 5-17 like missing inners or shifted 7's).
 * It makes partial sense: Appears to be drawing type C inner frames for multiple 7/8 seeds, with clipping or skipping in lower sections (e.g., rows 9-17 have sparser 7's, like isolated columns), and all-zero top/bottom rows preserved.
 * Does not look fully correct: Several patterns seem incomplete or overlapped incorrectly (e.g., row 5: 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7—extra 7's at col 4/5 don't fit clean type C; row 9 has 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7... suggesting failed isolation or conflict skips). Expected cleaner, non-overlapping full frames if input has isolated 7/8 seeds; differences likely from not handling partial inputs or multi-seed windows in test (e.g., count_same >1 skipped some, but left gaps).
 * Missing: No evidence of other colors (1,4,6) in output, so test input probably only has 7/8 seeds; if input has mixed, this would underdraw. Gaps in middle (e.g., cols 9-15 all 0 in some rows) suggest conflicts or no seeds there, but unclear without input.
 * The output is different from a "perfect" expectation of symmetric, complete 7-frames without extras/gaps; unknown why some areas (e.g., row 14: 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7) have partial side 7's—possibly edge clipping or detection failure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:41:49] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) must be transformed into an output grid by detecting and "completing" specific 4x4 shapes (types A, B, C, or step) around those seeds, filling them with a target color while handling isolation, conflicts, and complete patterns to avoid overlaps or partial draws. The rules prioritize drawing full type C patterns if already present in the input, then isolated single seeds, but fixed size=4 and strict checks can miss clustered or partial setups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 4x4: Type A is a full outline square (top/bottom full width, sides left/right); Type B is a hollow square with shortened top/bottom (inner 2 columns only) and full-height sides; Type C is a thin frame (top/bottom only left/right edges, middle rows inner 2 columns); Step is a half-filled L-shape (left half on top 2 rows, right half on bottom 2 rows).
 * Seeds map to types and targets: 1->B with color 1; 2->A with 4; 3->B with 1; 5->Step with 6; 7/8->C with 7 (treated specially for complete detection).
 * Complete type C detection requires the exact frame pattern in the input's 4x4 (non-zeros only at corners on top/bottom and inner 2x2 center on middle rows, all matching the seed value v; everything else 0); if detected for 7/8 seeds, draw the same frame with 7 (no filling, just the frame).
 * Isolated seed drawing only triggers if exactly one seed of value v in the 4x4, and no conflicts (other cells are 0 or target color; other non-zero non-target blocks it); this prevents drawing over clusters but can leave partial or adjacent seeds undrawn.
 * Boundaries: Drawings clip at grid edges (rows/cols beyond n/m skipped); no overlapping resolution—later draws overwrite earlier ones (order is complete C first, then isolated scan top-to-bottom left-to-right).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Clustered seeds (e.g., multiple same v in one 4x4) fail isolation (count_v >1), leading to no draw even if they form a valid larger pattern; conflicts allow same-v or target but block others, potentially allowing partial propagation but not full completion; all shapes use size=4 fixed (no variable sizes); output starts all 0s, so undrawn seeds remain 0 (not copied); no handling for overlapping shapes from adjacent seeds (e.g., shared edges may get partial fills); v=0 or unmapped ignored; complete C only checked for 7/8 and only draws the frame, not a solid fill.
 * General considerations: Input may have partial patterns or clusters needing different detection (e.g., count partial matches or merge adjacent); colors are shape-specific (not all 7); scan order matters for overlaps; empty grid returns empty; training likely had simple isolated/complete cases, but test has complex layouts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws full square outline: useful for type 'a' seeds (v=2, target=4)

        else:
            if start_c < m: row[start_c] = color
            end_c = start_c + size - 1
            if end_c < m: row[end_c] = color

def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws hollow square with inner top/bottom: useful for type 'b' seeds (v=1/3, target=1)
    # Similar structure to draw_type_a but top/bottom range(start_c+1, start_c+size-1)

def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws thin frame: top/bottom only edges, middle inner columns; useful for 'c' (v=7/8, target=7)

def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Checks exact 4x4 frame in input: corners on top/bottom, inner 2 cols on middle rows all == v, rest 0
    # Essential for prioritizing complete C patterns; returns False if out of bounds or v=0
    size = 4
    n = len(g); m = len(g[0])
    if r + size > n or c + size > m: return False
    v = g[r][c]
    if v == 0: return False
    for i in range(size):

            rr, cc = r + i, c + j
            expected = 0
            if i == 0 or i == size - 1:
                if j == 0 or j == size - 1: expected = v
            elif 1 <= i <= size - 2:
                if 1 <= j <= size - 2: expected = v
            if g[rr][cc] != expected: return False
    return True
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly identified and drew complete type C frames and isolated seeds for training examples, passing all 4 by applying v_map, isolation checks (count_v==1, no conflicts), and boundary clipping.
 * Worked well for simple cases: Isolated single seeds trigger full shape draws with target color; complete C detection draws the frame exactly as in input.
 * Did not handle clustered seeds: If multiple seeds (even same v) in a 4x4, isolation fails (count_v >1), leaving them as 0 in output—no partial completion or merging.
 * Strict conflict check blocks draws if any non-zero non-target in 4x4, but allows target or same v (though count_v still blocks multiples); this missed potential propagations in dense areas.
 * Fixed size=4 assumes all shapes 4x4, but may miss larger/variable patterns; no overlap resolution (e.g., adjacent shapes may overwrite inconsistently).
 * Scan order (complete C first, then isolated top-left to bottom-right) worked for training but caused partial overwrites in test clusters.
 * v_map covers key seeds but ignores others (e.g., 4,6?); output doesn't copy input seeds, always starts from 0s.
 * detect_type_c is helpful and accurate for exact frames but too strict—doesn't detect partial C or other types; draw functions are precise but only outline/fill as defined (no solid fills).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding all seeds or clusters); isolation check is basic but unhelpful for non-isolated cases (consider enhancing to count partial matches).
 * Training mismatches none (all correct), but unknown if training had clusters—likely simple isolated/complete only.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly draws multiple adjacent type C frames with 7 in the upper section (rows 1-4, columns 0-19 in 4-col groups: exact thin frame patterns like 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 / 0 7 7 0 / 7 0 0 7), and similar in rows 5-8 (left two and right one groups), suggesting complete C detection or isolated 7/8 seeds triggered draws there.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 9-16) shows incomplete or broken patterns—e.g., row 9 has top edges (7 0 0 7) in cols 0-3, 8-11, 16-19 but zeros in 4-7 and 12-15; rows 10-11 have middle inners (0 7 7 0) only in some groups (0-3, 8-11, 16-19); row 13 has top edges but shifted/merges in cols 12-19 (7 0 0 7 overlapping into next); rows 14-15 have partial middles only in 0-3, 12-15, 16-19 with gaps. This results in asymmetric, gapped shapes (e.g., no full C in cols 4-7 or 8-11 lower, and potential overwrites creating extra 7s in row 13 cols 16-19).
 * Differences from expected: Expected likely symmetric complete frames or filled shapes across the entire patterned area (mirroring upper completeness), but generated has undrawn gaps/misses in middle-lower groups, probably because clustered 7/8 seeds failed isolation (count_v >1 in those 4x4s) and weren't detected as complete C (input may have partial frames there). No step or other types visible (all 7s, so test focuses on C), but incompletes suggest program didn't propagate partials or handle adjacency—e.g., adjacent seeds should perhaps merge into larger C or draw despite count_v>1 if no conflict.
 * Overall, test output captures some frames but leaves partials as 0s or inconsistent, not matching a clean, rule-complete transformation; unknown exact input, but gaps indicate isolation/complete checks too restrictive for test's clustered layout.

[2025-09-30 23:41:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) must be transformed into an output grid by detecting and "completing" specific 4x4 shapes (types A, B, C, or step) around those seeds, filling them with a target color while handling isolation, conflicts, and complete patterns to avoid overlaps or partial draws. The rules prioritize drawing full type C patterns if already present in the input, then isolated single seeds, but fixed size=4 and strict checks can miss clustered or partial setups.

 * Shapes are always 4x4: Type A is a full outline square (top/bottom full width, sides left/right); Type B is a hollow square with shortened top/bottom (inner 2 columns only) and full-height sides; Type C is a thin frame (top/bottom only left/right edges, middle rows inner 2 columns); Step is a half-filled L-shape (left half on top 2 rows, right half on bottom 2 rows).
 * Seeds map to types and targets: 1->B with color 1; 2->A with 4; 3->B with 1; 5->Step with 6; 7/8->C with 7 (treated specially for complete detection).
 * Complete type C detection requires the exact frame pattern in the input's 4x4 (non-zeros only at corners on top/bottom and inner 2x2 center on middle rows, all matching the seed value v; everything else 0); if detected for 7/8 seeds, draw the same frame with 7 (no filling, just the frame).
 * Isolated seed drawing only triggers if exactly one seed of value v in the 4x4, and no conflicts (other cells are 0 or target color; other non-zero non-target blocks it); this prevents drawing over clusters but can leave partial or adjacent seeds undrawn.
 * Boundaries: Drawings clip at grid edges (rows/cols beyond n/m skipped); no overlapping resolution—later draws overwrite earlier ones (order is complete C first, then isolated scan top-to-bottom left-to-right).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Clustered seeds (e.g., multiple same v in one 4x4) fail isolation (count_v >1), leading to no draw even if they form a valid larger pattern; conflicts allow same-v or target but block others, potentially allowing partial propagation but not full completion; all shapes use size=4 fixed (no variable sizes); output starts all 0s, so undrawn seeds remain 0 (not copied); no handling for overlapping shapes from adjacent seeds (e.g., shared edges may get partial fills); v=0 or unmapped ignored; complete C only checked for 7/8 and only draws the frame, not a solid fill.
 * General considerations: Input may have partial patterns or clusters needing different detection (e.g., count partial matches or merge adjacent); colors are shape-specific (not all 7); scan order matters for overlaps; empty grid returns empty; training likely had simple isolated/complete cases, but test has complex layouts.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly identified and drew complete type C frames and isolated seeds for training examples, passing all 4 by applying v_map, isolation checks (count_v==1, no conflicts), and boundary clipping.
 * Worked well for simple cases: Isolated single seeds trigger full shape draws with target color; complete C detection draws the frame exactly as in input.
 * Did not handle clustered seeds: If multiple seeds (even same v) in a 4x4, isolation fails (count_v >1), leaving them as 0 in output—no partial completion or merging.
 * Strict conflict check blocks draws if any non-zero non-target in 4x4, but allows target or same v (though count_v still blocks multiples); this missed potential propagations in dense areas.
 * Fixed size=4 assumes all shapes 4x4, but may miss larger/variable patterns; no overlap resolution (e.g., adjacent shapes may overwrite inconsistently).
 * Scan order (complete C first, then isolated top-left to bottom-right) worked for training but caused partial overwrites in test clusters.
 * v_map covers key seeds but ignores others (e.g., 4,6?); output doesn't copy input seeds, always starts from 0s.
 * detect_type_c is helpful and accurate for exact frames but too strict—doesn't detect partial C or other types; draw functions are precise but only outline/fill as defined (no solid fills).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding all seeds or clusters); isolation check is basic but unhelpful for non-isolated cases (consider enhancing to count partial matches).
 * Training mismatches none (all correct), but unknown if training had clusters—likely simple isolated/complete only.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly draws multiple adjacent type C frames with 7 in the upper section (rows 1-4, columns 0-19 in 4-col groups: exact thin frame patterns like 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 / 0 7 7 0 / 7 0 0 7), and similar in rows 5-8 (left two and right one groups), suggesting complete C detection or isolated 7/8 seeds triggered draws there.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 9-16) shows incomplete or broken patterns—e.g., row 9 has top edges (7 0 0 7) in cols 0-3, 8-11, 16-19 but zeros in 4-7 and 12-15; rows 10-11 have middle inners (0 7 7 0) only in some groups (0-3, 8-11, 16-19); row 13 has top edges but shifted/merges in cols 12-19 (7 0 0 7 overlapping into next); rows 14-15 have partial middles only in 0-3, 12-15, 16-19 with gaps. This results in asymmetric, gapped shapes (e.g., no full C in cols 4-7 or 8-11 lower, and potential overwrites creating extra 7s in row 13 cols 16-19).
 * Differences from expected: Expected likely symmetric complete frames or filled shapes across the entire patterned area (mirroring upper completeness), but generated has undrawn gaps/misses in middle-lower groups, probably because clustered 7/8 seeds failed isolation (count_v >1 in those 4x4s) and weren't detected as complete C (input may have partial frames there). No step or other types visible (all 7s, so test focuses on C), but incompletes suggest program didn't propagate partials or handle adjacency—e.g., adjacent seeds should perhaps merge into larger C or draw despite count_v>1 if no conflict.
 * Overall, test output captures some frames but leaves partials as 0s or inconsistent, not matching a clean, rule-complete transformation; unknown exact input, but gaps indicate isolation/complete checks too restrictive for test's clustered layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.
    # Specific to seed 5; uses half = size//2 for split.
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

    return True

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns in a zero-initialized output grid, with mappings to target colors and shapes (e.g., borders, frames, L-steps), while preserving complete pre-existing patterns and avoiding conflicts from overlapping or non-isolated seeds. The goal is to transform scattered or partial seeds into complete, colored patterns without overwriting unintended areas, handling edge cases like grid boundaries and multiple overlapping potential draws.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be isolated: Only draw if exactly one seed of the matching value exists in the 4x4 window and no conflicting non-zero, non-target values are present in the window (excluding the seed position itself).
 * Complete type C patterns (inner frames with corners and full middle-row inners filled with the same value) in the input must be detected and redrawn exactly in the output with their original value to preserve them, before processing individual seeds.
 * Pattern mappings are value-specific: 1/3 map to inner border (type B, color 1, blue); 2 to outer border (type A, color 4, yellow); 5 to L-shaped step (color 6, pink); 7/8 to inner frame (type C, color 7, dark red)—note that 7/8 use the same draw but preserve original if complete.
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size, but clipped at grid edges (rows/columns); drawing only affects valid bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Overlaps and conflicts: If a window has multiple same-value seeds or extraneous non-zeros (not the target color), skip drawing to prevent partial or corrupted patterns.
 * Subtle edge case: Type C detection checks for exact match where corners and inner middles are filled, but sides are empty—missing this leads to over-drawing or under-detection.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), so iterations must respect n/m dimensions; empty rows/columns in input should remain zero in output unless drawn.
 * No drawing for value 0 or unmapped values (e.g., 4,6 not seeds); output starts as all zeros.
 * Potential overlap between patterns: Prioritize complete type C detection first, then seed processing, but seeds might overlap with detected C's—current logic may redraw if not careful.
 * Visual symmetry: Patterns like type A/B are border-like (full top/bottom, sides only), type C is sparse (corners + inner horizontal fills on middle rows), step is asymmetric L.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles all 4 training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of seed isolation, mapping, and basic drawing for types A/B/C/step.
 * Worked: Complete type C detection and redraw preserves input frames accurately; seed processing skips non-isolated or conflicting windows correctly, avoiding overdraws in training.
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): No explicit handling for partial type C seeds (only complete detection), so isolated 7/8 might draw full C even if input is sparse; potential issue if training didn't test overlaps between multiple seed types.
 * Missed: No function to extract or count all objects globally (e.g., no extract_objects helper), relying on per-cell scanning which is fine but inefficient for large grids; could add for debugging.
 * Consider problems where seeds are near edges (r > n-4 or c > m-4 skipped correctly, but partial draws might need adjustment).
 * Function draw_type_b is helpful but subtle: It draws inner borders (top/bottom partial, sides full), differing from type A by excluding corners on top/bottom.
 * Function draw_step is asymmetric (half vertical then horizontal), worked for training but untested in overlaps.
 * Function detect_type_c is essential and correct: Checks exact sparse pattern (corners + inner fills), prevents false positives.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all draws are relevant, though draw_type_a/b/c could be visualized for debugging (e.g., print grids).
 * Train examples all passed, so core logic (isolation count_same==1, no conflict) is solid; no mismatches reported.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows multiple incomplete or partial 4x4 frames of 7's across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 patterns in columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., forming box-like structures at positions like (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), etc., with some disruptions in rows 5-17 like missing inners or shifted 7's).
 * It makes partial sense: Appears to be drawing type C inner frames for multiple 7/8 seeds, with clipping or skipping in lower sections (e.g., rows 9-17 have sparser 7's, like isolated columns), and all-zero top/bottom rows preserved.
 * Does not look fully correct: Several patterns seem incomplete or overlapped incorrectly (e.g., row 5: 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7—extra 7's at col 4/5 don't fit clean type C; row 9 has 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7... suggesting failed isolation or conflict skips). Expected cleaner, non-overlapping full frames if input has isolated 7/8 seeds; differences likely from not handling partial inputs or multi-seed windows in test (e.g., count_same >1 skipped some, but left gaps).
 * Missing: No evidence of other colors (1,4,6) in output, so test input probably only has 7/8 seeds; if input has mixed, this would underdraw. Gaps in middle (e.g., cols 9-15 all 0 in some rows) suggest conflicts or no seeds there, but unclear without input.
 * The output is different from a "perfect" expectation of symmetric, complete 7-frames without extras/gaps; unknown why some areas (e.g., row 14: 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7) have partial side 7's—possibly edge clipping or detection failure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:45:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where input grids contain "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that represent starting points for specific shape types (A, B, C, or step/L-shaped), and the goal is to detect these seeds—either as isolated single cells or as complete pre-formed patterns—and replace the corresponding 4x4 (or bounded) area with a target color/value to "grow" or fill the shape, while avoiding overlaps or conflicts with other non-zero cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be "isolated": the is_isolated function checks that only the seed cell has the seed value (v) in the 4x4 area, and no other non-zero, non-target values exist elsewhere in that area to avoid conflicts; this prevents drawing over existing patterns.
 * Complete type C patterns are prioritized and detected first via detect_type_c, which looks for a specific hollow frame-like structure (corners on top/bottom rows, inner full on middle rows) already filled with the seed value (v=7 or 8?), and redraws it solidly with target 7; this handles pre-existing shapes without treating them as seeds.
 * Shape types are distinct: Type A is a full frame (top/bottom full, sides on middles); Type B is an inner-top/bottom with full sides (like a hollow square but shifted); Type C is corners on top/bottom and full inner on middles (reverse hollow); Step is an L-shape split (left half on top rows, right half on bottom rows).
 * Size is fixed at 4x4, but drawing bounds to grid edges (n,m) to avoid index errors; partial drawing if near edges.
 * v_map dictates exact type and target per seed: 1->B/1, 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7->C/7, 8->C/7; only these values trigger actions, others ignored.
 * Order matters: Complete C first to avoid overwriting existing C's as isolated seeds; then scan all cells for isolated seeds.
 * Subtle: detect_type_c expects exact match where non-drawn positions are 0, but only checks drawn positions against v; it may false-positive if partial matches exist.
 * No overlapping draws: Program draws to a separate output grid, but doesn't merge or resolve if multiple seeds claim the same cell (could overwrite with last draw).
 * Grid is list of lists, output same size, initialized to 0s; non-seed areas remain 0.
 * Easy to miss: Isolation counts only the seed v exactly once, but allows target value already present (though unlikely); conflicting means any non-0/non-target in the area except the seed position.
 * Bounds checking in all loops to prevent out-of-bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting and drawing isolated seeds and complete type C patterns without overlaps or bound errors.
 * The v_map and draw_dict setup worked well for mapping seeds to shapes/targets, ensuring specific behaviors per seed value.
 * detect_type_c and is_isolated functions are essential and accurate for prioritization and isolation checks, preventing false draws.
 * draw functions are precise for each type, with proper bounding to grid edges.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: if multiple overlapping 4x4 areas qualify (e.g., adjacent seeds), the program draws sequentially without merging, which could overwrite (though training didn't hit this).
 * In general (across implied prior attempts, though only one shown): Early attempts might have missed prioritizing complete C, leading to redrawing isolated parts of existing C's; or failed isolation by counting all v's incorrectly.
 * Function detect_type_c is helpful and correct; is_isolated is crucial for avoiding draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant; prior attempts might have had broken draw functions without bounds checking, causing index errors (don't use unbounded versions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 20x20 grid (inferred from rows) with multiple disjoint 4x4-ish patterns of 7s, resembling type C frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: alternating full/corners/sides pattern), and some partial/incomplete ones lower down (e.g., rows 9-12 cols 0-3 looks like a partial C or step, but with isolated 7s and 0s inside).
 * It looks mostly correct in structure—several clear type C draws (hollow-ish with 7s on expected positions) and no obvious out-of-bounds fills—but some areas (e.g., row 5 col 8 has a single 7, row 9 col 4-7 all 0s next to patterns) suggest possible missed isolated seeds or incomplete step draws; also, bottom half (rows 13+) has sparser, asymmetric 7s (e.g., row 13 cols 0-3 full sides but inner empty) that don't fully match any single type C or step, indicating potential overlap resolution failure or false isolation.
 * Compared to expected (mentally simulating rules on unknown input): Assuming input had clustered 7/8 seeds for C's and isolated others, output matches top clusters well (e.g., four horizontal C's in rows 1-4), but lower sections differ by having extra isolated 7s (e.g., row 9 col 8) where a full shape might be expected, or missing fills in potential step areas (e.g., row 14 cols 12-15 partial); this suggests the program drew some but skipped others due to strict isolation (e.g., if input had adjacent non-targets), making it not fully correct—unknown exact input, but output has inconsistencies like non-4x4 aligned patterns.

[2025-09-30 23:45:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

    return True

# Similar detect_type_b and detect_type_c are helpful for exact matches, but detect_type_c is missing in code (causes error).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) must be transformed into an output grid by detecting and "completing" specific 4x4 shapes (types A, B, C, or step) around those seeds, filling them with a target color while handling isolation, conflicts, and complete patterns to avoid overlaps or partial draws. The rules prioritize drawing full type C patterns if already present in the input, then isolated single seeds, but fixed size=4 and strict checks can miss clustered or partial setups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 4x4: Type A is a full outline square (top/bottom full width, sides left/right); Type B is a hollow square with shortened top/bottom (inner 2 columns only) and full-height sides; Type C is a thin frame (top/bottom only left/right edges, middle rows inner 2 columns); Step is a half-filled L-shape (left half on top 2 rows, right half on bottom 2 rows).
 * Seeds map to types and targets: 1->B with color 1; 2->A with 4; 3->B with 1; 5->Step with 6; 7/8->C with 7 (treated specially for complete detection).
 * Complete type C detection requires the exact frame pattern in the input's 4x4 (non-zeros only at corners on top/bottom and inner 2x2 center on middle rows, all matching the seed value v; everything else 0); if detected for 7/8 seeds, draw the same frame with 7 (no filling, just the frame).
 * Isolated seed drawing only triggers if exactly one seed of value v in the 4x4, and no conflicts (other cells are 0 or target color; other non-zero non-target blocks it); this prevents drawing over clusters but can leave partial or adjacent seeds undrawn.
 * Boundaries: Drawings clip at grid edges (rows/cols beyond n/m skipped); no overlapping resolution—later draws overwrite earlier ones (order is complete C first, then isolated scan top-to-bottom left-to-right).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Clustered seeds (e.g., multiple same v in one 4x4) fail isolation (count_v >1), leading to no draw even if they form a valid larger pattern; conflicts allow same-v or target but block others, potentially allowing partial propagation but not full completion; all shapes use size=4 fixed (no variable sizes); output starts all 0s, so undrawn seeds remain 0 (not copied); no handling for overlapping shapes from adjacent seeds (e.g., shared edges may get partial fills); v=0 or unmapped ignored; complete C only checked for 7/8 and only draws the frame, not a solid fill.
 * General considerations: Input may have partial patterns or clusters needing different detection (e.g., count partial matches or merge adjacent); colors are shape-specific (not all 7); scan order matters for overlaps; empty grid returns empty; training likely had simple isolated/complete cases, but test has complex layouts.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):

            if g[rr][cc] != expected: return False
    return True
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly identified and drew complete type C frames and isolated seeds for training examples, passing all 4 by applying v_map, isolation checks (count_v==1, no conflicts), and boundary clipping.
 * Worked well for simple cases: Isolated single seeds trigger full shape draws with target color; complete C detection draws the frame exactly as in input.
 * Did not handle clustered seeds: If multiple seeds (even same v) in a 4x4, isolation fails (count_v >1), leaving them as 0 in output—no partial completion or merging.
 * Strict conflict check blocks draws if any non-zero non-target in 4x4, but allows target or same v (though count_v still blocks multiples); this missed potential propagations in dense areas.
 * Fixed size=4 assumes all shapes 4x4, but may miss larger/variable patterns; no overlap resolution (e.g., adjacent shapes may overwrite inconsistently).
 * Scan order (complete C first, then isolated top-left to bottom-right) worked for training but caused partial overwrites in test clusters.
 * v_map covers key seeds but ignores others (e.g., 4,6?); output doesn't copy input seeds, always starts from 0s.
 * detect_type_c is helpful and accurate for exact frames but too strict—doesn't detect partial C or other types; draw functions are precise but only outline/fill as defined (no solid fills).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding all seeds or clusters); isolation check is basic but unhelpful for non-isolated cases (consider enhancing to count partial matches).
 * Training mismatches none (all correct), but unknown if training had clusters—likely simple isolated/complete only.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly draws multiple adjacent type C frames with 7 in the upper section (rows 1-4, columns 0-19 in 4-col groups: exact thin frame patterns like 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 / 0 7 7 0 / 7 0 0 7), and similar in rows 5-8 (left two and right one groups), suggesting complete C detection or isolated 7/8 seeds triggered draws there.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 9-16) shows incomplete or broken patterns—e.g., row 9 has top edges (7 0 0 7) in cols 0-3, 8-11, 16-19 but zeros in 4-7 and 12-15; rows 10-11 have middle inners (0 7 7 0) only in some groups (0-3, 8-11, 16-19); row 13 has top edges but shifted/merges in cols 12-19 (7 0 0 7 overlapping into next); rows 14-15 have partial middles only in 0-3, 12-15, 16-19 with gaps. This results in asymmetric, gapped shapes (e.g., no full C in cols 4-7 or 8-11 lower, and potential overwrites creating extra 7s in row 13 cols 16-19).
 * Differences from expected: Expected likely symmetric complete frames or filled shapes across the entire patterned area (mirroring upper completeness), but generated has undrawn gaps/misses in middle-lower groups, probably because clustered 7/8 seeds failed isolation (count_v >1 in those 4x4s) and weren't detected as complete C (input may have partial frames there). No step or other types visible (all 7s, so test focuses on C), but incompletes suggest program didn't propagate partials or handle adjacency—e.g., adjacent seeds should perhaps merge into larger C or draw despite count_v>1 if no conflict.
 * Overall, test output captures some frames but leaves partials as 0s or inconsistent, not matching a clean, rule-complete transformation; unknown exact input, but gaps indicate isolation/complete checks too restrictive for test's clustered layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

```python
def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.
    # Specific to seed 5; uses half = size//2 for split.
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where input grids contain "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that represent starting points for specific shape types (A, B, C, or step/L-shaped), and the goal is to detect these seeds—either as isolated single cells or as complete pre-formed patterns—and replace the corresponding 4x4 (or bounded) area with a target color/value to "grow" or fill the shape, while avoiding overlaps or conflicts with other non-zero cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be "isolated": the is_isolated function checks that only the seed cell has the seed value (v) in the 4x4 area, and no other non-zero, non-target values exist elsewhere in that area to avoid conflicts; this prevents drawing over existing patterns.
 * Complete type C patterns are prioritized and detected first via detect_type_c, which looks for a specific hollow frame-like structure (corners on top/bottom rows, inner full on middle rows) already filled with the seed value (v=7 or 8?), and redraws it solidly with target 7; this handles pre-existing shapes without treating them as seeds.
 * Shape types are distinct: Type A is a full frame (top/bottom full, sides on middles); Type B is an inner-top/bottom with full sides (like a hollow square but shifted); Type C is corners on top/bottom and full inner on middles (reverse hollow); Step is an L-shape split (left half on top rows, right half on bottom rows).
 * Size is fixed at 4x4, but drawing bounds to grid edges (n,m) to avoid index errors; partial drawing if near edges.
 * v_map dictates exact type and target per seed: 1->B/1, 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7->C/7, 8->C/7; only these values trigger actions, others ignored.
 * Order matters: Complete C first to avoid overwriting existing C's as isolated seeds; then scan all cells for isolated seeds.
 * Subtle: detect_type_c expects exact match where non-drawn positions are 0, but only checks drawn positions against v; it may false-positive if partial matches exist.
 * No overlapping draws: Program draws to a separate output grid, but doesn't merge or resolve if multiple seeds claim the same cell (could overwrite with last draw).
 * Grid is list of lists, output same size, initialized to 0s; non-seed areas remain 0.
 * Easy to miss: Isolation counts only the seed v exactly once, but allows target value already present (though unlikely); conflicting means any non-0/non-target in the area except the seed position.
 * Bounds checking in all loops to prevent out-of-bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting and drawing isolated seeds and complete type C patterns without overlaps or bound errors.
 * The v_map and draw_dict setup worked well for mapping seeds to shapes/targets, ensuring specific behaviors per seed value.
 * detect_type_c and is_isolated functions are essential and accurate for prioritization and isolation checks, preventing false draws.
 * draw functions are precise for each type, with proper bounding to grid edges.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: if multiple overlapping 4x4 areas qualify (e.g., adjacent seeds), the program draws sequentially without merging, which could overwrite (though training didn't hit this).
 * In general (across implied prior attempts, though only one shown): Early attempts might have missed prioritizing complete C, leading to redrawing isolated parts of existing C's; or failed isolation by counting all v's incorrectly.
 * Function detect_type_c is helpful and correct; is_isolated is crucial for avoiding draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant; prior attempts might have had broken draw functions without bounds checking, causing index errors (don't use unbounded versions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 20x20 grid (inferred from rows) with multiple disjoint 4x4-ish patterns of 7s, resembling type C frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: alternating full/corners/sides pattern), and some partial/incomplete ones lower down (e.g., rows 9-12 cols 0-3 looks like a partial C or step, but with isolated 7s and 0s inside).
 * It looks mostly correct in structure—several clear type C draws (hollow-ish with 7s on expected positions) and no obvious out-of-bounds fills—but some areas (e.g., row 5 col 8 has a single 7, row 9 col 4-7 all 0s next to patterns) suggest possible missed isolated seeds or incomplete step draws; also, bottom half (rows 13+) has sparser, asymmetric 7s (e.g., row 13 cols 0-3 full sides but inner empty) that don't fully match any single type C or step, indicating potential overlap resolution failure or false isolation.
 * Compared to expected (mentally simulating rules on unknown input): Assuming input had clustered 7/8 seeds for C's and isolated others, output matches top clusters well (e.g., four horizontal C's in rows 1-4), but lower sections differ by having extra isolated 7s (e.g., row 9 col 8) where a full shape might be expected, or missing fills in potential step areas (e.g., row 14 cols 12-15 partial); this suggests the program drew some but skipped others due to strict isolation (e.g., if input had adjacent non-targets), making it not fully correct—unknown exact input, but output has inconsistencies like non-4x4 aligned patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

    return True

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns in a zero-initialized output grid, with mappings to target colors and shapes (e.g., borders, frames, L-steps), while preserving complete pre-existing patterns and avoiding conflicts from overlapping or non-isolated seeds. The goal is to transform scattered or partial seeds into complete, colored patterns without overwriting unintended areas, handling edge cases like grid boundaries and multiple overlapping potential draws.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be isolated: Only draw if exactly one seed of the matching value exists in the 4x4 window and no conflicting non-zero, non-target values are present in the window (excluding the seed position itself).
 * Complete type C patterns (inner frames with corners and full middle-row inners filled with the same value) in the input must be detected and redrawn exactly in the output with their original value to preserve them, before processing individual seeds.
 * Pattern mappings are value-specific: 1/3 map to inner border (type B, color 1, blue); 2 to outer border (type A, color 4, yellow); 5 to L-shaped step (color 6, pink); 7/8 to inner frame (type C, color 7, dark red)—note that 7/8 use the same draw but preserve original if complete.
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size, but clipped at grid edges (rows/columns); drawing only affects valid bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Overlaps and conflicts: If a window has multiple same-value seeds or extraneous non-zeros (not the target color), skip drawing to prevent partial or corrupted patterns.
 * Subtle edge case: Type C detection checks for exact match where corners and inner middles are filled, but sides are empty—missing this leads to over-drawing or under-detection.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), so iterations must respect n/m dimensions; empty rows/columns in input should remain zero in output unless drawn.
 * No drawing for value 0 or unmapped values (e.g., 4,6 not seeds); output starts as all zeros.
 * Potential overlap between patterns: Prioritize complete type C detection first, then seed processing, but seeds might overlap with detected C's—current logic may redraw if not careful.
 * Visual symmetry: Patterns like type A/B are border-like (full top/bottom, sides only), type C is sparse (corners + inner horizontal fills on middle rows), step is asymmetric L.

draw_dict = {'a': draw_type_a, 'b': draw_type_b, 'c': draw_type_c, 'step': draw_step}
# Used in main loop for targeted drawing after isolation check.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles all 4 training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of seed isolation, mapping, and basic drawing for types A/B/C/step.
 * Worked: Complete type C detection and redraw preserves input frames accurately; seed processing skips non-isolated or conflicting windows correctly, avoiding overdraws in training.
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): No explicit handling for partial type C seeds (only complete detection), so isolated 7/8 might draw full C even if input is sparse; potential issue if training didn't test overlaps between multiple seed types.
 * Missed: No function to extract or count all objects globally (e.g., no extract_objects helper), relying on per-cell scanning which is fine but inefficient for large grids; could add for debugging.
 * Consider problems where seeds are near edges (r > n-4 or c > m-4 skipped correctly, but partial draws might need adjustment).
 * Function draw_type_b is helpful but subtle: It draws inner borders (top/bottom partial, sides full), differing from type A by excluding corners on top/bottom.
 * Function draw_step is asymmetric (half vertical then horizontal), worked for training but untested in overlaps.
 * Function detect_type_c is essential and correct: Checks exact sparse pattern (corners + inner fills), prevents false positives.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all draws are relevant, though draw_type_a/b/c could be visualized for debugging (e.g., print grids).
 * Train examples all passed, so core logic (isolation count_same==1, no conflict) is solid; no mismatches reported.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows multiple incomplete or partial 4x4 frames of 7's across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 patterns in columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., forming box-like structures at positions like (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), etc., with some disruptions in rows 5-17 like missing inners or shifted 7's).
 * It makes partial sense: Appears to be drawing type C inner frames for multiple 7/8 seeds, with clipping or skipping in lower sections (e.g., rows 9-17 have sparser 7's, like isolated columns), and all-zero top/bottom rows preserved.
 * Does not look fully correct: Several patterns seem incomplete or overlapped incorrectly (e.g., row 5: 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7—extra 7's at col 4/5 don't fit clean type C; row 9 has 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7... suggesting failed isolation or conflict skips). Expected cleaner, non-overlapping full frames if input has isolated 7/8 seeds; differences likely from not handling partial inputs or multi-seed windows in test (e.g., count_same >1 skipped some, but left gaps).
 * Missing: No evidence of other colors (1,4,6) in output, so test input probably only has 7/8 seeds; if input has mixed, this would underdraw. Gaps in middle (e.g., cols 9-15 all 0 in some rows) suggest conflicts or no seeds there, but unclear without input.
 * The output is different from a "perfect" expectation of symmetric, complete 7-frames without extras/gaps; unknown why some areas (e.g., row 14: 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7) have partial side 7's—possibly edge clipping or detection failure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:48:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seed" values (numbers like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or step shapes) in an output grid, using a target color/value for each seed type; complete type C patterns are detected and drawn fully, while isolated seeds draw their corresponding pattern only if no conflicts exist in the 4x4 area. The goal is to transform the sparse input into a filled output by expanding these seeds into outlines or filled shapes without overlapping or conflicting with existing non-zero values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size and must fit within grid bounds; drawing stops if out of bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Type A draws full top/bottom rows and side columns (like a rectangle outline but filled on edges).
 * Type B draws inner top/bottom rows (excluding corners) and side columns (like a hollow rectangle with open corners on top/bottom).
 * Type C draws corners on top/bottom rows and full inner rows (like a filled square with only corners on edges).
 * Step draws a diagonal-step fill: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows (like a staircase or L-shape rotation).
 * Detection for type C requires exact matching of a value in all inner 3x3 positions plus corners; it's drawn only if fully present in input.
 * Isolated seeds: A seed value (e.g., 1) must be the only instance of its value in the 4x4 area, with no conflicting non-zero/non-target values elsewhere in that area (allows 0s but blocks other numbers).
 * v_map assigns seed-to-pattern and target color (e.g., seed 1 draws type B with color 1; seed 7 draws type C with color 7).
 * Output starts as all 0s; drawings overwrite with the target color, but type C detection uses input values directly.
 * Subtlety: Overlapping drawings aren't handled (last draw wins), but isolation check prevents drawing on conflicts.
 * Grid is typically 20x20 based on output; empty areas (all 0s) remain 0 in output.
 * Easy to miss: Type C detection checks corners and inner fill specifically, but inner is 1<=i<size-1 and 1<=j<size-1 (3x3 inner), while edges only corners—mismatches return False.
 * Isolation counts exact seed occurrences (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero/non-target in non-seed positions.
 * No rotation or mirroring; patterns are axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Seeds like 7 and 8 both map to type C with target 7, suggesting synonyms or variants.
 * Program order matters: Draw complete type C first (full patterns), then isolated seeds (avoids partial overwrites).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws rectangle-like outline: full top/bottom, sides only.
    # Useful for seed type 'a' (e.g., expands seed 2 to color 4).

def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws hollow with inner top/bottom: excludes corners on top/bottom.
    # Key for seeds like 1 and 3 expanding to color 1.

def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws corners on edges, full inner rows: like a plus or filled interior.
    # Essential for complete patterns and seeds 7/8.

def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws half-left top, half-right bottom: staircase effect.
    # Used for seed 5 to color 6.

def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C: value in corners and full 3x3 inner.
    # Critical for identifying complete patterns without seeds.

def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Checks single seed occurrence and no conflicts (only 0 or target allowed elsewhere).
    # Prevents drawing over existing non-matching patterns.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations provided, but it builds on pattern detection logic.
 * Successfully handles training examples 1-4 fully (all correct), indicating solid base for seed mapping, isolation, and type C detection.
 * v_map and draw_dict are well-structured for extensibility (easy to add new seeds/types).
 * detect_type_c works precisely for complete patterns, avoiding false positives on partials.
 * is_isolated_seed correctly enforces single seed and no conflicts, which likely passed trainings.
 * draw functions are boundary-safe (check grid size), preventing crashes.
 * Program flow (init output, draw C first, then seeds) avoids overwriting complete patterns.
 * Potential issue: Step function assumes even size (half=2), but untested on odd sizes (not relevant here).
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no blob finding); relies on top-left scanning, which works but may miss if seeds aren't top-left.
 * Unhelpful: No function for merging overlaps or resolving conflicts beyond isolation check—could lead to incomplete fills if patterns adjoin.
 * The detection for type C expects uniform value v in specific positions but sets expected=0 elsewhere (edges middles), which is correct but subtle—easy to miss that non-corner edges are 0.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 4x4-ish clusters of 7's forming outline-like patterns (e.g., rows 1-4, cols 0-3: alternating 7/0 suggesting type C or B), with isolated extensions in lower sections (e.g., rows 5-8 have partial fills, rows 9-12 show sparser 7's).
 * It appears to have drawn several type C patterns (using 7 as color, matching v_map for seeds 7/8) in upper-left (e.g., positions like (1,0)-(4,3)), mid (around cols 7-10), and right (cols 16-19), plus some isolated seeds triggering more 7's lower down (e.g., row 9 col 0 starts a pattern).
 * Bottom rows (17-19) are all 0s, and top row 0 all 0s, suggesting no seeds/patterns there—makes sense if input has empty borders.
 * However, some areas look incomplete or asymmetric: e.g., row 5 has 7's at cols 0,3-4,7,19 but gaps (cols 8-16 mostly 0 except col 16), unlike uniform 4x4 blocks; row 9 has irregular 7's (e.g., col 4=0 instead of filled), hinting at partial draws or missed isolation.
 * Compared to expected: Assuming test input has scattered 7/8 seeds and some full type C, output should fully expand all isolated ones to 7-filled shapes without gaps; here, patterns like rows 1-4 cols 0-19 repeat every 5 cols (7 0 0 7 7 pattern), which matches type C drawing but skips some inners—possibly correct if input has partials, but likely misses step or other types (no evidence of color 1/4/6, only 7's, so v_map filtering worked but test may need more seed types).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (symmetric repeats suggest repeated type C detections), but appears incomplete in lower half (e.g., rows 13-16 have sparser 7's, like row 13: 7 0 0 7 0... with breaks), differing from expected full 4x4 expansions—possibly due to failed isolation checks on clustered seeds, or input has conflicts not handled; unknown why no other colors (1,4,6) appear, suggesting test input lacks those seeds or isolation failed.

[2025-09-30 23:48:26] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) must be transformed into an output grid by detecting and "completing" specific 4x4 shapes (types A, B, C, or step) around those seeds, filling them with a target color while handling isolation, conflicts, and complete patterns to avoid overlaps or partial draws. The rules prioritize drawing full type C patterns if already present in the input, then isolated single seeds, but fixed size=4 and strict checks can miss clustered or partial setups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 4x4: Type A is a full outline square (top/bottom full width, sides left/right); Type B is a hollow square with shortened top/bottom (inner 2 columns only) and full-height sides; Type C is a thin frame (top/bottom only left/right edges, middle rows inner 2 columns); Step is a half-filled L-shape (left half on top 2 rows, right half on bottom 2 rows).
 * Seeds map to types and targets: 1->B with color 1; 2->A with 4; 3->B with 1; 5->Step with 6; 7/8->C with 7 (treated specially for complete detection).
 * Complete type C detection requires the exact frame pattern in the input's 4x4 (non-zeros only at corners on top/bottom and inner 2x2 center on middle rows, all matching the seed value v; everything else 0); if detected for 7/8 seeds, draw the same frame with 7 (no filling, just the frame).
 * Isolated seed drawing only triggers if exactly one seed of value v in the 4x4, and no conflicts (other cells are 0 or target color; other non-zero non-target blocks it); this prevents drawing over clusters but can leave partial or adjacent seeds undrawn.
 * Boundaries: Drawings clip at grid edges (rows/cols beyond n/m skipped); no overlapping resolution—later draws overwrite earlier ones (order is complete C first, then isolated scan top-to-bottom left-to-right).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Clustered seeds (e.g., multiple same v in one 4x4) fail isolation (count_v >1), leading to no draw even if they form a valid larger pattern; conflicts allow same-v or target but block others, potentially allowing partial propagation but not full completion; all shapes use size=4 fixed (no variable sizes); output starts all 0s, so undrawn seeds remain 0 (not copied); no handling for overlapping shapes from adjacent seeds (e.g., shared edges may get partial fills); v=0 or unmapped ignored; complete C only checked for 7/8 and only draws the frame, not a solid fill.
 * General considerations: Input may have partial patterns or clusters needing different detection (e.g., count partial matches or merge adjacent); colors are shape-specific (not all 7); scan order matters for overlaps; empty grid returns empty; training likely had simple isolated/complete cases, but test has complex layouts.

    return True
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly identified and drew complete type C frames and isolated seeds for training examples, passing all 4 by applying v_map, isolation checks (count_v==1, no conflicts), and boundary clipping.
 * Worked well for simple cases: Isolated single seeds trigger full shape draws with target color; complete C detection draws the frame exactly as in input.
 * Did not handle clustered seeds: If multiple seeds (even same v) in a 4x4, isolation fails (count_v >1), leaving them as 0 in output—no partial completion or merging.
 * Strict conflict check blocks draws if any non-zero non-target in 4x4, but allows target or same v (though count_v still blocks multiples); this missed potential propagations in dense areas.
 * Fixed size=4 assumes all shapes 4x4, but may miss larger/variable patterns; no overlap resolution (e.g., adjacent shapes may overwrite inconsistently).
 * Scan order (complete C first, then isolated top-left to bottom-right) worked for training but caused partial overwrites in test clusters.
 * v_map covers key seeds but ignores others (e.g., 4,6?); output doesn't copy input seeds, always starts from 0s.
 * detect_type_c is helpful and accurate for exact frames but too strict—doesn't detect partial C or other types; draw functions are precise but only outline/fill as defined (no solid fills).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding all seeds or clusters); isolation check is basic but unhelpful for non-isolated cases (consider enhancing to count partial matches).
 * Training mismatches none (all correct), but unknown if training had clusters—likely simple isolated/complete only.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly draws multiple adjacent type C frames with 7 in the upper section (rows 1-4, columns 0-19 in 4-col groups: exact thin frame patterns like 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 / 0 7 7 0 / 7 0 0 7), and similar in rows 5-8 (left two and right one groups), suggesting complete C detection or isolated 7/8 seeds triggered draws there.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 9-16) shows incomplete or broken patterns—e.g., row 9 has top edges (7 0 0 7) in cols 0-3, 8-11, 16-19 but zeros in 4-7 and 12-15; rows 10-11 have middle inners (0 7 7 0) only in some groups (0-3, 8-11, 16-19); row 13 has top edges but shifted/merges in cols 12-19 (7 0 0 7 overlapping into next); rows 14-15 have partial middles only in 0-3, 12-15, 16-19 with gaps. This results in asymmetric, gapped shapes (e.g., no full C in cols 4-7 or 8-11 lower, and potential overwrites creating extra 7s in row 13 cols 16-19).
 * Differences from expected: Expected likely symmetric complete frames or filled shapes across the entire patterned area (mirroring upper completeness), but generated has undrawn gaps/misses in middle-lower groups, probably because clustered 7/8 seeds failed isolation (count_v >1 in those 4x4s) and weren't detected as complete C (input may have partial frames there). No step or other types visible (all 7s, so test focuses on C), but incompletes suggest program didn't propagate partials or handle adjacency—e.g., adjacent seeds should perhaps merge into larger C or draw despite count_v>1 if no conflict.
 * Overall, test output captures some frames but leaves partials as 0s or inconsistent, not matching a clean, rule-complete transformation; unknown exact input, but gaps indicate isolation/complete checks too restrictive for test's clustered layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

```python
def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.
    # Specific to seed 5; uses half = size//2 for split.
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where input grids contain "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that represent starting points for specific shape types (A, B, C, or step/L-shaped), and the goal is to detect these seeds—either as isolated single cells or as complete pre-formed patterns—and replace the corresponding 4x4 (or bounded) area with a target color/value to "grow" or fill the shape, while avoiding overlaps or conflicts with other non-zero cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be "isolated": the is_isolated function checks that only the seed cell has the seed value (v) in the 4x4 area, and no other non-zero, non-target values exist elsewhere in that area to avoid conflicts; this prevents drawing over existing patterns.
 * Complete type C patterns are prioritized and detected first via detect_type_c, which looks for a specific hollow frame-like structure (corners on top/bottom rows, inner full on middle rows) already filled with the seed value (v=7 or 8?), and redraws it solidly with target 7; this handles pre-existing shapes without treating them as seeds.
 * Shape types are distinct: Type A is a full frame (top/bottom full, sides on middles); Type B is an inner-top/bottom with full sides (like a hollow square but shifted); Type C is corners on top/bottom and full inner on middles (reverse hollow); Step is an L-shape split (left half on top rows, right half on bottom rows).
 * Size is fixed at 4x4, but drawing bounds to grid edges (n,m) to avoid index errors; partial drawing if near edges.
 * v_map dictates exact type and target per seed: 1->B/1, 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7->C/7, 8->C/7; only these values trigger actions, others ignored.
 * Order matters: Complete C first to avoid overwriting existing C's as isolated seeds; then scan all cells for isolated seeds.
 * Subtle: detect_type_c expects exact match where non-drawn positions are 0, but only checks drawn positions against v; it may false-positive if partial matches exist.
 * No overlapping draws: Program draws to a separate output grid, but doesn't merge or resolve if multiple seeds claim the same cell (could overwrite with last draw).
 * Grid is list of lists, output same size, initialized to 0s; non-seed areas remain 0.
 * Easy to miss: Isolation counts only the seed v exactly once, but allows target value already present (though unlikely); conflicting means any non-0/non-target in the area except the seed position.
 * Bounds checking in all loops to prevent out-of-bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting and drawing isolated seeds and complete type C patterns without overlaps or bound errors.
 * The v_map and draw_dict setup worked well for mapping seeds to shapes/targets, ensuring specific behaviors per seed value.
 * detect_type_c and is_isolated functions are essential and accurate for prioritization and isolation checks, preventing false draws.
 * draw functions are precise for each type, with proper bounding to grid edges.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: if multiple overlapping 4x4 areas qualify (e.g., adjacent seeds), the program draws sequentially without merging, which could overwrite (though training didn't hit this).
 * In general (across implied prior attempts, though only one shown): Early attempts might have missed prioritizing complete C, leading to redrawing isolated parts of existing C's; or failed isolation by counting all v's incorrectly.
 * Function detect_type_c is helpful and correct; is_isolated is crucial for avoiding draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant; prior attempts might have had broken draw functions without bounds checking, causing index errors (don't use unbounded versions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 20x20 grid (inferred from rows) with multiple disjoint 4x4-ish patterns of 7s, resembling type C frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: alternating full/corners/sides pattern), and some partial/incomplete ones lower down (e.g., rows 9-12 cols 0-3 looks like a partial C or step, but with isolated 7s and 0s inside).
 * It looks mostly correct in structure—several clear type C draws (hollow-ish with 7s on expected positions) and no obvious out-of-bounds fills—but some areas (e.g., row 5 col 8 has a single 7, row 9 col 4-7 all 0s next to patterns) suggest possible missed isolated seeds or incomplete step draws; also, bottom half (rows 13+) has sparser, asymmetric 7s (e.g., row 13 cols 0-3 full sides but inner empty) that don't fully match any single type C or step, indicating potential overlap resolution failure or false isolation.
 * Compared to expected (mentally simulating rules on unknown input): Assuming input had clustered 7/8 seeds for C's and isolated others, output matches top clusters well (e.g., four horizontal C's in rows 1-4), but lower sections differ by having extra isolated 7s (e.g., row 9 col 8) where a full shape might be expected, or missing fills in potential step areas (e.g., row 14 cols 12-15 partial); this suggests the program drew some but skipped others due to strict isolation (e.g., if input had adjacent non-targets), making it not fully correct—unknown exact input, but output has inconsistencies like non-4x4 aligned patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns in a zero-initialized output grid, with mappings to target colors and shapes (e.g., borders, frames, L-steps), while preserving complete pre-existing patterns and avoiding conflicts from overlapping or non-isolated seeds. The goal is to transform scattered or partial seeds into complete, colored patterns without overwriting unintended areas, handling edge cases like grid boundaries and multiple overlapping potential draws.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be isolated: Only draw if exactly one seed of the matching value exists in the 4x4 window and no conflicting non-zero, non-target values are present in the window (excluding the seed position itself).
 * Complete type C patterns (inner frames with corners and full middle-row inners filled with the same value) in the input must be detected and redrawn exactly in the output with their original value to preserve them, before processing individual seeds.
 * Pattern mappings are value-specific: 1/3 map to inner border (type B, color 1, blue); 2 to outer border (type A, color 4, yellow); 5 to L-shaped step (color 6, pink); 7/8 to inner frame (type C, color 7, dark red)—note that 7/8 use the same draw but preserve original if complete.
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size, but clipped at grid edges (rows/columns); drawing only affects valid bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Overlaps and conflicts: If a window has multiple same-value seeds or extraneous non-zeros (not the target color), skip drawing to prevent partial or corrupted patterns.
 * Subtle edge case: Type C detection checks for exact match where corners and inner middles are filled, but sides are empty—missing this leads to over-drawing or under-detection.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), so iterations must respect n/m dimensions; empty rows/columns in input should remain zero in output unless drawn.
 * No drawing for value 0 or unmapped values (e.g., 4,6 not seeds); output starts as all zeros.
 * Potential overlap between patterns: Prioritize complete type C detection first, then seed processing, but seeds might overlap with detected C's—current logic may redraw if not careful.
 * Visual symmetry: Patterns like type A/B are border-like (full top/bottom, sides only), type C is sparse (corners + inner horizontal fills on middle rows), step is asymmetric L.

draw_dict = {'a': draw_type_a, 'b': draw_type_b, 'c': draw_type_c, 'step': draw_step}
# Used in main loop for targeted drawing after isolation check.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles all 4 training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of seed isolation, mapping, and basic drawing for types A/B/C/step.
 * Worked: Complete type C detection and redraw preserves input frames accurately; seed processing skips non-isolated or conflicting windows correctly, avoiding overdraws in training.
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): No explicit handling for partial type C seeds (only complete detection), so isolated 7/8 might draw full C even if input is sparse; potential issue if training didn't test overlaps between multiple seed types.
 * Missed: No function to extract or count all objects globally (e.g., no extract_objects helper), relying on per-cell scanning which is fine but inefficient for large grids; could add for debugging.
 * Consider problems where seeds are near edges (r > n-4 or c > m-4 skipped correctly, but partial draws might need adjustment).
 * Function draw_type_b is helpful but subtle: It draws inner borders (top/bottom partial, sides full), differing from type A by excluding corners on top/bottom.
 * Function draw_step is asymmetric (half vertical then horizontal), worked for training but untested in overlaps.
 * Function detect_type_c is essential and correct: Checks exact sparse pattern (corners + inner fills), prevents false positives.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all draws are relevant, though draw_type_a/b/c could be visualized for debugging (e.g., print grids).
 * Train examples all passed, so core logic (isolation count_same==1, no conflict) is solid; no mismatches reported.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows multiple incomplete or partial 4x4 frames of 7's across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 patterns in columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., forming box-like structures at positions like (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), etc., with some disruptions in rows 5-17 like missing inners or shifted 7's).
 * It makes partial sense: Appears to be drawing type C inner frames for multiple 7/8 seeds, with clipping or skipping in lower sections (e.g., rows 9-17 have sparser 7's, like isolated columns), and all-zero top/bottom rows preserved.
 * Does not look fully correct: Several patterns seem incomplete or overlapped incorrectly (e.g., row 5: 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7—extra 7's at col 4/5 don't fit clean type C; row 9 has 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7... suggesting failed isolation or conflict skips). Expected cleaner, non-overlapping full frames if input has isolated 7/8 seeds; differences likely from not handling partial inputs or multi-seed windows in test (e.g., count_same >1 skipped some, but left gaps).
 * Missing: No evidence of other colors (1,4,6) in output, so test input probably only has 7/8 seeds; if input has mixed, this would underdraw. Gaps in middle (e.g., cols 9-15 all 0 in some rows) suggest conflicts or no seeds there, but unclear without input.
 * The output is different from a "perfect" expectation of symmetric, complete 7-frames without extras/gaps; unknown why some areas (e.g., row 14: 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7) have partial side 7's—possibly edge clipping or detection failure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seed" values (numbers like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or step shapes) in an output grid, using a target color/value for each seed type; complete type C patterns are detected and drawn fully, while isolated seeds draw their corresponding pattern only if no conflicts exist in the 4x4 area. The goal is to transform the sparse input into a filled output by expanding these seeds into outlines or filled shapes without overlapping or conflicting with existing non-zero values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size and must fit within grid bounds; drawing stops if out of bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Type A draws full top/bottom rows and side columns (like a rectangle outline but filled on edges).
 * Type B draws inner top/bottom rows (excluding corners) and side columns (like a hollow rectangle with open corners on top/bottom).
 * Type C draws corners on top/bottom rows and full inner rows (like a filled square with only corners on edges).
 * Step draws a diagonal-step fill: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows (like a staircase or L-shape rotation).
 * Detection for type C requires exact matching of a value in all inner 3x3 positions plus corners; it's drawn only if fully present in input.
 * Isolated seeds: A seed value (e.g., 1) must be the only instance of its value in the 4x4 area, with no conflicting non-zero/non-target values elsewhere in that area (allows 0s but blocks other numbers).
 * v_map assigns seed-to-pattern and target color (e.g., seed 1 draws type B with color 1; seed 7 draws type C with color 7).
 * Output starts as all 0s; drawings overwrite with the target color, but type C detection uses input values directly.
 * Subtlety: Overlapping drawings aren't handled (last draw wins), but isolation check prevents drawing on conflicts.
 * Grid is typically 20x20 based on output; empty areas (all 0s) remain 0 in output.
 * Easy to miss: Type C detection checks corners and inner fill specifically, but inner is 1<=i<size-1 and 1<=j<size-1 (3x3 inner), while edges only corners—mismatches return False.
 * Isolation counts exact seed occurrences (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero/non-target in non-seed positions.
 * No rotation or mirroring; patterns are axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Seeds like 7 and 8 both map to type C with target 7, suggesting synonyms or variants.
 * Program order matters: Draw complete type C first (full patterns), then isolated seeds (avoids partial overwrites).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws rectangle-like outline: full top/bottom, sides only.
    # Useful for seed type 'a' (e.g., expands seed 2 to color 4).

def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws hollow with inner top/bottom: excludes corners on top/bottom.
    # Key for seeds like 1 and 3 expanding to color 1.

def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws corners on edges, full inner rows: like a plus or filled interior.
    # Essential for complete patterns and seeds 7/8.

def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws half-left top, half-right bottom: staircase effect.
    # Used for seed 5 to color 6.

def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C: value in corners and full 3x3 inner.
    # Critical for identifying complete patterns without seeds.

def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Checks single seed occurrence and no conflicts (only 0 or target allowed elsewhere).
    # Prevents drawing over existing non-matching patterns.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations provided, but it builds on pattern detection logic.
 * Successfully handles training examples 1-4 fully (all correct), indicating solid base for seed mapping, isolation, and type C detection.
 * v_map and draw_dict are well-structured for extensibility (easy to add new seeds/types).
 * detect_type_c works precisely for complete patterns, avoiding false positives on partials.
 * is_isolated_seed correctly enforces single seed and no conflicts, which likely passed trainings.
 * draw functions are boundary-safe (check grid size), preventing crashes.
 * Program flow (init output, draw C first, then seeds) avoids overwriting complete patterns.
 * Potential issue: Step function assumes even size (half=2), but untested on odd sizes (not relevant here).
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no blob finding); relies on top-left scanning, which works but may miss if seeds aren't top-left.
 * Unhelpful: No function for merging overlaps or resolving conflicts beyond isolation check—could lead to incomplete fills if patterns adjoin.
 * The detection for type C expects uniform value v in specific positions but sets expected=0 elsewhere (edges middles), which is correct but subtle—easy to miss that non-corner edges are 0.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 4x4-ish clusters of 7's forming outline-like patterns (e.g., rows 1-4, cols 0-3: alternating 7/0 suggesting type C or B), with isolated extensions in lower sections (e.g., rows 5-8 have partial fills, rows 9-12 show sparser 7's).
 * It appears to have drawn several type C patterns (using 7 as color, matching v_map for seeds 7/8) in upper-left (e.g., positions like (1,0)-(4,3)), mid (around cols 7-10), and right (cols 16-19), plus some isolated seeds triggering more 7's lower down (e.g., row 9 col 0 starts a pattern).
 * Bottom rows (17-19) are all 0s, and top row 0 all 0s, suggesting no seeds/patterns there—makes sense if input has empty borders.
 * However, some areas look incomplete or asymmetric: e.g., row 5 has 7's at cols 0,3-4,7,19 but gaps (cols 8-16 mostly 0 except col 16), unlike uniform 4x4 blocks; row 9 has irregular 7's (e.g., col 4=0 instead of filled), hinting at partial draws or missed isolation.
 * Compared to expected: Assuming test input has scattered 7/8 seeds and some full type C, output should fully expand all isolated ones to 7-filled shapes without gaps; here, patterns like rows 1-4 cols 0-19 repeat every 5 cols (7 0 0 7 7 pattern), which matches type C drawing but skips some inners—possibly correct if input has partials, but likely misses step or other types (no evidence of color 1/4/6, only 7's, so v_map filtering worked but test may need more seed types).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (symmetric repeats suggest repeated type C detections), but appears incomplete in lower half (e.g., rows 13-16 have sparser 7's, like row 13: 7 0 0 7 0... with breaks), differing from expected full 4x4 expansions—possibly due to failed isolation checks on clustered seeds, or input has conflicts not handled; unknown why no other colors (1,4,6) appear, suggesting test input lacks those seeds or isolation failed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 23:52:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based pattern recognition and expansion system, where the program must identify "seeds" (specific numbers like 1,2,3,5,7,8) and complete patterns (especially type C, which are filled squares) in an input grid, then output a new grid with those seeds expanded into full shapes (frames, inner frames, filled areas, or step/L-shapes) using predefined drawing rules and colors/targets, while ensuring isolation and avoiding overlaps or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are 4x4 by default (size=4), but some like 'step' use size=6 in the v_map; boundaries must be checked to avoid out-of-grid errors (e.g., if start_r + size > n or start_c + size > m).
 * Processing order is critical: First detect and draw complete type C patterns (filled 4x4 squares with corners and inner 2x2 filled, borders empty) across the entire grid to handle pre-existing full shapes before seeds.
 * Seeds must be "isolated": Only expand if exactly one cell matches the seed value in the 4x4 (or size) area, and no conflicting non-zero/non-target values elsewhere in that area (except the seed itself at (0,0) relative).
 * v_map assigns types and target colors: 1->type B size1 color1 (minimal inner frame?), 2->A size4 color4 (full frame), 3->B size1 color1, 5->step size6 color6 (L-shape split at half), 7->C size? color7 (filled), 8->C size? color7; missing mappings (e.g., 4,6,9) imply no action.
 * Drawing functions overwrite output grid cells with the target color, but input grid may have mixed values; output starts as all zeros, so no preservation of input except via expansion.
 * Type A: Full frame (top/bottom full rows, sides on middles).
 * Type B: Hollow inner (top/bottom partial inner rows, sides full).
 * Type C: Corners on top/bottom, full inner rows on middles (like a filled square with border empty? Wait, detection expects corners and inner filled, but drawing does corners + inner fill).
 * Step: Upper-left half filled in top half rows, lower-right half in bottom half rows (diagonal split L).
 * Subtlety: Detection for type C checks exact match (value v at corners/inner, 0 elsewhere in 4x4), but drawing fills only specific parts—potential mismatch if input has extras.
 * Isolation check skips (0,0) for conflicts but counts all v matches; if multiple seeds overlap areas, later ones may overwrite or be skipped.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test); loops must handle edges without crashing.
 * No rotation/reflection; patterns are axis-aligned.
 * Potential overlaps: Drawing complete C first avoids double-processing, but isolated seeds might overlap drawn areas (since out is separate, but isolation checks input g).
 * Easy to miss: Size=1 for some B types might just be single cells or minimal; step size=6 is larger, could protrude.
 * v_map targets seem arbitrary (e.g., 7->7, but 2->4?); perhaps colors propagate or represent "growth" levels.
 * Unhelpful if detection too strict (e.g., type C requires exact 0s on borders) or if isolation counts wrong (e.g., adjacent seeds count as >1).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; prior iterations (implied) likely lacked complete type C detection, leading to over-expansion of partial patterns in trainings.
 * Worked well on all 4 training examples by correctly prioritizing full C draws and isolating seeds, avoiding overlaps.
 * v_map and draw_dict integration handled multiple seed types without errors in trainings.
 * Isolation function prevented drawing on clustered seeds, which was key for trainings.
 * detect_type_c is essential and accurate for identifying pre-filled patterns.
 * draw functions are boundary-safe and overwrite correctly on output grid.
 * No major misses in trainings, but potential subtlety: size=1 for B types may not draw anything visible (inner range 1 to 0 empty), which worked if trainings expected no-op.
 * Function draw_type_b may be broken for size=1 (top/bottom: range(2,0) empty; sides only if size>1), but if trainings had no size=1 B, it's fine—don't rely on it for small sizes without fix.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generated a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming frame-like structures (e.g., rows 1-2,4-5 show alternating 7-0 blocks resembling multiple type C or A/B frames starting at columns 0-3,6-9, etc.), plus some partial L/steps lower down (e.g., rows 9-13 have isolated 7s and blocks).
 * It looks partially correct: Consistent with expanding multiple 7-seeds (v_map 7->'c',7) into type C fills (corners + inners), and some step-like in bottom (e.g., row 13 has 7s at ends and middle gaps), assuming input has isolated 7s in those positions.
 * Does not look fully correct: Top row all 0s is expected (no patterns starting row 0?), but middle sections (rows 5-8) have incomplete blocks (e.g., row 5: 7s at 0,3-4,7,19 but gaps at 8-17), suggesting missed or partial draws—possibly overlapping seeds not isolated properly, or type C detection failed on partial input patterns, leading to under-drawing.
 * Bottom half (rows 14-19) mirrors top with more 7-blocks, but row 13 has asymmetric 7s (e.g., positions 0,3,8,11,16,19), which might be step draws (size=6?) but looks jagged—different from expected smooth frames if input has clean seeds.
 * Overall, output makes sense for scattered 7-seeds but likely incorrect in density: Too many isolated 7-blocks without full fills, implying is_isolated_seed rejected some due to conflicts (e.g., adjacent non-7s treated as conflicting), or v_map missing handling for clustered 7s that should merge into larger C.
 * Unknown why row 0 is all 0s while row 1 starts patterns—perhaps no seeds in row 0, but if input has edge seeds, draw functions clip correctly.

[2025-09-30 23:52:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) must be transformed into an output grid by detecting and "completing" specific 4x4 shapes (types A, B, C, or step) around those seeds, filling them with a target color while handling isolation, conflicts, and complete patterns to avoid overlaps or partial draws. The rules prioritize drawing full type C patterns if already present in the input, then isolated single seeds, but fixed size=4 and strict checks can miss clustered or partial setups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 4x4: Type A is a full outline square (top/bottom full width, sides left/right); Type B is a hollow square with shortened top/bottom (inner 2 columns only) and full-height sides; Type C is a thin frame (top/bottom only left/right edges, middle rows inner 2 columns); Step is a half-filled L-shape (left half on top 2 rows, right half on bottom 2 rows).
 * Seeds map to types and targets: 1->B with color 1; 2->A with 4; 3->B with 1; 5->Step with 6; 7/8->C with 7 (treated specially for complete detection).
 * Complete type C detection requires the exact frame pattern in the input's 4x4 (non-zeros only at corners on top/bottom and inner 2x2 center on middle rows, all matching the seed value v; everything else 0); if detected for 7/8 seeds, draw the same frame with 7 (no filling, just the frame).
 * Isolated seed drawing only triggers if exactly one seed of value v in the 4x4, and no conflicts (other cells are 0 or target color; other non-zero non-target blocks it); this prevents drawing over clusters but can leave partial or adjacent seeds undrawn.
 * Boundaries: Drawings clip at grid edges (rows/cols beyond n/m skipped); no overlapping resolution—later draws overwrite earlier ones (order is complete C first, then isolated scan top-to-bottom left-to-right).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Clustered seeds (e.g., multiple same v in one 4x4) fail isolation (count_v >1), leading to no draw even if they form a valid larger pattern; conflicts allow same-v or target but block others, potentially allowing partial propagation but not full completion; all shapes use size=4 fixed (no variable sizes); output starts all 0s, so undrawn seeds remain 0 (not copied); no handling for overlapping shapes from adjacent seeds (e.g., shared edges may get partial fills); v=0 or unmapped ignored; complete C only checked for 7/8 and only draws the frame, not a solid fill.
 * General considerations: Input may have partial patterns or clusters needing different detection (e.g., count partial matches or merge adjacent); colors are shape-specific (not all 7); scan order matters for overlaps; empty grid returns empty; training likely had simple isolated/complete cases, but test has complex layouts.

            if g[rr][cc] != expected: return False
    return True
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly identified and drew complete type C frames and isolated seeds for training examples, passing all 4 by applying v_map, isolation checks (count_v==1, no conflicts), and boundary clipping.
 * Worked well for simple cases: Isolated single seeds trigger full shape draws with target color; complete C detection draws the frame exactly as in input.
 * Did not handle clustered seeds: If multiple seeds (even same v) in a 4x4, isolation fails (count_v >1), leaving them as 0 in output—no partial completion or merging.
 * Strict conflict check blocks draws if any non-zero non-target in 4x4, but allows target or same v (though count_v still blocks multiples); this missed potential propagations in dense areas.
 * Fixed size=4 assumes all shapes 4x4, but may miss larger/variable patterns; no overlap resolution (e.g., adjacent shapes may overwrite inconsistently).
 * Scan order (complete C first, then isolated top-left to bottom-right) worked for training but caused partial overwrites in test clusters.
 * v_map covers key seeds but ignores others (e.g., 4,6?); output doesn't copy input seeds, always starts from 0s.
 * detect_type_c is helpful and accurate for exact frames but too strict—doesn't detect partial C or other types; draw functions are precise but only outline/fill as defined (no solid fills).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding all seeds or clusters); isolation check is basic but unhelpful for non-isolated cases (consider enhancing to count partial matches).
 * Training mismatches none (all correct), but unknown if training had clusters—likely simple isolated/complete only.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly draws multiple adjacent type C frames with 7 in the upper section (rows 1-4, columns 0-19 in 4-col groups: exact thin frame patterns like 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 / 0 7 7 0 / 7 0 0 7), and similar in rows 5-8 (left two and right one groups), suggesting complete C detection or isolated 7/8 seeds triggered draws there.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 9-16) shows incomplete or broken patterns—e.g., row 9 has top edges (7 0 0 7) in cols 0-3, 8-11, 16-19 but zeros in 4-7 and 12-15; rows 10-11 have middle inners (0 7 7 0) only in some groups (0-3, 8-11, 16-19); row 13 has top edges but shifted/merges in cols 12-19 (7 0 0 7 overlapping into next); rows 14-15 have partial middles only in 0-3, 12-15, 16-19 with gaps. This results in asymmetric, gapped shapes (e.g., no full C in cols 4-7 or 8-11 lower, and potential overwrites creating extra 7s in row 13 cols 16-19).
 * Differences from expected: Expected likely symmetric complete frames or filled shapes across the entire patterned area (mirroring upper completeness), but generated has undrawn gaps/misses in middle-lower groups, probably because clustered 7/8 seeds failed isolation (count_v >1 in those 4x4s) and weren't detected as complete C (input may have partial frames there). No step or other types visible (all 7s, so test focuses on C), but incompletes suggest program didn't propagate partials or handle adjacency—e.g., adjacent seeds should perhaps merge into larger C or draw despite count_v>1 if no conflict.
 * Overall, test output captures some frames but leaves partials as 0s or inconsistent, not matching a clean, rule-complete transformation; unknown exact input, but gaps indicate isolation/complete checks too restrictive for test's clustered layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

```python
def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.
    # Specific to seed 5; uses half = size//2 for split.
```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where input grids contain "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that represent starting points for specific shape types (A, B, C, or step/L-shaped), and the goal is to detect these seeds—either as isolated single cells or as complete pre-formed patterns—and replace the corresponding 4x4 (or bounded) area with a target color/value to "grow" or fill the shape, while avoiding overlaps or conflicts with other non-zero cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be "isolated": the is_isolated function checks that only the seed cell has the seed value (v) in the 4x4 area, and no other non-zero, non-target values exist elsewhere in that area to avoid conflicts; this prevents drawing over existing patterns.
 * Complete type C patterns are prioritized and detected first via detect_type_c, which looks for a specific hollow frame-like structure (corners on top/bottom rows, inner full on middle rows) already filled with the seed value (v=7 or 8?), and redraws it solidly with target 7; this handles pre-existing shapes without treating them as seeds.
 * Shape types are distinct: Type A is a full frame (top/bottom full, sides on middles); Type B is an inner-top/bottom with full sides (like a hollow square but shifted); Type C is corners on top/bottom and full inner on middles (reverse hollow); Step is an L-shape split (left half on top rows, right half on bottom rows).
 * Size is fixed at 4x4, but drawing bounds to grid edges (n,m) to avoid index errors; partial drawing if near edges.
 * v_map dictates exact type and target per seed: 1->B/1, 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7->C/7, 8->C/7; only these values trigger actions, others ignored.
 * Order matters: Complete C first to avoid overwriting existing C's as isolated seeds; then scan all cells for isolated seeds.
 * Subtle: detect_type_c expects exact match where non-drawn positions are 0, but only checks drawn positions against v; it may false-positive if partial matches exist.
 * No overlapping draws: Program draws to a separate output grid, but doesn't merge or resolve if multiple seeds claim the same cell (could overwrite with last draw).
 * Grid is list of lists, output same size, initialized to 0s; non-seed areas remain 0.
 * Easy to miss: Isolation counts only the seed v exactly once, but allows target value already present (though unlikely); conflicting means any non-0/non-target in the area except the seed position.
 * Bounds checking in all loops to prevent out-of-bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting and drawing isolated seeds and complete type C patterns without overlaps or bound errors.
 * The v_map and draw_dict setup worked well for mapping seeds to shapes/targets, ensuring specific behaviors per seed value.
 * detect_type_c and is_isolated functions are essential and accurate for prioritization and isolation checks, preventing false draws.
 * draw functions are precise for each type, with proper bounding to grid edges.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: if multiple overlapping 4x4 areas qualify (e.g., adjacent seeds), the program draws sequentially without merging, which could overwrite (though training didn't hit this).
 * In general (across implied prior attempts, though only one shown): Early attempts might have missed prioritizing complete C, leading to redrawing isolated parts of existing C's; or failed isolation by counting all v's incorrectly.
 * Function detect_type_c is helpful and correct; is_isolated is crucial for avoiding draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant; prior attempts might have had broken draw functions without bounds checking, causing index errors (don't use unbounded versions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 20x20 grid (inferred from rows) with multiple disjoint 4x4-ish patterns of 7s, resembling type C frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: alternating full/corners/sides pattern), and some partial/incomplete ones lower down (e.g., rows 9-12 cols 0-3 looks like a partial C or step, but with isolated 7s and 0s inside).
 * It looks mostly correct in structure—several clear type C draws (hollow-ish with 7s on expected positions) and no obvious out-of-bounds fills—but some areas (e.g., row 5 col 8 has a single 7, row 9 col 4-7 all 0s next to patterns) suggest possible missed isolated seeds or incomplete step draws; also, bottom half (rows 13+) has sparser, asymmetric 7s (e.g., row 13 cols 0-3 full sides but inner empty) that don't fully match any single type C or step, indicating potential overlap resolution failure or false isolation.
 * Compared to expected (mentally simulating rules on unknown input): Assuming input had clustered 7/8 seeds for C's and isolated others, output matches top clusters well (e.g., four horizontal C's in rows 1-4), but lower sections differ by having extra isolated 7s (e.g., row 9 col 8) where a full shape might be expected, or missing fills in potential step areas (e.g., row 14 cols 12-15 partial); this suggests the program drew some but skipped others due to strict isolation (e.g., if input had adjacent non-targets), making it not fully correct—unknown exact input, but output has inconsistencies like non-4x4 aligned patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns in a zero-initialized output grid, with mappings to target colors and shapes (e.g., borders, frames, L-steps), while preserving complete pre-existing patterns and avoiding conflicts from overlapping or non-isolated seeds. The goal is to transform scattered or partial seeds into complete, colored patterns without overwriting unintended areas, handling edge cases like grid boundaries and multiple overlapping potential draws.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be isolated: Only draw if exactly one seed of the matching value exists in the 4x4 window and no conflicting non-zero, non-target values are present in the window (excluding the seed position itself).
 * Complete type C patterns (inner frames with corners and full middle-row inners filled with the same value) in the input must be detected and redrawn exactly in the output with their original value to preserve them, before processing individual seeds.
 * Pattern mappings are value-specific: 1/3 map to inner border (type B, color 1, blue); 2 to outer border (type A, color 4, yellow); 5 to L-shaped step (color 6, pink); 7/8 to inner frame (type C, color 7, dark red)—note that 7/8 use the same draw but preserve original if complete.
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size, but clipped at grid edges (rows/columns); drawing only affects valid bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Overlaps and conflicts: If a window has multiple same-value seeds or extraneous non-zeros (not the target color), skip drawing to prevent partial or corrupted patterns.
 * Subtle edge case: Type C detection checks for exact match where corners and inner middles are filled, but sides are empty—missing this leads to over-drawing or under-detection.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), so iterations must respect n/m dimensions; empty rows/columns in input should remain zero in output unless drawn.
 * No drawing for value 0 or unmapped values (e.g., 4,6 not seeds); output starts as all zeros.
 * Potential overlap between patterns: Prioritize complete type C detection first, then seed processing, but seeds might overlap with detected C's—current logic may redraw if not careful.
 * Visual symmetry: Patterns like type A/B are border-like (full top/bottom, sides only), type C is sparse (corners + inner horizontal fills on middle rows), step is asymmetric L.

draw_dict = {'a': draw_type_a, 'b': draw_type_b, 'c': draw_type_c, 'step': draw_step}
# Used in main loop for targeted drawing after isolation check.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles all 4 training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of seed isolation, mapping, and basic drawing for types A/B/C/step.
 * Worked: Complete type C detection and redraw preserves input frames accurately; seed processing skips non-isolated or conflicting windows correctly, avoiding overdraws in training.
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): No explicit handling for partial type C seeds (only complete detection), so isolated 7/8 might draw full C even if input is sparse; potential issue if training didn't test overlaps between multiple seed types.
 * Missed: No function to extract or count all objects globally (e.g., no extract_objects helper), relying on per-cell scanning which is fine but inefficient for large grids; could add for debugging.
 * Consider problems where seeds are near edges (r > n-4 or c > m-4 skipped correctly, but partial draws might need adjustment).
 * Function draw_type_b is helpful but subtle: It draws inner borders (top/bottom partial, sides full), differing from type A by excluding corners on top/bottom.
 * Function draw_step is asymmetric (half vertical then horizontal), worked for training but untested in overlaps.
 * Function detect_type_c is essential and correct: Checks exact sparse pattern (corners + inner fills), prevents false positives.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all draws are relevant, though draw_type_a/b/c could be visualized for debugging (e.g., print grids).
 * Train examples all passed, so core logic (isolation count_same==1, no conflict) is solid; no mismatches reported.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows multiple incomplete or partial 4x4 frames of 7's across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 patterns in columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., forming box-like structures at positions like (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), etc., with some disruptions in rows 5-17 like missing inners or shifted 7's).
 * It makes partial sense: Appears to be drawing type C inner frames for multiple 7/8 seeds, with clipping or skipping in lower sections (e.g., rows 9-17 have sparser 7's, like isolated columns), and all-zero top/bottom rows preserved.
 * Does not look fully correct: Several patterns seem incomplete or overlapped incorrectly (e.g., row 5: 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7—extra 7's at col 4/5 don't fit clean type C; row 9 has 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7... suggesting failed isolation or conflict skips). Expected cleaner, non-overlapping full frames if input has isolated 7/8 seeds; differences likely from not handling partial inputs or multi-seed windows in test (e.g., count_same >1 skipped some, but left gaps).
 * Missing: No evidence of other colors (1,4,6) in output, so test input probably only has 7/8 seeds; if input has mixed, this would underdraw. Gaps in middle (e.g., cols 9-15 all 0 in some rows) suggest conflicts or no seeds there, but unclear without input.
 * The output is different from a "perfect" expectation of symmetric, complete 7-frames without extras/gaps; unknown why some areas (e.g., row 14: 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7) have partial side 7's—possibly edge clipping or detection failure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seed" values (numbers like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or step shapes) in an output grid, using a target color/value for each seed type; complete type C patterns are detected and drawn fully, while isolated seeds draw their corresponding pattern only if no conflicts exist in the 4x4 area. The goal is to transform the sparse input into a filled output by expanding these seeds into outlines or filled shapes without overlapping or conflicting with existing non-zero values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size and must fit within grid bounds; drawing stops if out of bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Type A draws full top/bottom rows and side columns (like a rectangle outline but filled on edges).
 * Type B draws inner top/bottom rows (excluding corners) and side columns (like a hollow rectangle with open corners on top/bottom).
 * Type C draws corners on top/bottom rows and full inner rows (like a filled square with only corners on edges).
 * Step draws a diagonal-step fill: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows (like a staircase or L-shape rotation).
 * Detection for type C requires exact matching of a value in all inner 3x3 positions plus corners; it's drawn only if fully present in input.
 * Isolated seeds: A seed value (e.g., 1) must be the only instance of its value in the 4x4 area, with no conflicting non-zero/non-target values elsewhere in that area (allows 0s but blocks other numbers).
 * v_map assigns seed-to-pattern and target color (e.g., seed 1 draws type B with color 1; seed 7 draws type C with color 7).
 * Output starts as all 0s; drawings overwrite with the target color, but type C detection uses input values directly.
 * Subtlety: Overlapping drawings aren't handled (last draw wins), but isolation check prevents drawing on conflicts.
 * Grid is typically 20x20 based on output; empty areas (all 0s) remain 0 in output.
 * Easy to miss: Type C detection checks corners and inner fill specifically, but inner is 1<=i<size-1 and 1<=j<size-1 (3x3 inner), while edges only corners—mismatches return False.
 * Isolation counts exact seed occurrences (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero/non-target in non-seed positions.
 * No rotation or mirroring; patterns are axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Seeds like 7 and 8 both map to type C with target 7, suggesting synonyms or variants.
 * Program order matters: Draw complete type C first (full patterns), then isolated seeds (avoids partial overwrites).

def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws hollow with inner top/bottom: excludes corners on top/bottom.

def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:

    # Essential for complete patterns and seeds 7/8.

def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws half-left top, half-right bottom: staircase effect.
    # Used for seed 5 to color 6.

def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C: value in corners and full 3x3 inner.
    # Critical for identifying complete patterns without seeds.

def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Checks single seed occurrence and no conflicts (only 0 or target allowed elsewhere).
    # Prevents drawing over existing non-matching patterns.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations provided, but it builds on pattern detection logic.
 * Successfully handles training examples 1-4 fully (all correct), indicating solid base for seed mapping, isolation, and type C detection.
 * v_map and draw_dict are well-structured for extensibility (easy to add new seeds/types).
 * detect_type_c works precisely for complete patterns, avoiding false positives on partials.
 * is_isolated_seed correctly enforces single seed and no conflicts, which likely passed trainings.
 * draw functions are boundary-safe (check grid size), preventing crashes.
 * Program flow (init output, draw C first, then seeds) avoids overwriting complete patterns.
 * Potential issue: Step function assumes even size (half=2), but untested on odd sizes (not relevant here).
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no blob finding); relies on top-left scanning, which works but may miss if seeds aren't top-left.
 * Unhelpful: No function for merging overlaps or resolving conflicts beyond isolation check—could lead to incomplete fills if patterns adjoin.
 * The detection for type C expects uniform value v in specific positions but sets expected=0 elsewhere (edges middles), which is correct but subtle—easy to miss that non-corner edges are 0.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 4x4-ish clusters of 7's forming outline-like patterns (e.g., rows 1-4, cols 0-3: alternating 7/0 suggesting type C or B), with isolated extensions in lower sections (e.g., rows 5-8 have partial fills, rows 9-12 show sparser 7's).
 * It appears to have drawn several type C patterns (using 7 as color, matching v_map for seeds 7/8) in upper-left (e.g., positions like (1,0)-(4,3)), mid (around cols 7-10), and right (cols 16-19), plus some isolated seeds triggering more 7's lower down (e.g., row 9 col 0 starts a pattern).
 * Bottom rows (17-19) are all 0s, and top row 0 all 0s, suggesting no seeds/patterns there—makes sense if input has empty borders.
 * However, some areas look incomplete or asymmetric: e.g., row 5 has 7's at cols 0,3-4,7,19 but gaps (cols 8-16 mostly 0 except col 16), unlike uniform 4x4 blocks; row 9 has irregular 7's (e.g., col 4=0 instead of filled), hinting at partial draws or missed isolation.
 * Compared to expected: Assuming test input has scattered 7/8 seeds and some full type C, output should fully expand all isolated ones to 7-filled shapes without gaps; here, patterns like rows 1-4 cols 0-19 repeat every 5 cols (7 0 0 7 7 pattern), which matches type C drawing but skips some inners—possibly correct if input has partials, but likely misses step or other types (no evidence of color 1/4/6, only 7's, so v_map filtering worked but test may need more seed types).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (symmetric repeats suggest repeated type C detections), but appears incomplete in lower half (e.g., rows 13-16 have sparser 7's, like row 13: 7 0 0 7 0... with breaks), differing from expected full 4x4 expansions—possibly due to failed isolation checks on clustered seeds, or input has conflicts not handled; unknown why no other colors (1,4,6) appear, suggesting test input lacks those seeds or isolation failed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based pattern recognition and expansion system, where the program must identify "seeds" (specific numbers like 1,2,3,5,7,8) and complete patterns (especially type C, which are filled squares) in an input grid, then output a new grid with those seeds expanded into full shapes (frames, inner frames, filled areas, or step/L-shapes) using predefined drawing rules and colors/targets, while ensuring isolation and avoiding overlaps or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are 4x4 by default (size=4), but some like 'step' use size=6 in the v_map; boundaries must be checked to avoid out-of-grid errors (e.g., if start_r + size > n or start_c + size > m).
 * Processing order is critical: First detect and draw complete type C patterns (filled 4x4 squares with corners and inner 2x2 filled, borders empty) across the entire grid to handle pre-existing full shapes before seeds.
 * Seeds must be "isolated": Only expand if exactly one cell matches the seed value in the 4x4 (or size) area, and no conflicting non-zero/non-target values elsewhere in that area (except the seed itself at (0,0) relative).
 * v_map assigns types and target colors: 1->type B size1 color1 (minimal inner frame?), 2->A size4 color4 (full frame), 3->B size1 color1, 5->step size6 color6 (L-shape split at half), 7->C size? color7 (filled), 8->C size? color7; missing mappings (e.g., 4,6,9) imply no action.
 * Drawing functions overwrite output grid cells with the target color, but input grid may have mixed values; output starts as all zeros, so no preservation of input except via expansion.
 * Type A: Full frame (top/bottom full rows, sides on middles).
 * Type B: Hollow inner (top/bottom partial inner rows, sides full).
 * Type C: Corners on top/bottom, full inner rows on middles (like a filled square with border empty? Wait, detection expects corners and inner filled, but drawing does corners + inner fill).
 * Step: Upper-left half filled in top half rows, lower-right half in bottom half rows (diagonal split L).
 * Subtlety: Detection for type C checks exact match (value v at corners/inner, 0 elsewhere in 4x4), but drawing fills only specific parts—potential mismatch if input has extras.
 * Isolation check skips (0,0) for conflicts but counts all v matches; if multiple seeds overlap areas, later ones may overwrite or be skipped.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test); loops must handle edges without crashing.
 * No rotation/reflection; patterns are axis-aligned.
 * Potential overlaps: Drawing complete C first avoids double-processing, but isolated seeds might overlap drawn areas (since out is separate, but isolation checks input g).
 * Easy to miss: Size=1 for some B types might just be single cells or minimal; step size=6 is larger, could protrude.
 * v_map targets seem arbitrary (e.g., 7->7, but 2->4?); perhaps colors propagate or represent "growth" levels.
 * Unhelpful if detection too strict (e.g., type C requires exact 0s on borders) or if isolation counts wrong (e.g., adjacent seeds count as >1).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; prior iterations (implied) likely lacked complete type C detection, leading to over-expansion of partial patterns in trainings.
 * Worked well on all 4 training examples by correctly prioritizing full C draws and isolating seeds, avoiding overlaps.
 * v_map and draw_dict integration handled multiple seed types without errors in trainings.
 * Isolation function prevented drawing on clustered seeds, which was key for trainings.
 * detect_type_c is essential and accurate for identifying pre-filled patterns.
 * draw functions are boundary-safe and overwrite correctly on output grid.
 * No major misses in trainings, but potential subtlety: size=1 for B types may not draw anything visible (inner range 1 to 0 empty), which worked if trainings expected no-op.
 * Function draw_type_b may be broken for size=1 (top/bottom: range(2,0) empty; sides only if size>1), but if trainings had no size=1 B, it's fine—don't rely on it for small sizes without fix.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generated a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming frame-like structures (e.g., rows 1-2,4-5 show alternating 7-0 blocks resembling multiple type C or A/B frames starting at columns 0-3,6-9, etc.), plus some partial L/steps lower down (e.g., rows 9-13 have isolated 7s and blocks).
 * It looks partially correct: Consistent with expanding multiple 7-seeds (v_map 7->'c',7) into type C fills (corners + inners), and some step-like in bottom (e.g., row 13 has 7s at ends and middle gaps), assuming input has isolated 7s in those positions.
 * Does not look fully correct: Top row all 0s is expected (no patterns starting row 0?), but middle sections (rows 5-8) have incomplete blocks (e.g., row 5: 7s at 0,3-4,7,19 but gaps at 8-17), suggesting missed or partial draws—possibly overlapping seeds not isolated properly, or type C detection failed on partial input patterns, leading to under-drawing.
 * Bottom half (rows 14-19) mirrors top with more 7-blocks, but row 13 has asymmetric 7s (e.g., positions 0,3,8,11,16,19), which might be step draws (size=6?) but looks jagged—different from expected smooth frames if input has clean seeds.
 * Overall, output makes sense for scattered 7-seeds but likely incorrect in density: Too many isolated 7-blocks without full fills, implying is_isolated_seed rejected some due to conflicts (e.g., adjacent non-7s treated as conflicting), or v_map missing handling for clustered 7s that should merge into larger C.
 * Unknown why row 0 is all 0s while row 1 starts patterns—perhaps no seeds in row 0, but if input has edge seeds, draw functions clip correctly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 23:58:51] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that represent starting points for drawing specific geometric shapes (types A, B, C, or step patterns) of fixed size 4, while also detecting and completing pre-existing type C patterns marked by 7 or 8. The goal is to produce an output grid where isolated seeds are expanded into their corresponding filled shapes using target colors, without overlapping or conflicting with existing non-zero cells, and prioritizing complete type C detections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 (or clipped if near edges), but must fit entirely within the grid bounds for seeds to be processed; partial fits are ignored.
 * Type A is a filled square border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); type B is an open square border (top/bottom inner rows only, sides on middle); type C is a filled square with only corners on top/bottom and inner fill on middle rows (like a hollow square but with middle filled except edges).
 * Step pattern is an L-shape: top half fills left half columns, bottom half fills right half columns (half=2 for size=4).
 * Seeds must be isolated: only the seed cell has the seed value in the 4x4 area, and no conflicting non-zero non-target values elsewhere in that area (zeros are okay).
 * Complete type C patterns (detected via 7 or 8 at top-left) are drawn first with color 7, overriding potential seeds; detection checks exact matching of expected filled positions (corners on borders, inner 2x2 on middles? wait, code shows borders only corners, middles inner fill—but code for draw_type_c fills middles fully inner? No, draw_type_c fills top/bottom only corners, middles inner 2 cells? Code: for non-border rows, range(1,size-1) which is j=1,2 for size=4, so inner two on sides? Wait, that's not full inner—subtle bug?).
 * v_map assigns types and targets: 1/3->type B color 1; 2->A color4; 5->step color6; 7/8->C color7; but 7/8 also trigger complete detection.
 * Output starts as all zeros, draws over it without regard to input non-zeros (so it can overwrite input, but isolation checks input for conflicts).
 * Subtle: draw functions clip to grid bounds but don't check for overlaps with existing output; multiple draws may overlap, last one wins (potential issue if shapes overlap).
 * Seeds are only processed if not part of a detected complete type C.
 * Easy to miss: type C detection expects v at corners only on top/bottom rows, and inner fill only on middle rows (but code's detect_type_c checks i==0 or size-1: only j==0 or size-1 expected=v, else 0; for middle i: j=1 to size-2 expected=v, else 0—so it's corners on borders, and inner row middles filled, but sides on middles empty? That's a plus-sign like? No, for middle rows: for j in 1 to 2 (size-1=3, range(1,3)=1,2), so positions (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) wait no, range(1,size-1)=1,2,3-1=2, so j=1,2; but size=4, j=0,1,2,3 so inner two per middle row. But draw_type_c mirrors: top/bottom: only start_c and end_c; middle: start_c+1 to + (size-2), so +1,+2, leaving sides empty on middle. So type C is like a frame with middle rows having only center two filled? Subtle asymmetry.
 * Isolation counts exactly one seed value in 4x4, and no non-zero non-target elsewhere (allows zeros and target, but target shouldn't appear pre-draw).
 * Process order: complete C first (top-left scan), then seeds (full scan, but skips if not isolated or out of bounds).
 * Colors: input seeds trigger specific output colors; 0s are background, non-seed non-zeros might be ignored or conflict.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled all 4 training examples by detecting isolated seeds and complete type Cs, drawing appropriate shapes without conflicts.
 * Worked: Isolation check prevented drawing over non-isolated seeds; complete type C detection and draw first avoided double-processing 7/8 areas; v_map correctly mapped seeds to types/colors/sizes.
 * Didn't work: Potential overlap handling missing (draws overwrite output zeros but not checked against other draws); type C draw/detect may have subtle fill mismatch (detect expects inner j=1 to size-2=v, but size-2=2, so only two cells per middle row, leaving j=0 and j=3=0 on middles—but if input has side fills, it might false negative).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detect_type_c is helpful for prioritizing complete patterns but may be too strict (e.g., if input type C has extra fills, it fails).
 * is_isolated_seed is essential for avoiding draws on clustered seeds but allows target color in area (rare, but could permit pre-drawn targets).
 * Draw functions are mostly correct but unhelpful for type C if puzzle expects full inner fill (unknown if mismatch causes issues).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though draw_type_b skips border corners on top/bottom which might be subtle to puzzle intent.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 7-filled patterns resembling type C or borders across the grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating [7,0,0,7] [0,7,7,0] patterns at columns 0-3,4-7,etc., suggesting multiple type C draws triggered by 7/8 seeds or detections.
 * It looks partially correct: empty top/bottom rows (0s), symmetric patterns in blocks (e.g., positions like (1,0)=7,(1,3)=7,(2,1)=7,(2,2)=7,(3,1)=7,(3,2)=7 matching type C's corner+inner partial fill), and similar in other blocks (e.g., columns 8-11,16-19), with some variations in later rows (e.g., row 5 has partial [7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,...] suggesting clipped or step-like but mostly type C).
 * Does not look fully correct: Some areas (e.g., row 9: [7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7]) show isolated 7s without full shape draw, implying seeds not isolated or missed; row 13 has [7,0,0,7,0,...0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7] with incomplete blocks (e.g., columns 12-15 partial), suggesting failed isolation or bound clip, but expected full shapes if seeds present—different from uniform training success, possibly due to overlapping/conflicting cells in input (unknown input grid, but output has empties where shapes should fill).
 * Missing: Potential step patterns (no clear L-shapes visible, e.g., no half-filled blocks); some 7s in output might overwrite input but leave gaps (e.g., row 6: [0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,...0,7,7,0] has breaks at columns 8+), indicating isolation failed on clustered 7s.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (drew several type Cs) but appears incomplete/inconsistent compared to expected full shape expansions, likely due to strict isolation rejecting clustered seeds or type C detect missing variants—note difference in sparser fills vs. training's clean shapes.

[2025-09-30 23:58:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing partial or incomplete visual patterns (like frames, borders, or step-like shapes) and generating an output grid where detected patterns are completed or "drawn" with specific colors/numbers, while preserving or omitting others based on rules for uniqueness, type, and overlap. The goal is to identify and fill specific 4x4 frame variants (types A, B, C) and other shapes like steps, using predefined colors, but only for isolated or matching instances, often resulting in a cleaned or completed visualization.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are primarily 4x4 squares with border-like structures: Type A is a full outer border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); Type B is an inner border (top/bottom partial rows excluding corners, sides on middle rows); Type C is an inner filled square (corners on top/bottom, inner 2x2 on middle rows)—subtle differences in which cells are filled are easy to miss, especially with overlaps.
 * Scattered or partial patterns (e.g., single corner cells with values like 1,2,3,5,7,8) should be completed only if they are unique in the grid (no duplicates via has_other_same_v check), mapping to specific draw functions and colors (e.g., 1->type_b with color 1, 2->type_a with 4, 5->step with 6); defaults to type_a with 4 if unmapped.
 * Complete patterns are detected via dedicated functions (detect_type_a/b/c) and drawn directly, but with conditions like checking if the grid has only one non-zero value (e.g., all 4s) for type_a; overlaps between complete and scattered drawings are resolved by prioritizing complete first, then overlaying scattered.
 * Step patterns (draw_step) fill a 4x4 in an L-shape: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows, used for value 5 with color 6—size may vary (e.g., 6 in some cases), and boundaries must respect grid edges.
 * Grids can have multiple pattern types coexisting (e.g., 1s for small frames, 4s for borders, 6s for steps, 7s for inner frames), requiring non-destructive overlay (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) counts all cells in a 4x4 window matching the value; if >1, skip drawing to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Subtle edge cases: Patterns may be clipped by grid boundaries (e.g., r + size > n), empty rows/columns must remain zero, and some patterns (like 7s in example 4) map to type_c with color 7, but draw_type_c is missing, causing errors.
 * Overlaps can corrupt outputs (e.g., drawing 4s over where 7s or 6s should be); scattered handling iterates from top-left, potentially missing later patterns if earlier ones overlap.
 * Non-zero values not in v_map default to type_a with 4, but this may overdraw; detection for complete patterns skips if not exact match.
 * In example 4, complex overlaps between 4/6/1/7 patterns require careful color assignment (e.g., 7 for type_c in specific positions).

# Similar detect_type_b and detect_type_c are helpful for exact matches, but detect_type_c is missing in code (causes error).
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * In training example 1 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s and 6s in rows 4-9 (e.g., full type_a at (4,4) and step at (5,4)), which overwrote blanks; expected blanks there, indicating over-detection of scattered patterns where uniqueness failed or complete detection was skipped—subtle issue with v_map applying draw_step/color 6 to value 5, but position (5,4) shouldn't trigger.
 * Training example 2 (CORRECT) worked fully, suggesting basic frame detection (types A/B) and overlay logic handles simple cases without overlaps well.
 * In training example 3 (INCORRECT), generated extra 4s in row 3 (positions 3-9 as full row) and rows 4-5 (partial 4s), plus mismatched bottom (row 6 full 4s instead of partial); expected blanks in rows 4-5 and partial 4s in row 6—likely scattered handling drew type_a at invalid positions like (3,3) without uniqueness check, and step/missing type_c caused incomplete bottom frame.
 * Training example 4 (INCORRECT) mismatched colors extensively: drew 4s where 7s expected (e.g., row 0 cols 12-19 as 4s instead of 7s/0s mix; row 4 col 16 as 4 instead of 7; entire lower sections like rows 12-19 used 4s for type_a instead of 7s for type_c), and preserved input 1s/6s but failed to complete type_c patterns—unknown reason for color mapping error, but v_map lacks 7->type_c/7, causing default to type_a/4.
 * handle_scattered_frames iterates top-left but draws on unique v only, yet overdraws in examples 1/3/4; helpful for isolation but misses if count >1 incorrectly flags uniques.
 * detect_and_draw_complete_patterns prioritizes complete draws but conditions like "len(non_zero_vs)==1 and v==4" too restrictive, skipping valid type_a in multi-value grids; no draw_type_c defined, leading to silent skips.
 * program overlays complete then scattered, which works for non-overlaps (example 2) but corrupts in overlaps (examples 1/3/4) by not resolving conflicts (e.g., scattered 4s overwrite expected blanks or 7s).
 * has_other_same_v is helpful and correct for uniqueness, but window is fixed 4x4 and may count outside patterns if near edges.
 * v_map is partially helpful (covers 1,2,3,5,7,8) but incomplete (no 4 direct, no 6/7 for type_c/step variants), leading to defaults that pollute outputs.
 * draw_step is helpful but only called for 5, and size=4 may not fit all (example 4 has 6s in non-step positions).

**Test output:**
 * No generated output due to execution error: "name 'draw_type_c' is not defined"—this occurs in detect_and_draw_complete_patterns where if detect_type_c(g, r, c) is true, it calls draw_type_c which doesn't exist; test input likely contains a type_c pattern (inner frame, e.g., with 7s) that triggers detection but fails drawing.
 * Error prevents any output, so it cannot match expected (unknown, but presumably completes type_c with color 7 in relevant areas); this breaks handling of inner filled patterns seen in example 4.
 * Previous attempts' outputs suggest test would overdraw 4s or skip 7s if error bypassed, making it incorrect—must define draw_type_c (similar to type_b but inner fill: top/bottom corners, middle inner 2x2) to handle.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains sparse numerical markers (1-8) representing the starting points or types of predefined shapes (like frames, hollows, steps, or sparse corners), and the output grid must reconstruct complete versions of these shapes using specific fill colors (e.g., 4 for type A, 6 for steps, 7 for type C variants), while leaving unmarked areas as 0 and avoiding overlaps or extraneous fills. The challenge involves detecting whether markers form complete patterns (e.g., type C) or isolated singles, expanding them correctly without bleeding into other areas, and handling variations in size or positioning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are mostly 4x4 (e.g., type A is a full border frame; type B is a hollow frame with inner top/bottom empty; type C has corners on top/bottom rows and a 2x2 inner block on middle rows, but only if all expected cells match the value exactly for detection).
 * Some patterns vary in size (e.g., step for value 5 uses 6x? but code defaults to 4 unless specified, leading to mismatches; v_map overrides size for some like 5:6).
 * Prioritize detecting "complete" patterns (like full type C blocks) before handling isolated singles, as complete ones should fill entirely without treating parts as singles.
 * Isolated markers (singles with no other same-value in local NxN window) trigger shape expansion based on value-to-shape mapping (e.g., 1 and 3 map to type B with color 1; 2 to type A with 4; 5 to step with 6; 7/8 to type C with 7), but only if unique locally (via has_other_same_v, which counts same-value cells in a size x size window starting at the marker).
 * Boundaries must be respected: shapes clip if they exceed grid edges (e.g., for r+i >=n or j>=m), but this can cause incomplete fills that don't match expectations.
 * No overlaps: Output should not redraw over existing fills, but code uses simple assignment, potentially overwriting if multiple detections hit the same cell (though not explicitly handled).
 * Values like 4,6 in input may be part of shapes but aren't triggers; output uses fixed colors per type, ignoring input values for fills except in detection.
 * Subtle: Type C detection requires exact match of all expected positions to v (corners on edges, inners on 1 to size-2 for middle rows), but draw_type_c only fills corners on top/bottom and inners on middles—missing side fills? Wait, code for draw_type_c fills only corners on top/bottom and j=1 to size-2 on middles, creating a sparse "C" like inner frame, but expectations show denser fills.
 * Step pattern (draw_step) fills left-half ascending then right-half descending, but size=6 in map may cause boundary issues or mismatches in 4x4 expectations.
 * Unmapped values default to type A with color 4, which may overfill unknowns.
 * Grid is 0-initialized output; inputs have 0s as empty, non-zero as markers/shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Local uniqueness check (has_other_same_v) uses fixed size=4 window even for size=6 steps, potentially false positives/negatives; counts all in window including self, so >1 means not unique.
 * Complete patterns (only type C handled) skip singles in that area, but code draws them first then singles, risking overwrites.
 * Outputs must exactly match expected densities: e.g., no extra fills in blank rows, precise hollowness.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Overall, the program correctly identifies and draws some isolated patterns (e.g., type A for 2's in train1 top/bottom matches expected; 1's as type B in train1/2 lower parts partially match hollowness).
 * Train1: Worked for top 4x4 type A (rows1-4, cols8-11 and 14-17 with 4's); bottom type A (rows7-10); 1-pattern (rows12-15 cols3-4 as sparse 1's); 6-patterns (rows12-15 cols9-10/14-15 as partial 6's). Failed by drawing extraneous step-like 4/6 in rows5-8 cols4-8/13-17 (e.g., row5: [4,6,6,4,...] vs expected all 0s), likely from misdetecting scattered 4/6 as singles/default type A/step, and row4 has extra 0-prefix but matches otherwise; also row10 all 0s good.
 * Train2: Worked for top 1-pattern (rows2-5 cols2-4 as sparse 1's); right 4-type A (rows2-5 cols6-9); bottom 4-type A (rows6-9 cols1-4, but row9 has extra [1,1,1,1] in cols8-10? Wait, generated row8 col9=1 extra, row9 cols8-10=1,1,1 vs expected 0s; left 1-pattern rows6-9 cols6-8 partial match but row8 col9 extra 1 breaks). Failed on bottom cleanup: extra 1's in row8 col9 and row9 cols8-10/9? (generated has row9 [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0] vs expected all 0s row9), likely from overlapping single draws or mis-sized type B for 1's.
 * Train3: Worked partially for top 4-type A (rows1-4 cols7-10, but row3-4 have extra 0-prefix? Wait, generated row3 cols1-6=0 good, but row4 full [0,0,0,4,4,4,4,4,4,4] vs expected row4 all 0s after top—overdraw from bottom pattern bleeding up). Failed majorly: drew bottom 4-pattern starting too high (rows4-10 with 4's in cols4/7-10, e.g., row4 full bottom, rows5-6 partial, row7 full but expected row7 as bottom start); top rows1-3 match, but row10 has extra [4,4,4,4,0,0,4,4,4,4] vs expected same but cols1-4 full; unknown why row4 overfill—likely single detection at row7 col0 triggering upward? No extraction of full objects, just per-cell.
 * Train4: Fully correct (not detailed, but implies mapping/draws worked for its specific patterns without extras).
 * Missed handling overlaps/priorities: Complete detection only for type C, but trains have no full C's, so singles overdraw (e.g., train1 middle blanks filled erroneously).
 * v_map is helpful but incomplete: 4 not mapped (defaults to type A=4, but may be shape parts); 6 not mapped (defaults, causing step-like in train1); 7/8 to type C good but draw_type_c broken (sparse vs dense expected).
 * has_other_same_v useful for isolation but fixed size=4 fails for larger/step (e.g., train? 5's); counts >1 correctly flags clusters but window from marker pos may miss distant same-v.
 * No object extraction: Per-cell scanning redraws fragments as full shapes, causing extras (e.g., train3 bottom bleed); need flood-fill or bounding box to group same-v connected components.
 * detect_type_c helpful but only used for complete C's (v=7/8?), and draw doesn't match its expectation logic (detection expects inners j=1-2, draw fills j=1-2 but only corners top/bottom—still sparse, mismatches dense expects).
 * Defaults to type A for unmapped (e.g., 4's as frames) overfills blanks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct: It fills extensive 7-patterns across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows2-5 cols1-5/7-11/etc. with corner/sparse 7's, rows7-18 similar blocks at cols1-5/8-12/13-17/18-20), creating multiple disjoint type C-like frames, but density is sparse (only corners and partial inners) matching broken draw_type_c, while input likely has clustered 7's that should form denser or connected shapes without gaps (e.g., row6 has isolated [7,0,0,7,...0,7] vs potential full block).
 * Overfills vertically/horizontally: e.g., row2-5 repeat pattern every 6 cols, but row6-9 shift/miss sides (e.g., row6 col9-16 all 0s interrupting), suggesting per-single draws without grouping, leading to fragmented output; expected probably denser unified shapes per cluster (e.g., full 4x4 blocks of 7's where input has partial 7's).
 * No blanks preserved: Entire grid filled with patterns, but input has 0-regions (e.g., row1 all 0s good, but row10-11 have partials that bleed); likely misdetects all 7's as isolated despite clusters, ignoring complete detection (no full type C triggered?).
 * Makes sense for code logic (scattered 7's trigger type C draws with color 7), but incorrect as it doesn't consolidate clusters into single dense fills—e.g., cols1-5 rows2-5 should be one block, not repeated corners; unknown exact input grid, but output fragmentation indicates lack of object extraction.
 * To fix: Add connected component analysis to group same-v 7's, draw one shape per group; adjust draw_type_c to full inner fill for density.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid containing seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) must be transformed into an output grid by detecting and "completing" specific 4x4 shapes (types A, B, C, or step) around those seeds, filling them with a target color while handling isolation, conflicts, and complete patterns to avoid overlaps or partial draws. The rules prioritize drawing full type C patterns if already present in the input, then isolated single seeds, but fixed size=4 and strict checks can miss clustered or partial setups.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always 4x4: Type A is a full outline square (top/bottom full width, sides left/right); Type B is a hollow square with shortened top/bottom (inner 2 columns only) and full-height sides; Type C is a thin frame (top/bottom only left/right edges, middle rows inner 2 columns); Step is a half-filled L-shape (left half on top 2 rows, right half on bottom 2 rows).
 * Seeds map to types and targets: 1->B with color 1; 2->A with 4; 3->B with 1; 5->Step with 6; 7/8->C with 7 (treated specially for complete detection).
 * Complete type C detection requires the exact frame pattern in the input's 4x4 (non-zeros only at corners on top/bottom and inner 2x2 center on middle rows, all matching the seed value v; everything else 0); if detected for 7/8 seeds, draw the same frame with 7 (no filling, just the frame).
 * Isolated seed drawing only triggers if exactly one seed of value v in the 4x4, and no conflicts (other cells are 0 or target color; other non-zero non-target blocks it); this prevents drawing over clusters but can leave partial or adjacent seeds undrawn.
 * Boundaries: Drawings clip at grid edges (rows/cols beyond n/m skipped); no overlapping resolution—later draws overwrite earlier ones (order is complete C first, then isolated scan top-to-bottom left-to-right).
 * Subtleties easy to miss: Clustered seeds (e.g., multiple same v in one 4x4) fail isolation (count_v >1), leading to no draw even if they form a valid larger pattern; conflicts allow same-v or target but block others, potentially allowing partial propagation but not full completion; all shapes use size=4 fixed (no variable sizes); output starts all 0s, so undrawn seeds remain 0 (not copied); no handling for overlapping shapes from adjacent seeds (e.g., shared edges may get partial fills); v=0 or unmapped ignored; complete C only checked for 7/8 and only draws the frame, not a solid fill.
 * General considerations: Input may have partial patterns or clusters needing different detection (e.g., count partial matches or merge adjacent); colors are shape-specific (not all 7); scan order matters for overlaps; empty grid returns empty; training likely had simple isolated/complete cases, but test has complex layouts.

            if g[rr][cc] != expected: return False
    return True
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (first shown) correctly identified and drew complete type C frames and isolated seeds for training examples, passing all 4 by applying v_map, isolation checks (count_v==1, no conflicts), and boundary clipping.
 * Worked well for simple cases: Isolated single seeds trigger full shape draws with target color; complete C detection draws the frame exactly as in input.
 * Did not handle clustered seeds: If multiple seeds (even same v) in a 4x4, isolation fails (count_v >1), leaving them as 0 in output—no partial completion or merging.
 * Strict conflict check blocks draws if any non-zero non-target in 4x4, but allows target or same v (though count_v still blocks multiples); this missed potential propagations in dense areas.
 * Fixed size=4 assumes all shapes 4x4, but may miss larger/variable patterns; no overlap resolution (e.g., adjacent shapes may overwrite inconsistently).
 * Scan order (complete C first, then isolated top-left to bottom-right) worked for training but caused partial overwrites in test clusters.
 * v_map covers key seeds but ignores others (e.g., 4,6?); output doesn't copy input seeds, always starts from 0s.
 * detect_type_c is helpful and accurate for exact frames but too strict—doesn't detect partial C or other types; draw functions are precise but only outline/fill as defined (no solid fills).
 * No extraction functions for objects (e.g., finding all seeds or clusters); isolation check is basic but unhelpful for non-isolated cases (consider enhancing to count partial matches).
 * Training mismatches none (all correct), but unknown if training had clusters—likely simple isolated/complete only.

**Test output:**
 * The test output partially makes sense: It correctly draws multiple adjacent type C frames with 7 in the upper section (rows 1-4, columns 0-19 in 4-col groups: exact thin frame patterns like 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 / 0 7 7 0 / 7 0 0 7), and similar in rows 5-8 (left two and right one groups), suggesting complete C detection or isolated 7/8 seeds triggered draws there.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Lower section (rows 9-16) shows incomplete or broken patterns—e.g., row 9 has top edges (7 0 0 7) in cols 0-3, 8-11, 16-19 but zeros in 4-7 and 12-15; rows 10-11 have middle inners (0 7 7 0) only in some groups (0-3, 8-11, 16-19); row 13 has top edges but shifted/merges in cols 12-19 (7 0 0 7 overlapping into next); rows 14-15 have partial middles only in 0-3, 12-15, 16-19 with gaps. This results in asymmetric, gapped shapes (e.g., no full C in cols 4-7 or 8-11 lower, and potential overwrites creating extra 7s in row 13 cols 16-19).
 * Differences from expected: Expected likely symmetric complete frames or filled shapes across the entire patterned area (mirroring upper completeness), but generated has undrawn gaps/misses in middle-lower groups, probably because clustered 7/8 seeds failed isolation (count_v >1 in those 4x4s) and weren't detected as complete C (input may have partial frames there). No step or other types visible (all 7s, so test focuses on C), but incompletes suggest program didn't propagate partials or handle adjacency—e.g., adjacent seeds should perhaps merge into larger C or draw despite count_v>1 if no conflict.
 * Overall, test output captures some frames but leaves partials as 0s or inconsistent, not matching a clean, rule-complete transformation; unknown exact input, but gaps indicate isolation/complete checks too restrictive for test's clustered layout.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seeds" represented by specific integer values (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger the drawing of predefined 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or a "step" shape) in an output grid, using a target color mapped to each seed value. The output expands or completes these seeds into full patterns while handling overlaps, isolations, and complete patterns without drawing over unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detecting and drawing complete "type C" patterns (hollow frames with inner fill except edges) before handling isolated seeds, as they may overlap or supersede individual seed drawings.
 * Isolated seeds are only expanded if they are the single occurrence of their value in a 4x4 area and there are no conflicting non-zero values (except the seed itself) in that area excluding the seed position—prevents false positives in dense grids.
 * Pattern sizes are fixed at 4x4 (or derived for "step"), but must respect grid boundaries to avoid index errors; partial draws are truncated if they exceed grid edges.
 * Seed-to-pattern mapping is strict via v_map: 2→type A (full border square), 3→type B (inner border square), 5→step (L-shaped or staggered fill), 7/8→type C (frame-like with inner fill); unknown values (e.g., 1, 4, 6, 9+) are ignored.
 * Output starts as all zeros; drawings overwrite with the target color but do not erase existing input—focus on additive pattern completion.
 * Subtle overlap handling: Multiple patterns can overlap, with later draws overwriting earlier ones; complete type C detection scans top-left corners systematically to catch all.
 * Edge cases: Empty grid returns empty; seeds near borders may draw partially; no rotation or scaling—patterns are axis-aligned and fixed orientation.
 * Potential misses: v_map colors (e.g., 7 for type C) must match seed intent; "conflicting" in isolation check excludes only the seed's own position but flags any other non-zero; type C detection expects exact matches including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def draw_type_a(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a full border square: top/bottom full rows, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 2; handles boundary checks.
```

```python
def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws an inner border square: top/bottom inner segments, sides on middles.
    # Useful for seed 3; skips outer edges on top/bottom.
```

```python
def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a frame: corners on top/bottom, inner fill on middle rows.
    # Key for seeds 7/8 and complete detections; creates hollow-ish with inner solid.
```

```python
def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4):
    # Draws a staggered L-shape: left half on top half, right half on bottom half.

```

```python
def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C match: checks corners/edges zero, inners filled with seed value.
    # Essential for prioritizing complete patterns; returns False on boundary overflow or mismatch.
    # Note: Expects v at corner, zeros elsewhere on edges, v in inner 2x2 per row.
```

```python
def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Counts occurrences of v in 4x4 (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero non-target elsewhere (except seed pos).
    # Critical for validating lone seeds; returns False on boundary issues or multiples/conflicts.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds and complete type C patterns, applying the v_map mappings without errors, and producing matching outputs.
 * What worked: Systematic scanning for type C first ensures complete patterns are drawn fully; isolation check prevents over-drawing in clustered areas; draw functions respect boundaries and overwrite correctly for overlaps.
 * What didn't work: No major failures in training, but potential subtlety in v_map—8 maps to type C with color 7 (not 8), which might mismatch if inputs use 8 as a distinct seed; step function assumes even size//2 without rotation handling.
 * The program ignores seeds not in v_map (e.g., if test has 1,4,6,9), which is correct per rules but could miss expansions if puzzle has more mappings.
 * detect_type_c is precise but assumes seed value v at corners—may fail if pattern is rotated or seed is inner (though rules suggest top-left seeds).
 * is_isolated_seed excludes only the seed position from conflict check but counts all v==v; works for isolation but might allow adjacent same-seeds if not conflicting (per rules, count==1 enforces single).
 * No extraction functions for full objects (e.g., no blob detection beyond 4x4); this is sufficient for fixed-size patterns but unhelpful for variable/large shapes—don't use blob tools here as patterns are rigid.
 * draw_type_b and draw_step are helpful but underused in training (likely no 3 or 5 seeds); type_a/c dominate for 2/7/8.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with all-zero top/bottom/most edges, and interior rows (1-17) filled with clustered 7's forming multiple 4x4-ish type C patterns (e.g., rows 1-4 show repeating [7,0,0,7,7,...] motifs suggesting 5+ overlapping/complete type C draws starting at cols 0,4,8,12,16).
 * It makes partial sense: Dense 7-seed inputs would trigger many type C draws (per v_map 7→'c',7), creating the observed frame-like clusters (e.g., rows 5-8 have a break in the middle patterns, possibly due to isolation failures or boundary trims); bottom half mirrors top with variations (e.g., row 9 has isolated 7's, suggesting partial steps or incomplete detections).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Several areas show asymmetric fills (e.g., row 5 col 8=0 but adjacent patterns filled, possibly missed isolation for a seed there); overlapping draws create solid blocks instead of clean frames (e.g., cols 4-5 in rows 1-4 are both 7, filling what should be inner/edge selectively per type C); last few rows (14-17) have incomplete right-side patterns (e.g., row 14 cols 12-16 partial), differing from expected clean truncations—likely due to is_isolated_seed flagging conflicts incorrectly in dense areas, or detect_type_c missing rotated/complete patterns not at top-left. Without the exact test input grid, can't confirm seed positions, but output has unexplained zero-gaps in middles (e.g., row 6 cols 8-16 all 0) that suggest undrawn isolated 7's or over-aggressive conflict detection; this differs from expected full coverage of all valid seeds into patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a grid-based visual puzzle where input grids contain "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that represent starting points for specific shape types (A, B, C, or step/L-shaped), and the goal is to detect these seeds—either as isolated single cells or as complete pre-formed patterns—and replace the corresponding 4x4 (or bounded) area with a target color/value to "grow" or fill the shape, while avoiding overlaps or conflicts with other non-zero cells.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be "isolated": the is_isolated function checks that only the seed cell has the seed value (v) in the 4x4 area, and no other non-zero, non-target values exist elsewhere in that area to avoid conflicts; this prevents drawing over existing patterns.
 * Complete type C patterns are prioritized and detected first via detect_type_c, which looks for a specific hollow frame-like structure (corners on top/bottom rows, inner full on middle rows) already filled with the seed value (v=7 or 8?), and redraws it solidly with target 7; this handles pre-existing shapes without treating them as seeds.
 * Shape types are distinct: Type A is a full frame (top/bottom full, sides on middles); Type B is an inner-top/bottom with full sides (like a hollow square but shifted); Type C is corners on top/bottom and full inner on middles (reverse hollow); Step is an L-shape split (left half on top rows, right half on bottom rows).
 * Size is fixed at 4x4, but drawing bounds to grid edges (n,m) to avoid index errors; partial drawing if near edges.
 * v_map dictates exact type and target per seed: 1->B/1, 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7->C/7, 8->C/7; only these values trigger actions, others ignored.
 * Order matters: Complete C first to avoid overwriting existing C's as isolated seeds; then scan all cells for isolated seeds.
 * Subtle: detect_type_c expects exact match where non-drawn positions are 0, but only checks drawn positions against v; it may false-positive if partial matches exist.
 * No overlapping draws: Program draws to a separate output grid, but doesn't merge or resolve if multiple seeds claim the same cell (could overwrite with last draw).
 * Grid is list of lists, output same size, initialized to 0s; non-seed areas remain 0.
 * Easy to miss: Isolation counts only the seed v exactly once, but allows target value already present (though unlikely); conflicting means any non-0/non-target in the area except the seed position.
 * Bounds checking in all loops to prevent out-of-bounds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully detecting and drawing isolated seeds and complete type C patterns without overlaps or bound errors.
 * The v_map and draw_dict setup worked well for mapping seeds to shapes/targets, ensuring specific behaviors per seed value.
 * detect_type_c and is_isolated functions are essential and accurate for prioritization and isolation checks, preventing false draws.
 * draw functions are precise for each type, with proper bounding to grid edges.
 * No major misses in training, but potential subtlety: if multiple overlapping 4x4 areas qualify (e.g., adjacent seeds), the program draws sequentially without merging, which could overwrite (though training didn't hit this).
 * In general (across implied prior attempts, though only one shown): Early attempts might have missed prioritizing complete C, leading to redrawing isolated parts of existing C's; or failed isolation by counting all v's incorrectly.
 * Function detect_type_c is helpful and correct; is_isolated is crucial for avoiding draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt—all provided are relevant; prior attempts might have had broken draw functions without bounds checking, causing index errors (don't use unbounded versions).

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 20x20 grid (inferred from rows) with multiple disjoint 4x4-ish patterns of 7s, resembling type C frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: alternating full/corners/sides pattern), and some partial/incomplete ones lower down (e.g., rows 9-12 cols 0-3 looks like a partial C or step, but with isolated 7s and 0s inside).
 * It looks mostly correct in structure—several clear type C draws (hollow-ish with 7s on expected positions) and no obvious out-of-bounds fills—but some areas (e.g., row 5 col 8 has a single 7, row 9 col 4-7 all 0s next to patterns) suggest possible missed isolated seeds or incomplete step draws; also, bottom half (rows 13+) has sparser, asymmetric 7s (e.g., row 13 cols 0-3 full sides but inner empty) that don't fully match any single type C or step, indicating potential overlap resolution failure or false isolation.
 * Compared to expected (mentally simulating rules on unknown input): Assuming input had clustered 7/8 seeds for C's and isolated others, output matches top clusters well (e.g., four horizontal C's in rows 1-4), but lower sections differ by having extra isolated 7s (e.g., row 9 col 8) where a full shape might be expected, or missing fills in potential step areas (e.g., row 14 cols 12-15 partial); this suggests the program drew some but skipped others due to strict isolation (e.g., if input had adjacent non-targets), making it not fully correct—unknown exact input, but output has inconsistencies like non-4x4 aligned patterns.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid with seed values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that represent starting points for drawing specific geometric shapes (types A, B, C, or step patterns) of fixed size 4, while also detecting and completing pre-existing type C patterns marked by 7 or 8. The goal is to produce an output grid where isolated seeds are expanded into their corresponding filled shapes using target colors, without overlapping or conflicting with existing non-zero cells, and prioritizing complete type C detections.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 (or clipped if near edges), but must fit entirely within the grid bounds for seeds to be processed; partial fits are ignored.
 * Type A is a filled square border (top/bottom full rows, sides on middle rows); type B is an open square border (top/bottom inner rows only, sides on middle); type C is a filled square with only corners on top/bottom and inner fill on middle rows (like a hollow square but with middle filled except edges).
 * Step pattern is an L-shape: top half fills left half columns, bottom half fills right half columns (half=2 for size=4).
 * Seeds must be isolated: only the seed cell has the seed value in the 4x4 area, and no conflicting non-zero non-target values elsewhere in that area (zeros are okay).
 * Complete type C patterns (detected via 7 or 8 at top-left) are drawn first with color 7, overriding potential seeds; detection checks exact matching of expected filled positions (corners on borders, inner 2x2 on middles? wait, code shows borders only corners, middles inner fill—but code for draw_type_c fills middles fully inner? No, draw_type_c fills top/bottom only corners, middles inner 2 cells? Code: for non-border rows, range(1,size-1) which is j=1,2 for size=4, so inner two on sides? Wait, that's not full inner—subtle bug?).
 * v_map assigns types and targets: 1/3->type B color 1; 2->A color4; 5->step color6; 7/8->C color7; but 7/8 also trigger complete detection.
 * Output starts as all zeros, draws over it without regard to input non-zeros (so it can overwrite input, but isolation checks input for conflicts).
 * Subtle: draw functions clip to grid bounds but don't check for overlaps with existing output; multiple draws may overlap, last one wins (potential issue if shapes overlap).
 * Seeds are only processed if not part of a detected complete type C.
 * Easy to miss: type C detection expects v at corners only on top/bottom rows, and inner fill only on middle rows (but code's detect_type_c checks i==0 or size-1: only j==0 or size-1 expected=v, else 0; for middle i: j=1 to size-2 expected=v, else 0—so it's corners on borders, and inner row middles filled, but sides on middles empty? That's a plus-sign like? No, for middle rows: for j in 1 to 2 (size-1=3, range(1,3)=1,2), so positions (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) wait no, range(1,size-1)=1,2,3-1=2, so j=1,2; but size=4, j=0,1,2,3 so inner two per middle row. But draw_type_c mirrors: top/bottom: only start_c and end_c; middle: start_c+1 to + (size-2), so +1,+2, leaving sides empty on middle. So type C is like a frame with middle rows having only center two filled? Subtle asymmetry.
 * Isolation counts exactly one seed value in 4x4, and no non-zero non-target elsewhere (allows zeros and target, but target shouldn't appear pre-draw).
 * Process order: complete C first (top-left scan), then seeds (full scan, but skips if not isolated or out of bounds).
 * Colors: input seeds trigger specific output colors; 0s are background, non-seed non-zeros might be ignored or conflict.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; it correctly handled all 4 training examples by detecting isolated seeds and complete type Cs, drawing appropriate shapes without conflicts.
 * Worked: Isolation check prevented drawing over non-isolated seeds; complete type C detection and draw first avoided double-processing 7/8 areas; v_map correctly mapped seeds to types/colors/sizes.
 * Didn't work: Potential overlap handling missing (draws overwrite output zeros but not checked against other draws); type C draw/detect may have subtle fill mismatch (detect expects inner j=1 to size-2=v, but size-2=2, so only two cells per middle row, leaving j=0 and j=3=0 on middles—but if input has side fills, it might false negative).
 * No prior attempts shown, but this attempt's detect_type_c is helpful for prioritizing complete patterns but may be too strict (e.g., if input type C has extra fills, it fails).
 * is_isolated_seed is essential for avoiding draws on clustered seeds but allows target color in area (rare, but could permit pre-drawn targets).
 * Draw functions are mostly correct but unhelpful for type C if puzzle expects full inner fill (unknown if mismatch causes issues).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though draw_type_b skips border corners on top/bottom which might be subtle to puzzle intent.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 7-filled patterns resembling type C or borders across the grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating [7,0,0,7] [0,7,7,0] patterns at columns 0-3,4-7,etc., suggesting multiple type C draws triggered by 7/8 seeds or detections.
 * It looks partially correct: empty top/bottom rows (0s), symmetric patterns in blocks (e.g., positions like (1,0)=7,(1,3)=7,(2,1)=7,(2,2)=7,(3,1)=7,(3,2)=7 matching type C's corner+inner partial fill), and similar in other blocks (e.g., columns 8-11,16-19), with some variations in later rows (e.g., row 5 has partial [7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7,0,...] suggesting clipped or step-like but mostly type C).
 * Does not look fully correct: Some areas (e.g., row 9: [7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,7,0,0,7]) show isolated 7s without full shape draw, implying seeds not isolated or missed; row 13 has [7,0,0,7,0,...0,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,7] with incomplete blocks (e.g., columns 12-15 partial), suggesting failed isolation or bound clip, but expected full shapes if seeds present—different from uniform training success, possibly due to overlapping/conflicting cells in input (unknown input grid, but output has empties where shapes should fill).
 * Missing: Potential step patterns (no clear L-shapes visible, e.g., no half-filled blocks); some 7s in output might overwrite input but leave gaps (e.g., row 6: [0,7,7,0,0,7,7,0,0,0,...0,7,7,0] has breaks at columns 8+), indicating isolation failed on clustered 7s.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (drew several type Cs) but appears incomplete/inconsistent compared to expected full shape expansions, likely due to strict isolation rejecting clustered seeds or type C detect missing variants—note difference in sparser fills vs. training's clean shapes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where specific seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) in the input grid act as triggers to draw predefined 4x4 shapes (type A: square frame, type B: inner square frame, type C: partial inner fill, step: L-shaped stair) in an output grid using mapped target colors, with additional detection for existing type C patterns in the input to replicate them directly. The goal is to process isolated seeds without overlaps or conflicts, producing a clean output that completes or mirrors these shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be strictly isolated in their 4x4 bounding box: exactly one cell matches the seed value, all other cells are 0 or the target color (no conflicting non-zero values except at the seed position), and the shape must fit within grid bounds without truncation.
 * Shape drawing is top-left anchored from the seed position, with fixed size=4; truncation occurs if near edges, but seeds near edges are invalid if the full shape can't fit (enforced in is_isolated_seed by returning False if out of bounds).
 * Type A draws a full square outline (top/bottom/full rows, sides/verticals on middles); type B draws an inner hollow square (top/bottom inner segments excluding corners, sides including corners); type C draws top/bottom corners only and middle rows with inner 2 cells filled (for size=4: positions 1-2, missing outer edges); step draws an L-shape (upper half left-filled, lower half right-filled, split at half=2).
 * Type C has dual handling: seeds 7/8 trigger drawing via mapping, but detect_type_c scans the entire input for existing partial type C patterns (corners and inner middles non-zero, rest 0) and overrides by drawing with the detected value— this can lead to redundancies or misses if seeds overlap with detected patterns.
 * Mapping is value-specific: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; unlisted values are ignored, and output starts as all 0s with no overwriting (last draw wins on conflicts).
 * Subtle edge cases: shapes don't wrap or clip creatively—strict bounding; isolation check excludes the seed itself from "conflicting" but counts it in the single-v check; detect_type_c only triggers if the pattern matches exactly (corners + inner cross, but not full sides), potentially missing variants.
 * Overlaps between multiple seeds/shapes aren't resolved (output may have mixed colors if drawn multiple times, but isolation prevents most); empty areas remain 0.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., 20x20 in test), so bounds checking is critical to avoid index errors.
 * Potential misses: type C detection uses the top-left value as 'v' but assumes uniform color—fails if multi-color; step's half-split is integer div (even sizes only, no odd handling); no rotation/reflection of shapes, always axis-aligned from seed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, successfully identifying isolated seeds and drawing shapes without bound errors or isolation failures.
 * Worked well for basic seed-triggered shapes (A, B, step, C via mapping) and type C detection, as evidenced by perfect training scores.
 * Did not work for potential overlaps or non-uniform type C in training (but wasn't tested); isolation check helpfully prevented invalid seeds.
 * Mapping and draw functions are solid and reusable, but draw_type_c is subtly incomplete (middle rows fill only inner 2/3 for size=4, not full inner—may miss dense patterns).
 * detect_type_c is helpful for input replication but narrow (only detects specific sparse C variant; misses full squares or other fills)—could be expanded.
 * is_isolated_seed is essential and correct, enforcing single seed + no conflicts, but skips seed position in conflict check (intentional, but subtle).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (draw_*, detect_*, is_isolated_seed) are relevant, though draw_type_b and draw_step could be verified for exactness (type B excludes corner inners on top/bottom?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows a 20x20 grid with multiple clustered 4x4 patterns of 7's and 0's, resembling several adjacent or overlapping type C shapes (e.g., rows 1-4: alternating 7's in columns suggesting frames or partial C's at positions like (1,0), (1,3), etc.; similar blocks in rows 5-8, 9-12, 13-16 with some truncations or incompletes like missing fills in row 5 cols 8-15).
 * Patterns include hollow-like frames (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3: 7 at edges, 0 inner) and partial steps or C's (e.g., row 5: 7's at start/end but gaps), with heavy use of 7 (from mapping 7/8->C/7 and detection), and large empty areas (e.g., cols 9-15 in upper rows have sparse 7's, bottom 3 rows all 0's).
 * It does not look fully correct: expected output should likely mirror or complete symmetric/full shapes across the grid (test input probably has multiple 7/8 seeds or pre-C patterns in a tiled fashion), but generated has asymmetries (e.g., row 5 has isolated 7's at col 7 and 16-17, suggesting missed isolation or partial draws); overlaps cause merged 7's instead of clean separation; empty bottom suggests no seeds there, but if input has them, it's a miss—differences likely from strict isolation rejecting edge seeds or detect_type_c failing on non-exact patterns (unknown without input, but patterns look fragmented vs. expected cohesive tiles).
 * Missing potential step or other shapes (all 7's imply only C triggers in test input); no color variety (only 7 and 0) suggests test focuses on C, but incompletes (e.g., row 9-12 has gaps in middles) differ from expected full draws—program may undraw inners in type C.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing "seed" values (like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns in a zero-initialized output grid, with mappings to target colors and shapes (e.g., borders, frames, L-steps), while preserving complete pre-existing patterns and avoiding conflicts from overlapping or non-isolated seeds. The goal is to transform scattered or partial seeds into complete, colored patterns without overwriting unintended areas, handling edge cases like grid boundaries and multiple overlapping potential draws.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Seeds must be isolated: Only draw if exactly one seed of the matching value exists in the 4x4 window and no conflicting non-zero, non-target values are present in the window (excluding the seed position itself).
 * Complete type C patterns (inner frames with corners and full middle-row inners filled with the same value) in the input must be detected and redrawn exactly in the output with their original value to preserve them, before processing individual seeds.
 * Pattern mappings are value-specific: 1/3 map to inner border (type B, color 1, blue); 2 to outer border (type A, color 4, yellow); 5 to L-shaped step (color 6, pink); 7/8 to inner frame (type C, color 7, dark red)—note that 7/8 use the same draw but preserve original if complete.
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size, but clipped at grid edges (rows/columns); drawing only affects valid bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Overlaps and conflicts: If a window has multiple same-value seeds or extraneous non-zeros (not the target color), skip drawing to prevent partial or corrupted patterns.
 * Subtle edge case: Type C detection checks for exact match where corners and inner middles are filled, but sides are empty—missing this leads to over-drawing or under-detection.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), so iterations must respect n/m dimensions; empty rows/columns in input should remain zero in output unless drawn.
 * No drawing for value 0 or unmapped values (e.g., 4,6 not seeds); output starts as all zeros.
 * Potential overlap between patterns: Prioritize complete type C detection first, then seed processing, but seeds might overlap with detected C's—current logic may redraw if not careful.
 * Visual symmetry: Patterns like type A/B are border-like (full top/bottom, sides only), type C is sparse (corners + inner horizontal fills on middle rows), step is asymmetric L.

draw_dict = {'a': draw_type_a, 'b': draw_type_b, 'c': draw_type_c, 'step': draw_step}
# Used in main loop for targeted drawing after isolation check.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handles all 4 training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid understanding of seed isolation, mapping, and basic drawing for types A/B/C/step.
 * Worked: Complete type C detection and redraw preserves input frames accurately; seed processing skips non-isolated or conflicting windows correctly, avoiding overdraws in training.
 * Did not work (inferred from structure): No explicit handling for partial type C seeds (only complete detection), so isolated 7/8 might draw full C even if input is sparse; potential issue if training didn't test overlaps between multiple seed types.
 * Missed: No function to extract or count all objects globally (e.g., no extract_objects helper), relying on per-cell scanning which is fine but inefficient for large grids; could add for debugging.
 * Consider problems where seeds are near edges (r > n-4 or c > m-4 skipped correctly, but partial draws might need adjustment).
 * Function draw_type_b is helpful but subtle: It draws inner borders (top/bottom partial, sides full), differing from type A by excluding corners on top/bottom.
 * Function draw_step is asymmetric (half vertical then horizontal), worked for training but untested in overlaps.
 * Function detect_type_c is essential and correct: Checks exact sparse pattern (corners + inner fills), prevents false positives.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all draws are relevant, though draw_type_a/b/c could be visualized for debugging (e.g., print grids).
 * Train examples all passed, so core logic (isolation count_same==1, no conflict) is solid; no mismatches reported.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows multiple incomplete or partial 4x4 frames of 7's across the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 have repeating 7 0 0 7 / 0 7 7 0 patterns in columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., forming box-like structures at positions like (1,0), (1,4), (1,8), etc., with some disruptions in rows 5-17 like missing inners or shifted 7's).
 * It makes partial sense: Appears to be drawing type C inner frames for multiple 7/8 seeds, with clipping or skipping in lower sections (e.g., rows 9-17 have sparser 7's, like isolated columns), and all-zero top/bottom rows preserved.
 * Does not look fully correct: Several patterns seem incomplete or overlapped incorrectly (e.g., row 5: 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7—extra 7's at col 4/5 don't fit clean type C; row 9 has 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7... suggesting failed isolation or conflict skips). Expected cleaner, non-overlapping full frames if input has isolated 7/8 seeds; differences likely from not handling partial inputs or multi-seed windows in test (e.g., count_same >1 skipped some, but left gaps).
 * Missing: No evidence of other colors (1,4,6) in output, so test input probably only has 7/8 seeds; if input has mixed, this would underdraw. Gaps in middle (e.g., cols 9-15 all 0 in some rows) suggest conflicts or no seeds there, but unclear without input.
 * The output is different from a "perfect" expectation of symmetric, complete 7-frames without extras/gaps; unknown why some areas (e.g., row 14: 7 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 0 7) have partial side 7's—possibly edge clipping or detection failure.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where an input grid contains "seed" values (numbers like 1,2,3,5,7,8) that trigger the drawing of specific 4x4 patterns (types A, B, C, or step shapes) in an output grid, using a target color/value for each seed type; complete type C patterns are detected and drawn fully, while isolated seeds draw their corresponding pattern only if no conflicts exist in the 4x4 area. The goal is to transform the sparse input into a filled output by expanding these seeds into outlines or filled shapes without overlapping or conflicting with existing non-zero values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are always 4x4 size and must fit within grid bounds; drawing stops if out of bounds to avoid index errors.
 * Type A draws full top/bottom rows and side columns (like a rectangle outline but filled on edges).
 * Type B draws inner top/bottom rows (excluding corners) and side columns (like a hollow rectangle with open corners on top/bottom).
 * Type C draws corners on top/bottom rows and full inner rows (like a filled square with only corners on edges).
 * Step draws a diagonal-step fill: left half on top half rows, right half on bottom half rows (like a staircase or L-shape rotation).
 * Detection for type C requires exact matching of a value in all inner 3x3 positions plus corners; it's drawn only if fully present in input.
 * Isolated seeds: A seed value (e.g., 1) must be the only instance of its value in the 4x4 area, with no conflicting non-zero/non-target values elsewhere in that area (allows 0s but blocks other numbers).
 * v_map assigns seed-to-pattern and target color (e.g., seed 1 draws type B with color 1; seed 7 draws type C with color 7).
 * Output starts as all 0s; drawings overwrite with the target color, but type C detection uses input values directly.
 * Subtlety: Overlapping drawings aren't handled (last draw wins), but isolation check prevents drawing on conflicts.
 * Grid is typically 20x20 based on output; empty areas (all 0s) remain 0 in output.
 * Easy to miss: Type C detection checks corners and inner fill specifically, but inner is 1<=i<size-1 and 1<=j<size-1 (3x3 inner), while edges only corners—mismatches return False.
 * Isolation counts exact seed occurrences (must be exactly 1) and flags any non-zero/non-target in non-seed positions.
 * No rotation or mirroring; patterns are axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Seeds like 7 and 8 both map to type C with target 7, suggesting synonyms or variants.
 * Program order matters: Draw complete type C first (full patterns), then isolated seeds (avoids partial overwrites).

def draw_type_b(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws hollow with inner top/bottom: excludes corners on top/bottom.

def draw_type_c(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:

    # Essential for complete patterns and seeds 7/8.

def draw_step(grid: List[List[int]], start_r: int, start_c: int, color: int, size: int = 4) -> None:
    # Draws half-left top, half-right bottom: staircase effect.
    # Used for seed 5 to color 6.

def detect_type_c(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Scans 4x4 for exact type C: value in corners and full 3x3 inner.
    # Critical for identifying complete patterns without seeds.

def is_isolated_seed(g: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, v: int, target: int, size: int = 4) -> bool:
    # Checks single seed occurrence and no conflicts (only 0 or target allowed elsewhere).
    # Prevents drawing over existing non-matching patterns.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior iterations provided, but it builds on pattern detection logic.
 * Successfully handles training examples 1-4 fully (all correct), indicating solid base for seed mapping, isolation, and type C detection.
 * v_map and draw_dict are well-structured for extensibility (easy to add new seeds/types).
 * detect_type_c works precisely for complete patterns, avoiding false positives on partials.
 * is_isolated_seed correctly enforces single seed and no conflicts, which likely passed trainings.
 * draw functions are boundary-safe (check grid size), preventing crashes.
 * Program flow (init output, draw C first, then seeds) avoids overwriting complete patterns.
 * Potential issue: Step function assumes even size (half=2), but untested on odd sizes (not relevant here).
 * No extraction of full objects (e.g., no blob finding); relies on top-left scanning, which works but may miss if seeds aren't top-left.
 * Unhelpful: No function for merging overlaps or resolving conflicts beyond isolation check—could lead to incomplete fills if patterns adjoin.
 * The detection for type C expects uniform value v in specific positions but sets expected=0 elsewhere (edges middles), which is correct but subtle—easy to miss that non-corner edges are 0.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 4x4-ish clusters of 7's forming outline-like patterns (e.g., rows 1-4, cols 0-3: alternating 7/0 suggesting type C or B), with isolated extensions in lower sections (e.g., rows 5-8 have partial fills, rows 9-12 show sparser 7's).
 * It appears to have drawn several type C patterns (using 7 as color, matching v_map for seeds 7/8) in upper-left (e.g., positions like (1,0)-(4,3)), mid (around cols 7-10), and right (cols 16-19), plus some isolated seeds triggering more 7's lower down (e.g., row 9 col 0 starts a pattern).
 * Bottom rows (17-19) are all 0s, and top row 0 all 0s, suggesting no seeds/patterns there—makes sense if input has empty borders.
 * However, some areas look incomplete or asymmetric: e.g., row 5 has 7's at cols 0,3-4,7,19 but gaps (cols 8-16 mostly 0 except col 16), unlike uniform 4x4 blocks; row 9 has irregular 7's (e.g., col 4=0 instead of filled), hinting at partial draws or missed isolation.
 * Compared to expected: Assuming test input has scattered 7/8 seeds and some full type C, output should fully expand all isolated ones to 7-filled shapes without gaps; here, patterns like rows 1-4 cols 0-19 repeat every 5 cols (7 0 0 7 7 pattern), which matches type C drawing but skips some inners—possibly correct if input has partials, but likely misses step or other types (no evidence of color 1/4/6, only 7's, so v_map filtering worked but test may need more seed types).
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense (symmetric repeats suggest repeated type C detections), but appears incomplete in lower half (e.g., rows 13-16 have sparser 7's, like row 13: 7 0 0 7 0... with breaks), differing from expected full 4x4 expansions—possibly due to failed isolation checks on clustered seeds, or input has conflicts not handled; unknown why no other colors (1,4,6) appear, suggesting test input lacks those seeds or isolation failed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid-based pattern recognition and expansion system, where the program must identify "seeds" (specific numbers like 1,2,3,5,7,8) and complete patterns (especially type C, which are filled squares) in an input grid, then output a new grid with those seeds expanded into full shapes (frames, inner frames, filled areas, or step/L-shapes) using predefined drawing rules and colors/targets, while ensuring isolation and avoiding overlaps or conflicts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are 4x4 by default (size=4), but some like 'step' use size=6 in the v_map; boundaries must be checked to avoid out-of-grid errors (e.g., if start_r + size > n or start_c + size > m).
 * Processing order is critical: First detect and draw complete type C patterns (filled 4x4 squares with corners and inner 2x2 filled, borders empty) across the entire grid to handle pre-existing full shapes before seeds.
 * Seeds must be "isolated": Only expand if exactly one cell matches the seed value in the 4x4 (or size) area, and no conflicting non-zero/non-target values elsewhere in that area (except the seed itself at (0,0) relative).
 * v_map assigns types and target colors: 1->type B size1 color1 (minimal inner frame?), 2->A size4 color4 (full frame), 3->B size1 color1, 5->step size6 color6 (L-shape split at half), 7->C size? color7 (filled), 8->C size? color7; missing mappings (e.g., 4,6,9) imply no action.
 * Drawing functions overwrite output grid cells with the target color, but input grid may have mixed values; output starts as all zeros, so no preservation of input except via expansion.
 * Type A: Full frame (top/bottom full rows, sides on middles).
 * Type B: Hollow inner (top/bottom partial inner rows, sides full).
 * Type C: Corners on top/bottom, full inner rows on middles (like a filled square with border empty? Wait, detection expects corners and inner filled, but drawing does corners + inner fill).
 * Step: Upper-left half filled in top half rows, lower-right half in bottom half rows (diagonal split L).
 * Subtlety: Detection for type C checks exact match (value v at corners/inner, 0 elsewhere in 4x4), but drawing fills only specific parts—potential mismatch if input has extras.
 * Isolation check skips (0,0) for conflicts but counts all v matches; if multiple seeds overlap areas, later ones may overwrite or be skipped.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test); loops must handle edges without crashing.
 * No rotation/reflection; patterns are axis-aligned.
 * Potential overlaps: Drawing complete C first avoids double-processing, but isolated seeds might overlap drawn areas (since out is separate, but isolation checks input g).
 * Easy to miss: Size=1 for some B types might just be single cells or minimal; step size=6 is larger, could protrude.
 * v_map targets seem arbitrary (e.g., 7->7, but 2->4?); perhaps colors propagate or represent "growth" levels.
 * Unhelpful if detection too strict (e.g., type C requires exact 0s on borders) or if isolation counts wrong (e.g., adjacent seeds count as >1).

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; prior iterations (implied) likely lacked complete type C detection, leading to over-expansion of partial patterns in trainings.
 * Worked well on all 4 training examples by correctly prioritizing full C draws and isolating seeds, avoiding overlaps.
 * v_map and draw_dict integration handled multiple seed types without errors in trainings.
 * Isolation function prevented drawing on clustered seeds, which was key for trainings.
 * detect_type_c is essential and accurate for identifying pre-filled patterns.
 * draw functions are boundary-safe and overwrite correctly on output grid.
 * No major misses in trainings, but potential subtlety: size=1 for B types may not draw anything visible (inner range 1 to 0 empty), which worked if trainings expected no-op.
 * Function draw_type_b may be broken for size=1 (top/bottom: range(2,0) empty; sides only if size>1), but if trainings had no size=1 B, it's fine—don't rely on it for small sizes without fix.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generated a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming frame-like structures (e.g., rows 1-2,4-5 show alternating 7-0 blocks resembling multiple type C or A/B frames starting at columns 0-3,6-9, etc.), plus some partial L/steps lower down (e.g., rows 9-13 have isolated 7s and blocks).
 * It looks partially correct: Consistent with expanding multiple 7-seeds (v_map 7->'c',7) into type C fills (corners + inners), and some step-like in bottom (e.g., row 13 has 7s at ends and middle gaps), assuming input has isolated 7s in those positions.
 * Does not look fully correct: Top row all 0s is expected (no patterns starting row 0?), but middle sections (rows 5-8) have incomplete blocks (e.g., row 5: 7s at 0,3-4,7,19 but gaps at 8-17), suggesting missed or partial draws—possibly overlapping seeds not isolated properly, or type C detection failed on partial input patterns, leading to under-drawing.
 * Bottom half (rows 14-19) mirrors top with more 7-blocks, but row 13 has asymmetric 7s (e.g., positions 0,3,8,11,16,19), which might be step draws (size=6?) but looks jagged—different from expected smooth frames if input has clean seeds.
 * Overall, output makes sense for scattered 7-seeds but likely incorrect in density: Too many isolated 7-blocks without full fills, implying is_isolated_seed rejected some due to conflicts (e.g., adjacent non-7s treated as conflicting), or v_map missing handling for clustered 7s that should merge into larger C.
 * Unknown why row 0 is all 0s while row 1 starts patterns—perhaps no seeds in row 0, but if input has edge seeds, draw functions clip correctly.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid with seed values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that trigger drawing specific shapes (types A, B, C, or "step") in an output grid, using predefined target colors, while ensuring seeds are isolated; additionally, complete type C shapes already present in the input are detected and redrawn in the output with their original value.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are always size 4x4 and must fit within grid bounds; drawing functions clip if they exceed bounds.
 * Isolation check for seeds: exactly one cell with the seed value in the 4x4 area, no conflicting non-zero values except possibly the target in the top-left (but not elsewhere).
 * Type A: Full top/bottom rows, vertical sides on middle rows (like a thick 'U' or block with open middle).
 * Type B: Hollow top/bottom (inner parts only), vertical sides on middle rows (like a frame missing corners).
 * Type C: Top/bottom only corners, middle rows fill inner horizontal (positions 1-2 for size=4), creating a specific partial border; detection requires exact match to this pattern in input, including zeros in non-shape positions.
 * Step: Upper half fills left half, lower half fills right half (like a diagonal step or L-shape fill).
 * Seeds map to types/targets: 2->A/4, 3->B/1, 5->step/6, 7/8->C/7; non-mapped values ignored.
 * After seed-based drawing, scan entire input for complete type C shapes and overlay them in output (can override prior draws).
 * Subtlety: Type C detection is strict—must match exact pattern with zeros elsewhere in 4x4; easy to miss that it only fills horizontals in middle rows, not full borders.
 * Overdrawing possible: Seed draws first, then complete type C overlays; targets may conflict if multiple shapes overlap.
 * Grid is n x m, but examples suggest square or rectangular; empty cells are 0.
 * Isolation fails if seed count >1 in 4x4 or any non-zero non-target in non-origin positions.
 * No rotation or scaling; shapes axis-aligned from seed top-left.
 * Type C completion runs last, so it can "fix" or add detected shapes even without seeds.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) correctly handled all 4 training examples, drawing appropriate shapes from isolated seeds and overlaying detected type C.
 * Isolation logic worked well for training, preventing draws on non-isolated seeds.
 * Type C detection and overlay succeeded in training, as it matched expected patterns.
 * Seed mapping and bound clipping were accurate for training grids.
 * No misses in training, but potential subtlety: the code allows target value at origin during isolation check, which might permit partial pre-drawn shapes as valid seeds (worked for training).
 * draw_complete_type_c scans all positions, which is helpful but could cause overlaps if not intended (didn't break training).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with patterns of 7s forming vertical/horizontal bars, resembling multiple 'H'-like or block shapes (e.g., rows 1-5 show repeating 7-0-0-7-7 patterns, suggesting clustered type C or step draws).
 * Empty top/bottom rows (all 0s) make sense if no seeds/draws there, and the main pattern spans rows 1-17, fitting a larger composition.
 * Observed effects: Dense 7s in positions like (1,0),(1,3),(1,4),(1,7), etc., creating connected bars; middle sections (rows 5-9) have sparser 7s, possibly from step or partial C.
 * It looks coherent and rule-compliant (e.g., 4x4 blocks of 7s without full fills, matching type C partial borders), but without the test input grid, can't confirm if seeds were isolated or if all detected C were overlaid correctly—potential overdraw if input had overlapping seeds.
 * No obvious errors like out-of-bounds or wrong targets (all non-zero are 7s, matching type C target); patterns align to 4-unit spacing (e.g., every 4-5 columns), suggesting multiple side-by-side shapes.
 * Subtle difference: If test input had type A/B/step seeds, output shows only 7s (type C target), so perhaps test relies heavily on 7/8 seeds or detected C, ignoring others; this matches if training emphasized C.
 * Overall, test output makes sense as a visual puzzle completion (e.g., forming letters/symbols like "HI" or grids), and since training passed perfectly, it likely handles test correctly unless input has non-isolated seeds or complex overlaps not tested in training.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:02:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformation where an input grid contains seed values (e.g., 1,2,3,5,7,8) and potentially complete patterns; the output grid is generated by first detecting and replicating complete "type C" patterns (specific inner frame shapes) using their input color, then expanding isolated single seeds into predefined shapes (outer/inner borders, steps, or type C) with mapped types, colors, and fixed size=4, while ensuring no overlaps or conflicts in the output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Prioritize detection and drawing of complete type C patterns in the input grid first, as they take precedence and use the exact input value as the output color; these must match exactly, including zeros in non-pattern positions within the 4x4 window.
 * Isolated seeds are defined strictly: exactly one occurrence of the seed value in its 4x4 window, with no non-zero values in the window except the seed itself and the upcoming target color (to avoid conflicts from prior drawings).
 * Seed mappings are value-specific: 1 and 3 map to inner border (type B) with color 1; 2 maps to outer border (type A) with color 4; 5 maps to L-shaped step with color 6; 7 and 8 both map to type C with color 7; unknown values like 4,6,9+ are ignored.
 * All drawings clip to grid bounds (n x m, here up to 20x20), but patterns are always size=4 and start from valid positions; overdraws may occur if multiple rules apply, but the program initializes output to zeros and draws in order (C first, then seeds).
 * Subtlety: type C detection requires exact match (no extra non-zeros in the window), and drawing functions for A/B/C/step must precisely follow the pattern geometry (e.g., type C draws corners on top/bottom rows and inner 2 columns on middle rows only; step splits left-half fill on top half rows and right-half on bottom).
 * Scanning order matters: complete C detection scans top-to-bottom, left-to-right before seeds, but seeds scan full grid without position restrictions beyond isolation check; this can lead to seeds being skipped if their window overlaps a detected C.
 * Easy to miss: isolation check allows the target color in the window (for future drawing), but forbids other non-zeros; patterns don't rotate or vary in size; output can have multiple overlapping or adjacent patterns without merging.
 * Grid is 0-initialized in output; input may have noise (non-seed values) that must be ignored unless part of a detected C.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond detection/isolation; all operations are in-place drawing on output grid.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt provided; it successfully passed all 4 training examples by correctly detecting type C patterns and expanding isolated seeds per the mappings.
 * What worked: Complete type C detection and drawing is accurate (exact match including zeros); isolation check prevents drawing over conflicts; mappings cover known seeds (1,2,3,5,7,8) with correct types/colors; drawing functions clip properly and follow exact geometries (e.g., type C's inner-only middles).
 * What didn't work: No failures in training, but potential issues in test: seed scanning after C detection may skip seeds whose windows overlap drawn C's (even if not conflicting), as isolation checks input grid only (not output); no handling for seed values outside the map (e.g., if test has 4 or 6 as seeds, they are ignored); overdraws possible if multiple seeds/C's overlap in output, but program allows it (may not match expected if puzzle requires no overdraw).
 * Subtle miss in general: Isolation counts the seed itself but excludes it from conflict check (via (i!=0 or j!=0)), which is correct but easy to bug; no rotation or size variation assumed, which worked for training but may fail if test has variants.
 * No unhelpful functions; all provided (detect, isolate, draws) are essential and correct for the rules; no object extraction needed, as the approach is direct detection/drawing rather than blob analysis.

**Test output:**
 * The test output shows a 20x20 grid with row 0 all zeros, followed by multiple adjacent 4x4 type C patterns drawn in color 7 (e.g., columns 0-3 rows 1-4: corners 7 on top/bottom, inner cols 1-2=7 on middles, with 0s elsewhere; similar for cols 4-7, 8-11, etc., repeating in blocks).
 * Additional partial/incomplete patterns lower down (e.g., rows 5-8 cols 0-3 and 16-19 start as type C but have extra 0s in middles around col8; rows 9-12 show disrupted 7's with many 0s in cols 4-15; rows 13-16 have shifted patterns with 7's in cols 0-3,12-15,16-19; rows 17-20 mirror the top with full type C blocks).
 * This makes sense as correct if the input had multiple isolated 7/8 seeds or complete type C's in those positions, mapped/detected to draw type C with color 7; patterns are isolated without overlaps in the output, and clipping/bounds are handled (no drawing beyond edges).
 * However, it may not be fully correct if the input had step or other types (output is only 7's and 0's, no 1,4,6 seen, suggesting test input only had 7/8 or C's); the disruptions in middle rows (e.g., row5 cols8-15 all 0s) look like skipped seeds due to non-isolation (overlaps or conflicts), which matches the program's logic but could differ from expected if puzzle requires drawing despite minor overlaps or different priority.
 * Overall, the output looks patterned and consistent with rules (no random noise, all 7's form valid type C shapes), but without the exact test input grid, it's hard to verify if all possible seeds were expanded or if some C's were missed; the all-0 row0 suggests no patterns starting at r=0.
