=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:02:20] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def place_vertical_inner(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, color: int) -> None:
    size = 4
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0])
    # top sides
    if r < h and c < w:
        grid[r][c] = color
    if r < h and c + 3 < w:
        grid[r][c + 3] = color
    # middle full inner
    if r + 1 < h and c + 1 < w:
        grid[r + 1][c + 1] = color
    if r + 1 < h and c + 2 < w:
        grid[r + 1][c + 2] = color

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:19:05] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or generation, where input grids contain "seeds" or partial structures represented by numbers (colors like 1, 4, 6, 7, possibly others), and the output requires placing or expanding specific shapes (e.g., hollow rectangles, vertical/horizontal bars, or connected components) in the correct color to match expected patterns, while preserving or copying certain existing elements. The rules likely involve detecting seed positions and orientations to "grow" symmetric or structured forms without overwriting unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs are color-specific: e.g., 4's form compact 4x4 hollow squares or rectangles (rows 1-4 and 6-9 in example 1; rows 1-4 and 5-8 in example 2), 6's form irregular or L-shaped connected groups (e.g., rows 12-15 in example 1), and 1's form sparse cross-like or dotted structures (e.g., rows 16-19 in example 1; rows 2-5 and 6-9 in example 2).
 * Existing patterns must be copied or preserved: e.g., 7's in example 4 expected are retained in specific positions (like vertical bars in columns 13-20), but the program only copies 7's while ignoring others like 4's, 6's, 1's.
 * Seeds seem to trigger shape placement: Expected outputs suggest seeds (possibly marked by certain numbers or positions) expand into fixed shapes, such as vertical/hollow rectangles spanning 4 rows/columns, but oriented horizontally or vertically based on input (e.g., example 3 has right-aligned 4's in columns 6-10).
 * Subtle overlaps and non-overwriting: New placements don't overwrite existing non-zero cells (e.g., in example 4, 7's integrate with 4's and 6's without conflict); grids are 20x20 or 10x10, with empty borders (all 0's in outer rows/columns).
 * Multi-pattern handling: Outputs combine multiple independent shapes (e.g., example 1 has stacked 4's, then 1+6 hybrids, then more 4's); vertical vs. horizontal orientation matters (e.g., example 2 rotates patterns 90 degrees compared to example 3).
 * No overwriting zeros only: Placements fill 0's but respect existing colors; all examples have mostly 0's in generated but dense patterns in expected.
 * Scale and positioning: Shapes are consistently 4 units high/wide (e.g., top/bottom bars in 4's), starting from seed positions; example 4 shows complex interleaving across the full 20x20 grid.
 * Edge cases: Empty inputs produce all 0's (but example 1 generated all 0's incorrectly when expecting patterns); smaller 10x10 grids (examples 2-3) vs. 20x20 (1 and 4) require same logic without hardcoding size.
 * Potential seed detection: Inputs likely have seeds like isolated numbers or partial outlines, but program assumes 8's (not present in shown expecteds), leading to no placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions (place_vertical_inner, copy_existing_patterns, place_for_seeds) are partially helpful for shape placement and copying but broken for this puzzle: place_vertical_inner hardcodes a 4x4 hollow vertical pattern with color 7, which doesn't match multi-color or horizontal needs; copy_existing_patterns only handles 7's, ignoring other colors; place_for_seeds assumes 8's as seeds, but examples use 1/4/6/7. No extraction functions were provided, but a hypothetical one for detecting seeds/objects would be essential.

```python
# Hypothetical helpful function: Detects connected components (blobs) by color and extracts bounding box/orientation for shape expansion.
# Not implemented in attempt, but could identify seeds like isolated 1's or partial 4-rectangles.
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import defaultdict

def extract_patterns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:  # color -> list of (row_start, col_start, orientation: 'v' or 'h')

    patterns = defaultdict(list)
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    directions = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]  # For flood fill to find connected components
    
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = grid[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                
                if component:  # Determine bounding box and orientation (e.g., taller than wide -> vertical)
                    rows = [r for r, c in component]
                    cols = [c for r, c in component]
                    r_start, r_end = min(rows), max(rows)
                    c_start, c_end = min(cols), max(cols)
                    height, width = r_end - r_start + 1, c_end - c_start + 1
                    orient = 'v' if height > width else 'h'
                    patterns[color].append((r_start, c_start, orient))
    
    return patterns
```

```python
# Extension: Place shape based on extracted pattern (e.g., expand to 4x4 hollow for color 4).
def place_pattern(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, color: int, orient: str, size: int = 4) -> None:
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if orient == 'v':
        # Place vertical hollow rectangle, skipping if out of bounds or non-zero
        for dr in range(size):
            for dc in [0, size-1]:  # Sides
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                    grid[nr][nc] = color
            if dr in [1, 2]:  # Inner for middle rows, but adjust for hollow
                for dc in range(1, size-1):
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                        grid[nr][nc] = color
    elif orient == 'h':
        # Similar but horizontal
        pass  # Implement rotation
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed (INCORRECT), producing mostly all-0 grids or partial 7-only patterns, while expecteds have multi-color shapes (4's as hollow rectangles, 1's as crosses, 6's as connected groups, 7's preserved).
 * Training example 1: Generated all 0's (no placements), but expected stacked vertical 4-rectangles (rows 1-4,6-9), a 1+6 hybrid (rows 12-15,16-19); missed seed detection entirely, assuming non-existent 8's.
 * Training example 2: Generated all 0's, but expected rotated/mirrored 1 and 4 patterns (horizontal bars in rows 2-5 for 1's/4's, vertical in 6-9); program copied nothing since no 7's/8's in input (inferred).
 * Training example 3: Generated all 0's, but expected two 4-rectangles (one vertical right-aligned rows 0-3 cols 6-9, one horizontal bottom rows 6-9 cols 0-3/6-9); failed to handle orientation or position seeds.
 * Training example 4: Generated partial 7's (e.g., vertical bars in cols 12-19 rows 0-3/12-19, but misplaced like row 0: 7's at cols 12,15-16,19), but expected full integration of 4/6/1/7 across 20x20 (e.g., large 4-rects rows 0-3/4-7, 6's in rows 8-11/16-19); copied some 7's correctly but placed extras/overwrote implicitly, ignored other colors.
 * Assumed seeds are 8's for placing 7's only, but examples use varied colors (1,4,6) for different shapes; place_vertical_inner is helpful for vertical hollows but unhelpful for horizontal/orientation (doesn't rotate) or multi-color (hardcodes 7).
 * copy_existing_patterns works for 7's (partial success in example 4) but ignores other colors, leading to incomplete outputs.
 * place_for_seeds is broken/not helpful: Triggers on 8's (absent in examples), places wrong color/shape, doesn't detect connected/oriented seeds.
 * No object extraction, so missed detecting blobs (e.g., partial 4's as seeds); all attempts lack color-specific rules or orientation logic.
 * Function `place_vertical_inner` is partially helpful for vertical 4-unit shapes but broken for horizontal (e.g., example 2) or non-7 colors (don't use as-is; extend for rotation/color).
 * Overall, attempts show basic copying/placement intent but zero understanding of multi-color seeds or shapes, resulting in empty or mono-color outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7's in clustered vertical/horizontal bars (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3/4-7/8-11/12-15/16-19 with 7's on edges/middles; similar in rows 9-12/13-16/17-19), resembling attempted hollow rectangles or ladders, but it does not look correct—it's all 7's (mono-color) in a repetitive grid-wide pattern, ignoring potential multi-color needs from training (e.g., no 4's/1's/6's integration like example 4 expected). This seems over-placed (dense 7's everywhere vs. sparse expecteds) and likely triggered by assumed 8-seed positions not matching real inputs; without expected test grid, it mismatches training patterns (e.g., no empty borders, wrong shapes), suggesting continued failure on seed detection/orientation. It partially "makes sense" as expanded verticals (using place_vertical_inner) but is incorrect due to color/shape mismatches and overgeneration.

[2025-10-02 08:19:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:35:16] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger cells (types 2, 3, 5, or 8) initiate the placement of predefined 4-unit-high pattern shapes (resembling tetromino-like or frame structures) that fill adjacent cells with a corresponding color (4 for type 2, 1 for 3, 6 for 5, 7 for 8). Placements are processed in row-major order, filling normally if no conflicts with future triggers, but shifting the pattern horizontally by the row delta to an alternative column if conflicts arise, ensuring no overlaps across all triggers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other cell values are ignored and do not trigger fills.
 * Each trigger places a 4x4 bounding box pattern: type 2 fills top/bottom rows fully and left/right edges in middle rows (like a hollow rectangle); type 3 fills middle two columns in top/bottom and left/right edges in middle rows (like a narrow frame); type 5 fills top-left 2x2 and bottom-right 2x2 (diagonal blocks); type 8 fills corners of the 4x4 and middle two columns in middle rows (like an X or cross frame).
 * Patterns must fit within grid bounds (n x n); if a placement (normal or shifted) would go out of bounds, it is skipped.
 * Conflicts are checked only against future triggers (not past ones), using set intersection of fill cells; if any overlap, attempt a single horizontal shift by the row difference (delta = future_trigger_row - current_row) to new column c + delta, and verify the alternative fill against ALL other normal fills (not just futures).
 * If a valid non-conflicting placement (normal or shifted) is found, apply it immediately; otherwise, skip the trigger entirely—no partial or multiple shift attempts.
 * Grid is square (n x n), output initializes to 0s, and multiple triggers can fill the same cell only if no conflicts were detected during placement (but the conflict check prevents this).
 * Subtlety: Shifting is always to the right (c + delta, where delta > 0 since futures are later rows), and only one shift per conflicting future (tries futures in order, stops at first valid shift).
 * Easy to miss: Normal fills are precomputed for all triggers upfront, but shifts are computed on-the-fly and checked against all precomputed normal fills (not shifted ones), assuming no chains of shifts.
 * Colors override previous fills if they happen (but conflict avoidance should prevent this); no blending or priority beyond order.
 * Empty grid or no triggers results in all-0 output; triggers are sorted row-major for processing.
 * Bounds check for shifts: alt_c must allow a full 4-wide pattern (alt_c >=0 and alt_c+3 < n).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_color(typ: int) -> int:
    mapping = {2: 4, 3: 1, 5: 6, 8: 7}
    return mapping.get(typ, 0)
```
(This maps trigger types to fill colors; essential and correct, as output uses these values.)

```python
def get_fill(r: int, c: int, typ: int, n: int) -> set:
    if r + 3 >= n or c + 3 >= n or c < 0:
        return set()
    fill = set()
    if typ == 2:
        for dc in range(4):
            fill.add((r, c + dc))
            fill.add((r + 3, c + dc))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 3:
        fill.add((r, c + 1))
        fill.add((r, c + 2))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 1))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 2))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 5:
        for dr in range(2):
            for dc in range(2):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
        for dr in range(2, 4):
            for dc in range(2, 4):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
    elif typ == 8:
        fill.add((r, c))
        fill.add((r, c + 3))
        fill.add((r + 3, c))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 3))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 1))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 2))
    return fill
```
(This defines the exact pattern fills for each type, relative to (r,c) top-left; critical for accurate placement, handles bounds, and uses sets for efficient overlap checks; appears correct based on training success.)

(The main program function integrates these, collects/sorts triggers, precomputes normal fills, and handles conflict resolution with shifts; useful but has a flaw in shift validation—see below.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of trigger collection, pattern filling, ordering, and basic conflict avoidance.
 * Worked: Precomputing normal fills and checking future conflicts correctly avoided overlaps in training cases; color mapping and pattern definitions matched expected shapes; skipping invalid bounds prevented errors.
 * Did not work: In the test case, the shift logic only tries alternatives against future conflicts but validates shifted fills against all normal fills (including past and non-conflicting futures), which may over-reject valid shifts if earlier triggers' normal fills block the shift (even if those earlier ones might have shifted themselves—code doesn't handle chained shifts).
 * Missed: No handling for multiple conflicting futures requiring different shifts; code stops at the first future-conflicting jj and tries only that delta, potentially missing better shifts for later conflicts.
 * extract_triggers logic (via loops and sorting) is essential and worked well for identifying and ordering triggers.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_color, get_fill, main program) are relevant, though the conflict resolution in main could be refined for recursive or multi-shift checks.
 * Training mismatches: None reported—all correct, suggesting patterns and colors align, but subtleties like shift deltas may not have been tested in training.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with mostly 0s, filled only with 7s (indicating only type 8 triggers present, no 2/3/5), forming repeating vertical patterns of what appear to be shifted or normal type 8 shapes (corners + middle columns) in columns like 0-3, 3-6? Wait, looking at row 1: 7s at indices 0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19—suggesting overlapping or adjacent 4-wide fills starting at c=0,3?, but 3-6 would be 3,4,5,6 (only 3,4 have 7s, missing 5,6?), inconsistent with full type 8 pattern.
 * Patterns emerge in blocks: rows 1-4 show staggered 7s resembling partial frames (e.g., row1/4: edges, row2/3: middles), repeating every 4 columns but shifted; rows 5-8 similar but sparser; rows 9-12 have denser fills including some inner 7s (e.g., row9: 7 at 0,3,7,11,15,19 and extras); rows 13-16 vary with more 0s in middles; rows 17+ all 0s—suggests triggers mostly in upper/mid rows, with shifts pushing some patterns rightward or skipping lower ones.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should have clean, non-overlapping type 8 patterns (4-high, with exactly 4 corners + 4 middle fills per shape=8 cells per trigger), but observed 7s show irregularities like missing middle fills in some potential shapes (e.g., row1 cols 0-3: only 0 and 3 filled, no c+1/c+2), and apparent overlaps or partial fills (e.g., row9 col4=0 but adjacent patterns suggest conflict not resolved). Top/bottom rows (0,18-19) all 0s make sense if no triggers there, but the density and staggering imply unresolved multi-conflicts where shifts failed validation against all normal fills, leading to skipped triggers—likely why it's different from expected (more complete coverage without gaps in patterns). Unknown exact input, but output lacks symmetry expected for type 8 (e.g., no full vertical alignment), suggesting shift logic over-constrains and skips valid placements.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:35:16] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or generation, where input grids contain "seeds" or partial structures represented by numbers (colors like 1, 4, 6, 7, possibly others), and the output requires placing or expanding specific shapes (e.g., hollow rectangles, vertical/horizontal bars, or connected components) in the correct color to match expected patterns, while preserving or copying certain existing elements. The rules likely involve detecting seed positions and orientations to "grow" symmetric or structured forms without overwriting unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs are color-specific: e.g., 4's form compact 4x4 hollow squares or rectangles (rows 1-4 and 6-9 in example 1; rows 1-4 and 5-8 in example 2), 6's form irregular or L-shaped connected groups (e.g., rows 12-15 in example 1), and 1's form sparse cross-like or dotted structures (e.g., rows 16-19 in example 1; rows 2-5 and 6-9 in example 2).
 * Existing patterns must be copied or preserved: e.g., 7's in example 4 expected are retained in specific positions (like vertical bars in columns 13-20), but the program only copies 7's while ignoring others like 4's, 6's, 1's.
 * Seeds seem to trigger shape placement: Expected outputs suggest seeds (possibly marked by certain numbers or positions) expand into fixed shapes, such as vertical/hollow rectangles spanning 4 rows/columns, but oriented horizontally or vertically based on input (e.g., example 3 has right-aligned 4's in columns 6-10).
 * Subtle overlaps and non-overwriting: New placements don't overwrite existing non-zero cells (e.g., in example 4, 7's integrate with 4's and 6's without conflict); grids are 20x20 or 10x10, with empty borders (all 0's in outer rows/columns).
 * Multi-pattern handling: Outputs combine multiple independent shapes (e.g., example 1 has stacked 4's, then 1+6 hybrids, then more 4's); vertical vs. horizontal orientation matters (e.g., example 2 rotates patterns 90 degrees compared to example 3).
 * No overwriting zeros only: Placements fill 0's but respect existing colors; all examples have mostly 0's in generated but dense patterns in expected.
 * Scale and positioning: Shapes are consistently 4 units high/wide (e.g., top/bottom bars in 4's), starting from seed positions; example 4 shows complex interleaving across the full 20x20 grid.
 * Edge cases: Empty inputs produce all 0's (but example 1 generated all 0's incorrectly when expecting patterns); smaller 10x10 grids (examples 2-3) vs. 20x20 (1 and 4) require same logic without hardcoding size.
 * Potential seed detection: Inputs likely have seeds like isolated numbers or partial outlines, but program assumes 8's (not present in shown expecteds), leading to no placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions (place_vertical_inner, copy_existing_patterns, place_for_seeds) are partially helpful for shape placement and copying but broken for this puzzle: place_vertical_inner hardcodes a 4x4 hollow vertical pattern with color 7, which doesn't match multi-color or horizontal needs; copy_existing_patterns only handles 7's, ignoring other colors; place_for_seeds assumes 8's as seeds, but examples use 1/4/6/7. No extraction functions were provided, but a hypothetical one for detecting seeds/objects would be essential.

```python
# Hypothetical helpful function: Detects connected components (blobs) by color and extracts bounding box/orientation for shape expansion.
# Not implemented in attempt, but could identify seeds like isolated 1's or partial 4-rectangles.
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import defaultdict

def extract_patterns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:  # color -> list of (row_start, col_start, orientation: 'v' or 'h')
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    patterns = defaultdict(list)
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    directions = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]  # For flood fill to find connected components
    
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = grid[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                
                if component:  # Determine bounding box and orientation (e.g., taller than wide -> vertical)
                    rows = [r for r, c in component]
                    cols = [c for r, c in component]
                    r_start, r_end = min(rows), max(rows)
                    c_start, c_end = min(cols), max(cols)
                    height, width = r_end - r_start + 1, c_end - c_start + 1
                    orient = 'v' if height > width else 'h'
                    patterns[color].append((r_start, c_start, orient))
    
    return patterns
```

```python
# Extension: Place shape based on extracted pattern (e.g., expand to 4x4 hollow for color 4).
def place_pattern(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, color: int, orient: str, size: int = 4) -> None:
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if orient == 'v':
        # Place vertical hollow rectangle, skipping if out of bounds or non-zero
        for dr in range(size):
            for dc in [0, size-1]:  # Sides
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                    grid[nr][nc] = color
            if dr in [1, 2]:  # Inner for middle rows, but adjust for hollow
                for dc in range(1, size-1):
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                        grid[nr][nc] = color
    elif orient == 'h':
        # Similar but horizontal
        pass  # Implement rotation
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed (INCORRECT), producing mostly all-0 grids or partial 7-only patterns, while expecteds have multi-color shapes (4's as hollow rectangles, 1's as crosses, 6's as connected groups, 7's preserved).
 * Training example 1: Generated all 0's (no placements), but expected stacked vertical 4-rectangles (rows 1-4,6-9), a 1+6 hybrid (rows 12-15,16-19); missed seed detection entirely, assuming non-existent 8's.
 * Training example 2: Generated all 0's, but expected rotated/mirrored 1 and 4 patterns (horizontal bars in rows 2-5 for 1's/4's, vertical in 6-9); program copied nothing since no 7's/8's in input (inferred).
 * Training example 3: Generated all 0's, but expected two 4-rectangles (one vertical right-aligned rows 0-3 cols 6-9, one horizontal bottom rows 6-9 cols 0-3/6-9); failed to handle orientation or position seeds.
 * Training example 4: Generated partial 7's (e.g., vertical bars in cols 12-19 rows 0-3/12-19, but misplaced like row 0: 7's at cols 12,15-16,19), but expected full integration of 4/6/1/7 across 20x20 (e.g., large 4-rects rows 0-3/4-7, 6's in rows 8-11/16-19); copied some 7's correctly but placed extras/overwrote implicitly, ignored other colors.
 * Assumed seeds are 8's for placing 7's only, but examples use varied colors (1,4,6) for different shapes; place_vertical_inner is helpful for vertical hollows but unhelpful for horizontal/orientation (doesn't rotate) or multi-color (hardcodes 7).
 * copy_existing_patterns works for 7's (partial success in example 4) but ignores other colors, leading to incomplete outputs.
 * place_for_seeds is broken/not helpful: Triggers on 8's (absent in examples), places wrong color/shape, doesn't detect connected/oriented seeds.
 * No object extraction, so missed detecting blobs (e.g., partial 4's as seeds); all attempts lack color-specific rules or orientation logic.
 * Function `place_vertical_inner` is partially helpful for vertical 4-unit shapes but broken for horizontal (e.g., example 2) or non-7 colors (don't use as-is; extend for rotation/color).
 * Overall, attempts show basic copying/placement intent but zero understanding of multi-color seeds or shapes, resulting in empty or mono-color outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7's in clustered vertical/horizontal bars (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3/4-7/8-11/12-15/16-19 with 7's on edges/middles; similar in rows 9-12/13-16/17-19), resembling attempted hollow rectangles or ladders, but it does not look correct—it's all 7's (mono-color) in a repetitive grid-wide pattern, ignoring potential multi-color needs from training (e.g., no 4's/1's/6's integration like example 4 expected). This seems over-placed (dense 7's everywhere vs. sparse expecteds) and likely triggered by assumed 8-seed positions not matching real inputs; without expected test grid, it mismatches training patterns (e.g., no empty borders, wrong shapes), suggesting continued failure on seed detection/orientation. It partially "makes sense" as expanded verticals (using place_vertical_inner) but is incorrect due to color/shape mismatches and overgeneration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger cells (types 2, 3, 5, or 8) initiate the placement of predefined 4-unit-high pattern shapes (resembling tetromino-like or frame structures) that fill adjacent cells with a corresponding color (4 for type 2, 1 for 3, 6 for 5, 7 for 8). Placements are processed in row-major order, filling normally if no conflicts with future triggers, but shifting the pattern horizontally by the row delta to an alternative column if conflicts arise, ensuring no overlaps across all triggers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other cell values are ignored and do not trigger fills.
 * Each trigger places a 4x4 bounding box pattern: type 2 fills top/bottom rows fully and left/right edges in middle rows (like a hollow rectangle); type 3 fills middle two columns in top/bottom and left/right edges in middle rows (like a narrow frame); type 5 fills top-left 2x2 and bottom-right 2x2 (diagonal blocks); type 8 fills corners of the 4x4 and middle two columns in middle rows (like an X or cross frame).
 * Patterns must fit within grid bounds (n x n); if a placement (normal or shifted) would go out of bounds, it is skipped.
 * Conflicts are checked only against future triggers (not past ones), using set intersection of fill cells; if any overlap, attempt a single horizontal shift by the row difference (delta = future_trigger_row - current_row) to new column c + delta, and verify the alternative fill against ALL other normal fills (not just futures).
 * If a valid non-conflicting placement (normal or shifted) is found, apply it immediately; otherwise, skip the trigger entirely—no partial or multiple shift attempts.
 * Grid is square (n x n), output initializes to 0s, and multiple triggers can fill the same cell only if no conflicts were detected during placement (but the conflict check prevents this).
 * Subtlety: Shifting is always to the right (c + delta, where delta > 0 since futures are later rows), and only one shift per conflicting future (tries futures in order, stops at first valid shift).
 * Easy to miss: Normal fills are precomputed for all triggers upfront, but shifts are computed on-the-fly and checked against all precomputed normal fills (not shifted ones), assuming no chains of shifts.
 * Colors override previous fills if they happen (but conflict avoidance should prevent this); no blending or priority beyond order.
 * Empty grid or no triggers results in all-0 output; triggers are sorted row-major for processing.
 * Bounds check for shifts: alt_c must allow a full 4-wide pattern (alt_c >=0 and alt_c+3 < n).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_color(typ: int) -> int:
    mapping = {2: 4, 3: 1, 5: 6, 8: 7}
    return mapping.get(typ, 0)
```
(This maps trigger types to fill colors; essential and correct, as output uses these values.)

```python
def get_fill(r: int, c: int, typ: int, n: int) -> set:
    if r + 3 >= n or c + 3 >= n or c < 0:
        return set()
    fill = set()
    if typ == 2:
        for dc in range(4):
            fill.add((r, c + dc))
            fill.add((r + 3, c + dc))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 3:
        fill.add((r, c + 1))
        fill.add((r, c + 2))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 1))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 2))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 5:
        for dr in range(2):
            for dc in range(2):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
        for dr in range(2, 4):
            for dc in range(2, 4):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
    elif typ == 8:
        fill.add((r, c))
        fill.add((r, c + 3))
        fill.add((r + 3, c))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 3))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 1))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 2))
    return fill
```
(This defines the exact pattern fills for each type, relative to (r,c) top-left; critical for accurate placement, handles bounds, and uses sets for efficient overlap checks; appears correct based on training success.)

(The main program function integrates these, collects/sorts triggers, precomputes normal fills, and handles conflict resolution with shifts; useful but has a flaw in shift validation—see below.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of trigger collection, pattern filling, ordering, and basic conflict avoidance.
 * Worked: Precomputing normal fills and checking future conflicts correctly avoided overlaps in training cases; color mapping and pattern definitions matched expected shapes; skipping invalid bounds prevented errors.
 * Did not work: In the test case, the shift logic only tries alternatives against future conflicts but validates shifted fills against all normal fills (including past and non-conflicting futures), which may over-reject valid shifts if earlier triggers' normal fills block the shift (even if those earlier ones might have shifted themselves—code doesn't handle chained shifts).
 * Missed: No handling for multiple conflicting futures requiring different shifts; code stops at the first future-conflicting jj and tries only that delta, potentially missing better shifts for later conflicts.
 * extract_triggers logic (via loops and sorting) is essential and worked well for identifying and ordering triggers.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_color, get_fill, main program) are relevant, though the conflict resolution in main could be refined for recursive or multi-shift checks.
 * Training mismatches: None reported—all correct, suggesting patterns and colors align, but subtleties like shift deltas may not have been tested in training.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with mostly 0s, filled only with 7s (indicating only type 8 triggers present, no 2/3/5), forming repeating vertical patterns of what appear to be shifted or normal type 8 shapes (corners + middle columns) in columns like 0-3, 3-6? Wait, looking at row 1: 7s at indices 0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19—suggesting overlapping or adjacent 4-wide fills starting at c=0,3?, but 3-6 would be 3,4,5,6 (only 3,4 have 7s, missing 5,6?), inconsistent with full type 8 pattern.
 * Patterns emerge in blocks: rows 1-4 show staggered 7s resembling partial frames (e.g., row1/4: edges, row2/3: middles), repeating every 4 columns but shifted; rows 5-8 similar but sparser; rows 9-12 have denser fills including some inner 7s (e.g., row9: 7 at 0,3,7,11,15,19 and extras); rows 13-16 vary with more 0s in middles; rows 17+ all 0s—suggests triggers mostly in upper/mid rows, with shifts pushing some patterns rightward or skipping lower ones.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should have clean, non-overlapping type 8 patterns (4-high, with exactly 4 corners + 4 middle fills per shape=8 cells per trigger), but observed 7s show irregularities like missing middle fills in some potential shapes (e.g., row1 cols 0-3: only 0 and 3 filled, no c+1/c+2), and apparent overlaps or partial fills (e.g., row9 col4=0 but adjacent patterns suggest conflict not resolved). Top/bottom rows (0,18-19) all 0s make sense if no triggers there, but the density and staggering imply unresolved multi-conflicts where shifts failed validation against all normal fills, leading to skipped triggers—likely why it's different from expected (more complete coverage without gaps in patterns). Unknown exact input, but output lacks symmetry expected for type 8 (e.g., no full vertical alignment), suggesting shift logic over-constrains and skips valid placements.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:42:14] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where specific "trigger" cells (values 2, 3, 5, or 8) in an input grid dictate the placement of colored shapes (fills) into an output grid, following predefined patterns for each type. The challenge involves placing these shapes without overlaps, prioritizing non-conflicting positions, and shifting them horizontally by row deltas if needed to resolve future conflicts, while ensuring the output is a fully colored grid matching some expected pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other values are ignored, and each maps to a specific color (2->4, 3->1, 5->6, 8->7).
 * Shapes are 4x4 bounding boxes but with sparse fills: type 2 is a hollow rectangle (top/bottom/full rows, sides on middle); type 3 is similar but inner top/bottom partial; type 5 is two diagonal 2x2 blocks; type 8 is corners plus inner top/bottom partial.
 * Process triggers in row-major order (sorted by r, then c); for each, attempt normal placement (no shift); if it intersects already-placed fills or future triggers' fills, compute conflicting row deltas and try shifting the column by those deltas to find a non-overlapping spot.
 * Subtlety: Shifts are only horizontal (column offset by delta = future_r - current_r), and only if the shifted position doesn't go out of bounds or intersect placed/future fills; if no valid placement (normal or shifted), skip the trigger entirely.
 * Easy to miss: Future conflict checks use set intersection of fills, but only after sorting triggers; also, invalid positions (e.g., near edges) return empty sets, preventing placement.
 * Output is a grid of colors (non-zero) where fills are placed; zeros remain empty—puzzle likely expects full coverage without gaps or overlaps.
 * Considerations: No vertical shifts; deltas are row differences only; multiple shifts possible but code tries them in sorted order and places only the first valid one; no backtracking if all shifts fail.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def get_color(typ: int) -> int:
    if typ == 2:
        return 4
    if typ == 3:
        return 1
    if typ == 5:
        return 6
    if typ == 8:
        return 7
    return 0
```
(This maps trigger types to output colors; essential for correct filling.)

```python
def get_fill(r: int, c: int, typ: int, n: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if r + 3 >= n or c + 3 >= n or c < 0:
        return set()
    fill: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    if typ == 2:
        for dc in range(4):
            fill.add((r, c + dc))
            fill.add((r + 3, c + dc))
        for dr in (1, 2):
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 3:
        fill.add((r, c + 1))
        fill.add((r, c + 2))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 1))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 2))
        for dr in (1, 2):
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 5:
        for dr in range(2):
            for dc in range(2):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
        for dr in range(2, 4):
            for dc in range(2, 4):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
    elif typ == 8:
        fill.add((r, c))
        fill.add((r, c + 3))
        fill.add((r + 3, c))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 3))
        for dr in (1, 2):
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 1))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 2))
    return fill
```
(This defines exact sparse fill patterns for each type, relative to (r,c); crucial for accurate shape placement and intersection checks. Handles bounds checking early.)

                placed_this = True
                break
    return out_grid
```
(This is the core solver; extracts/sorts triggers, attempts normal then shifted placements, checks intersections with placed and future fills. Helpful but has bugs in shift logic for test case.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/last submission shown; it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid grasp of trigger extraction, sorting, fill patterns, color mapping, and basic non-overlap placement.
 * Worked: Normal placements without conflicts succeed; future delta computation catches some overlaps; skipping invalid bounds prevents errors.
 * Did not work: In test case, many triggers likely skipped due to unresolved conflicts/shifts, leading to incomplete filling; shift logic only tries deltas from conflicting futures but may not explore enough options or handle chained conflicts.
 * Subtle bug: Shifted future intersection check reuses original trigger positions (not shifted), which might miss some overlaps; also, only shifts current trigger, not adjusting futures.
 * No extraction function for full objects beyond triggers; could add one to pre-validate all possible placements.
 * get_fill is accurate and essential; get_color is correct but unused in test output (only 7's appear, suggesting only type 8 placed).
 * No unhelpful functions present; all code is relevant but shift resolution is incomplete/inefficient for complex grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (a 20x20 grid) does not look correct; it shows sparse, repeating patterns of 7's (likely from type 8 triggers) in the top-middle and bottom-middle sections, with large empty areas (rows 0, 17-19 fully zero, and many zeros elsewhere), suggesting many triggers were skipped rather than placed/shifted successfully.
 * Expected: Based on puzzle rules, the output should be a densely filled grid with mixed colors (1,4,6,7) covering most cells without overlaps or large gaps, as training examples passed fully; here, only color 7 appears, and patterns look like isolated 4x4 shapes without full coverage.
 * Differences: Top block (rows 1-4) has a checker-like 7 pattern but incomplete (e.g., row 1: 7 at cols 0,3-4,7-8,... but zeros elsewhere); middle sections (rows 5-16) have partial vertical strips of 7's but asymmetric and gappy (e.g., row 5 has 7's only at ends); bottom empty— this mismatches expected uniform, conflict-resolved filling.
 * Why incorrect: Likely shift logic fails on test's denser trigger layout (20x20 vs. smaller training?), causing cascades of skips; no color variety indicates types 2,3,5 not placed at all; mentally simulating, if test input has overlapping triggers across rows, deltas may push shifts out-of-bounds without alternatives.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:42:14] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or generation, where input grids contain "seeds" or partial structures represented by numbers (colors like 1, 4, 6, 7, possibly others), and the output requires placing or expanding specific shapes (e.g., hollow rectangles, vertical/horizontal bars, or connected components) in the correct color to match expected patterns, while preserving or copying certain existing elements. The rules likely involve detecting seed positions and orientations to "grow" symmetric or structured forms without overwriting unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs are color-specific: e.g., 4's form compact 4x4 hollow squares or rectangles (rows 1-4 and 6-9 in example 1; rows 1-4 and 5-8 in example 2), 6's form irregular or L-shaped connected groups (e.g., rows 12-15 in example 1), and 1's form sparse cross-like or dotted structures (e.g., rows 16-19 in example 1; rows 2-5 and 6-9 in example 2).
 * Existing patterns must be copied or preserved: e.g., 7's in example 4 expected are retained in specific positions (like vertical bars in columns 13-20), but the program only copies 7's while ignoring others like 4's, 6's, 1's.
 * Seeds seem to trigger shape placement: Expected outputs suggest seeds (possibly marked by certain numbers or positions) expand into fixed shapes, such as vertical/hollow rectangles spanning 4 rows/columns, but oriented horizontally or vertically based on input (e.g., example 3 has right-aligned 4's in columns 6-10).
 * Subtle overlaps and non-overwriting: New placements don't overwrite existing non-zero cells (e.g., in example 4, 7's integrate with 4's and 6's without conflict); grids are 20x20 or 10x10, with empty borders (all 0's in outer rows/columns).
 * Multi-pattern handling: Outputs combine multiple independent shapes (e.g., example 1 has stacked 4's, then 1+6 hybrids, then more 4's); vertical vs. horizontal orientation matters (e.g., example 2 rotates patterns 90 degrees compared to example 3).
 * No overwriting zeros only: Placements fill 0's but respect existing colors; all examples have mostly 0's in generated but dense patterns in expected.
 * Scale and positioning: Shapes are consistently 4 units high/wide (e.g., top/bottom bars in 4's), starting from seed positions; example 4 shows complex interleaving across the full 20x20 grid.
 * Edge cases: Empty inputs produce all 0's (but example 1 generated all 0's incorrectly when expecting patterns); smaller 10x10 grids (examples 2-3) vs. 20x20 (1 and 4) require same logic without hardcoding size.
 * Potential seed detection: Inputs likely have seeds like isolated numbers or partial outlines, but program assumes 8's (not present in shown expecteds), leading to no placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions (place_vertical_inner, copy_existing_patterns, place_for_seeds) are partially helpful for shape placement and copying but broken for this puzzle: place_vertical_inner hardcodes a 4x4 hollow vertical pattern with color 7, which doesn't match multi-color or horizontal needs; copy_existing_patterns only handles 7's, ignoring other colors; place_for_seeds assumes 8's as seeds, but examples use 1/4/6/7. No extraction functions were provided, but a hypothetical one for detecting seeds/objects would be essential.

```python
# Hypothetical helpful function: Detects connected components (blobs) by color and extracts bounding box/orientation for shape expansion.
# Not implemented in attempt, but could identify seeds like isolated 1's or partial 4-rectangles.
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

    patterns = defaultdict(list)
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    directions = [(0,1),(1,0),(0,-1),(-1,0)]  # For flood fill to find connected components
    
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = grid[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]
                visited[i][j] = True
                while stack:
                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                
                if component:  # Determine bounding box and orientation (e.g., taller than wide -> vertical)
                    rows = [r for r, c in component]
                    cols = [c for r, c in component]
                    r_start, r_end = min(rows), max(rows)
                    c_start, c_end = min(cols), max(cols)
                    height, width = r_end - r_start + 1, c_end - c_start + 1
                    orient = 'v' if height > width else 'h'
                    patterns[color].append((r_start, c_start, orient))
    
    return patterns
```

```python
# Extension: Place shape based on extracted pattern (e.g., expand to 4x4 hollow for color 4).
def place_pattern(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, color: int, orient: str, size: int = 4) -> None:
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if orient == 'v':
        # Place vertical hollow rectangle, skipping if out of bounds or non-zero
        for dr in range(size):
            for dc in [0, size-1]:  # Sides
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                    grid[nr][nc] = color
            if dr in [1, 2]:  # Inner for middle rows, but adjust for hollow
                for dc in range(1, size-1):
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                        grid[nr][nc] = color
    elif orient == 'h':
        # Similar but horizontal
        pass  # Implement rotation
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed (INCORRECT), producing mostly all-0 grids or partial 7-only patterns, while expecteds have multi-color shapes (4's as hollow rectangles, 1's as crosses, 6's as connected groups, 7's preserved).
 * Training example 1: Generated all 0's (no placements), but expected stacked vertical 4-rectangles (rows 1-4,6-9), a 1+6 hybrid (rows 12-15,16-19); missed seed detection entirely, assuming non-existent 8's.
 * Training example 2: Generated all 0's, but expected rotated/mirrored 1 and 4 patterns (horizontal bars in rows 2-5 for 1's/4's, vertical in 6-9); program copied nothing since no 7's/8's in input (inferred).
 * Training example 3: Generated all 0's, but expected two 4-rectangles (one vertical right-aligned rows 0-3 cols 6-9, one horizontal bottom rows 6-9 cols 0-3/6-9); failed to handle orientation or position seeds.
 * Training example 4: Generated partial 7's (e.g., vertical bars in cols 12-19 rows 0-3/12-19, but misplaced like row 0: 7's at cols 12,15-16,19), but expected full integration of 4/6/1/7 across 20x20 (e.g., large 4-rects rows 0-3/4-7, 6's in rows 8-11/16-19); copied some 7's correctly but placed extras/overwrote implicitly, ignored other colors.
 * Assumed seeds are 8's for placing 7's only, but examples use varied colors (1,4,6) for different shapes; place_vertical_inner is helpful for vertical hollows but unhelpful for horizontal/orientation (doesn't rotate) or multi-color (hardcodes 7).
 * copy_existing_patterns works for 7's (partial success in example 4) but ignores other colors, leading to incomplete outputs.
 * place_for_seeds is broken/not helpful: Triggers on 8's (absent in examples), places wrong color/shape, doesn't detect connected/oriented seeds.
 * No object extraction, so missed detecting blobs (e.g., partial 4's as seeds); all attempts lack color-specific rules or orientation logic.
 * Function `place_vertical_inner` is partially helpful for vertical 4-unit shapes but broken for horizontal (e.g., example 2) or non-7 colors (don't use as-is; extend for rotation/color).
 * Overall, attempts show basic copying/placement intent but zero understanding of multi-color seeds or shapes, resulting in empty or mono-color outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7's in clustered vertical/horizontal bars (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3/4-7/8-11/12-15/16-19 with 7's on edges/middles; similar in rows 9-12/13-16/17-19), resembling attempted hollow rectangles or ladders, but it does not look correct—it's all 7's (mono-color) in a repetitive grid-wide pattern, ignoring potential multi-color needs from training (e.g., no 4's/1's/6's integration like example 4 expected). This seems over-placed (dense 7's everywhere vs. sparse expecteds) and likely triggered by assumed 8-seed positions not matching real inputs; without expected test grid, it mismatches training patterns (e.g., no empty borders, wrong shapes), suggesting continued failure on seed detection/orientation. It partially "makes sense" as expanded verticals (using place_vertical_inner) but is incorrect due to color/shape mismatches and overgeneration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger cells (types 2, 3, 5, or 8) initiate the placement of predefined 4-unit-high pattern shapes (resembling tetromino-like or frame structures) that fill adjacent cells with a corresponding color (4 for type 2, 1 for 3, 6 for 5, 7 for 8). Placements are processed in row-major order, filling normally if no conflicts with future triggers, but shifting the pattern horizontally by the row delta to an alternative column if conflicts arise, ensuring no overlaps across all triggers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other cell values are ignored and do not trigger fills.
 * Each trigger places a 4x4 bounding box pattern: type 2 fills top/bottom rows fully and left/right edges in middle rows (like a hollow rectangle); type 3 fills middle two columns in top/bottom and left/right edges in middle rows (like a narrow frame); type 5 fills top-left 2x2 and bottom-right 2x2 (diagonal blocks); type 8 fills corners of the 4x4 and middle two columns in middle rows (like an X or cross frame).
 * Patterns must fit within grid bounds (n x n); if a placement (normal or shifted) would go out of bounds, it is skipped.
 * Conflicts are checked only against future triggers (not past ones), using set intersection of fill cells; if any overlap, attempt a single horizontal shift by the row difference (delta = future_trigger_row - current_row) to new column c + delta, and verify the alternative fill against ALL other normal fills (not just futures).
 * If a valid non-conflicting placement (normal or shifted) is found, apply it immediately; otherwise, skip the trigger entirely—no partial or multiple shift attempts.
 * Grid is square (n x n), output initializes to 0s, and multiple triggers can fill the same cell only if no conflicts were detected during placement (but the conflict check prevents this).
 * Subtlety: Shifting is always to the right (c + delta, where delta > 0 since futures are later rows), and only one shift per conflicting future (tries futures in order, stops at first valid shift).
 * Easy to miss: Normal fills are precomputed for all triggers upfront, but shifts are computed on-the-fly and checked against all precomputed normal fills (not shifted ones), assuming no chains of shifts.
 * Colors override previous fills if they happen (but conflict avoidance should prevent this); no blending or priority beyond order.
 * Empty grid or no triggers results in all-0 output; triggers are sorted row-major for processing.
 * Bounds check for shifts: alt_c must allow a full 4-wide pattern (alt_c >=0 and alt_c+3 < n).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def get_color(typ: int) -> int:
    mapping = {2: 4, 3: 1, 5: 6, 8: 7}
    return mapping.get(typ, 0)
```
(This maps trigger types to fill colors; essential and correct, as output uses these values.)

```python
def get_fill(r: int, c: int, typ: int, n: int) -> set:
    if r + 3 >= n or c + 3 >= n or c < 0:
        return set()
    fill = set()
    if typ == 2:
        for dc in range(4):
            fill.add((r, c + dc))
            fill.add((r + 3, c + dc))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 3:
        fill.add((r, c + 1))
        fill.add((r, c + 2))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 1))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 2))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 3))
    elif typ == 5:
        for dr in range(2):
            for dc in range(2):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
        for dr in range(2, 4):
            for dc in range(2, 4):
                fill.add((r + dr, c + dc))
    elif typ == 8:
        fill.add((r, c))
        fill.add((r, c + 3))
        fill.add((r + 3, c))
        fill.add((r + 3, c + 3))
        for dr in [1, 2]:
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 1))
            fill.add((r + dr, c + 2))
    return fill
```
(This defines the exact pattern fills for each type, relative to (r,c) top-left; critical for accurate placement, handles bounds, and uses sets for efficient overlap checks; appears correct based on training success.)

(The main program function integrates these, collects/sorts triggers, precomputes normal fills, and handles conflict resolution with shifts; useful but has a flaw in shift validation—see below.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of trigger collection, pattern filling, ordering, and basic conflict avoidance.
 * Worked: Precomputing normal fills and checking future conflicts correctly avoided overlaps in training cases; color mapping and pattern definitions matched expected shapes; skipping invalid bounds prevented errors.
 * Did not work: In the test case, the shift logic only tries alternatives against future conflicts but validates shifted fills against all normal fills (including past and non-conflicting futures), which may over-reject valid shifts if earlier triggers' normal fills block the shift (even if those earlier ones might have shifted themselves—code doesn't handle chained shifts).
 * Missed: No handling for multiple conflicting futures requiring different shifts; code stops at the first future-conflicting jj and tries only that delta, potentially missing better shifts for later conflicts.
 * extract_triggers logic (via loops and sorting) is essential and worked well for identifying and ordering triggers.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_color, get_fill, main program) are relevant, though the conflict resolution in main could be refined for recursive or multi-shift checks.
 * Training mismatches: None reported—all correct, suggesting patterns and colors align, but subtleties like shift deltas may not have been tested in training.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with mostly 0s, filled only with 7s (indicating only type 8 triggers present, no 2/3/5), forming repeating vertical patterns of what appear to be shifted or normal type 8 shapes (corners + middle columns) in columns like 0-3, 3-6? Wait, looking at row 1: 7s at indices 0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19—suggesting overlapping or adjacent 4-wide fills starting at c=0,3?, but 3-6 would be 3,4,5,6 (only 3,4 have 7s, missing 5,6?), inconsistent with full type 8 pattern.
 * Patterns emerge in blocks: rows 1-4 show staggered 7s resembling partial frames (e.g., row1/4: edges, row2/3: middles), repeating every 4 columns but shifted; rows 5-8 similar but sparser; rows 9-12 have denser fills including some inner 7s (e.g., row9: 7 at 0,3,7,11,15,19 and extras); rows 13-16 vary with more 0s in middles; rows 17+ all 0s—suggests triggers mostly in upper/mid rows, with shifts pushing some patterns rightward or skipping lower ones.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should have clean, non-overlapping type 8 patterns (4-high, with exactly 4 corners + 4 middle fills per shape=8 cells per trigger), but observed 7s show irregularities like missing middle fills in some potential shapes (e.g., row1 cols 0-3: only 0 and 3 filled, no c+1/c+2), and apparent overlaps or partial fills (e.g., row9 col4=0 but adjacent patterns suggest conflict not resolved). Top/bottom rows (0,18-19) all 0s make sense if no triggers there, but the density and staggering imply unresolved multi-conflicts where shifts failed validation against all normal fills, leading to skipped triggers—likely why it's different from expected (more complete coverage without gaps in patterns). Unknown exact input, but output lacks symmetry expected for type 8 (e.g., no full vertical alignment), suggesting shift logic over-constrains and skips valid placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where specific "trigger" cells (values 2, 3, 5, or 8) in an input grid dictate the placement of colored shapes (fills) into an output grid, following predefined patterns for each type. The challenge involves placing these shapes without overlaps, prioritizing non-conflicting positions, and shifting them horizontally by row deltas if needed to resolve future conflicts, while ensuring the output is a fully colored grid matching some expected pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other values are ignored, and each maps to a specific color (2->4, 3->1, 5->6, 8->7).
 * Shapes are 4x4 bounding boxes but with sparse fills: type 2 is a hollow rectangle (top/bottom/full rows, sides on middle); type 3 is similar but inner top/bottom partial; type 5 is two diagonal 2x2 blocks; type 8 is corners plus inner top/bottom partial.
 * Process triggers in row-major order (sorted by r, then c); for each, attempt normal placement (no shift); if it intersects already-placed fills or future triggers' fills, compute conflicting row deltas and try shifting the column by those deltas to find a non-overlapping spot.
 * Subtlety: Shifts are only horizontal (column offset by delta = future_r - current_r), and only if the shifted position doesn't go out of bounds or intersect placed/future fills; if no valid placement (normal or shifted), skip the trigger entirely.
 * Easy to miss: Future conflict checks use set intersection of fills, but only after sorting triggers; also, invalid positions (e.g., near edges) return empty sets, preventing placement.
 * Output is a grid of colors (non-zero) where fills are placed; zeros remain empty—puzzle likely expects full coverage without gaps or overlaps.
 * Considerations: No vertical shifts; deltas are row differences only; multiple shifts possible but code tries them in sorted order and places only the first valid one; no backtracking if all shifts fail.

(This defines exact sparse fill patterns for each type, relative to (r,c); crucial for accurate shape placement and intersection checks. Handles bounds checking early.)

(This is the core solver; extracts/sorts triggers, attempts normal then shifted placements, checks intersections with placed and future fills. Helpful but has bugs in shift logic for test case.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/last submission shown; it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid grasp of trigger extraction, sorting, fill patterns, color mapping, and basic non-overlap placement.
 * Worked: Normal placements without conflicts succeed; future delta computation catches some overlaps; skipping invalid bounds prevents errors.
 * Did not work: In test case, many triggers likely skipped due to unresolved conflicts/shifts, leading to incomplete filling; shift logic only tries deltas from conflicting futures but may not explore enough options or handle chained conflicts.
 * Subtle bug: Shifted future intersection check reuses original trigger positions (not shifted), which might miss some overlaps; also, only shifts current trigger, not adjusting futures.
 * No extraction function for full objects beyond triggers; could add one to pre-validate all possible placements.
 * get_fill is accurate and essential; get_color is correct but unused in test output (only 7's appear, suggesting only type 8 placed).
 * No unhelpful functions present; all code is relevant but shift resolution is incomplete/inefficient for complex grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (a 20x20 grid) does not look correct; it shows sparse, repeating patterns of 7's (likely from type 8 triggers) in the top-middle and bottom-middle sections, with large empty areas (rows 0, 17-19 fully zero, and many zeros elsewhere), suggesting many triggers were skipped rather than placed/shifted successfully.
 * Expected: Based on puzzle rules, the output should be a densely filled grid with mixed colors (1,4,6,7) covering most cells without overlaps or large gaps, as training examples passed fully; here, only color 7 appears, and patterns look like isolated 4x4 shapes without full coverage.
 * Differences: Top block (rows 1-4) has a checker-like 7 pattern but incomplete (e.g., row 1: 7 at cols 0,3-4,7-8,... but zeros elsewhere); middle sections (rows 5-16) have partial vertical strips of 7's but asymmetric and gappy (e.g., row 5 has 7's only at ends); bottom empty— this mismatches expected uniform, conflict-resolved filling.
 * Why incorrect: Likely shift logic fails on test's denser trigger layout (20x20 vs. smaller training?), causing cascades of skips; no color variety indicates types 2,3,5 not placed at all; mentally simulating, if test input has overlapping triggers across rows, deltas may push shifts out-of-bounds without alternatives.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 08:47:29] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify "trigger" cells with specific values (2, 3, 5, 8) and filling 4x4 patterns associated with each trigger type into an output grid using corresponding colors (4 for 2, 1 for 3, 6 for 5, 7 for 8), while resolving overlaps by horizontally shifting the patterns to avoid conflicts with already-placed fills or future triggers. The goal is to place as many non-overlapping patterns as possible in a deterministic order (sorted by row and column), skipping triggers that cannot be placed without conflict.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only cells with values exactly 2, 3, 5, or 8; other non-zero values in the input grid are ignored and do not trigger any fills.
 * Patterns are always 4 units high and wide, anchored to the trigger's row but potentially shifted in columns; vertical shifts are not allowed, and placements are invalid if they go out of bounds (e.g., if r + 3 >= n or shifted c + 3 >= n).
 * For type 2: Fills top and bottom rows fully (columns c to c+3) plus left and right edges in middle rows (rows r+1 to r+2).
 * For type 3: Fills middle two columns in top and bottom rows (c+1 to c+2), plus left and right edges in all middle rows (but only columns c and c+3 for rows r+1 to r+2; the code has a bug here as it fills c and c+3 for dr=1,2 but misses potential inner fills).
 * For type 5: Fills top-left 2x2 (rows r to r+1, cols c to c+1) and bottom-right 2x2 (rows r+2 to r+3, cols c+2 to c+3), creating a diagonal-like split.
 * For type 8: Fills the four corners of the 4x4 (r/c, r/c+3, r+3/c, r+3/c+3) plus middle two columns in middle rows (rows r+1 to r+2, cols c+1 to c+2).
 * Conflict resolution: Process triggers in row-major order; for each, first try original position if it doesn't overlap existing output or any future trigger's unshifted fill; if conflicted, try shifting right by deltas (differences in rows to future conflicting triggers, assuming vertical alignment issues are resolved horizontally) and place only if no overlap with existing or any future unshifted fills; skip if no valid shift found.
 * Subtlety: Shifts are only horizontal (column offset by delta = future_row - current_row), and only positive deltas are considered (sorted ascending); negative shifts are not attempted, which may miss some placements.
 * Another subtlety: Future conflict checks use unshifted fills for future triggers, assuming they will be placed in their original positions, which may be overly conservative if future triggers also shift.
 * Bounds checking is crucial: Invalid if shifted c < 0 or c+3 >= n.
 * Output grid starts all 0s; once placed, a cell keeps its color (no overwriting, but checks prevent placement if any cell in fill is non-zero).
 * Easy to miss: Type 3 fill in code seems incomplete (only partial middle fills; expected might include more based on visual symmetry, but unknown without input grids).
 * Processing order matters: Sorted by (row, col), so earlier triggers block later ones without reciprocity.
 * No vertical adjustments or rotations; patterns are rigid except for horizontal shifts.
 * If no valid placement (original or shifted), the trigger is entirely skipped, potentially leaving gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it successfully produced correct outputs for all 4 training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of trigger extraction, pattern filling, and basic conflict avoidance via horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Trigger identification and sorting by position; color mapping; generation of type-specific 4x4 fills; checking for overlaps with existing placements; identifying conflicting future triggers based on row deltas and attempting shifts by those deltas.
 * What didn't work: In the test case, the output shows incomplete or asymmetric placements (e.g., heavy use of color 7 for type 8, with patterns repeating every 4 rows/columns but skipping some areas), and several triggers appear skipped (e.g., rows 0, 18-19 all 0s suggest top/bottom triggers unplaced or out-of-bounds); also, type 3 fills may be buggy as they don't fully populate expected middle areas, leading to gappy verticals.
 * Shift logic only tries positive deltas from future rows, which may fail if conflicts require leftward (negative) shifts or if multiple shifts are needed cumulatively.
 * Future overlap checks assume unshifted future positions, which could block valid placements if later triggers would shift; this conservative approach works for training but may over-skip in denser test grids.
 * No handling for multiple conflicting deltas per future trigger or prioritizing minimal shifts; code picks the first valid sorted delta, which may not be optimal.
 * extract_triggers is essential and correct for identifying objects.
 * get_fill is mostly helpful but potentially incorrect for type 3 (observed partial fills in output don't match symmetric expectations, e.g., missing inner middles).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (20x20 grid) shows a repetitive pattern of color 7 (from type 8 triggers) forming hollow rectangles or frames every 4 rows (e.g., rows 1-4, 5-8 with gaps, then isolated in 9-17), with heavy clustering in columns 0-3, 7-10, etc., but many 0s in central areas (e.g., columns 4-6 often empty across rows).
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected a more uniform coverage or symmetric fills across the grid based on puzzle rules, but observed output has unexplained skips (e.g., entire rows 0 and 17-19 empty, suggesting boundary triggers skipped without shifts); also, patterns in rows 5-8 and 13-16 appear truncated or shifted inconsistently (e.g., row 5 has 7s only at ends, missing middles compared to row 1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input has triggers throughout, output should have more colors (1,4,6) visible, but it's almost all 7s or 0s, indicating possible over-skipping of non-8 triggers or failed placements for types 2/3/5; vertical alignment issues persist (e.g., row 9-12 have diagonal-like 7s but incomplete, unlike clean frames in row 1-4).
 * The empty top/bottom rows suggest no handling for triggers near edges without negative shifts; central sparsity (e.g., columns 4-6 mostly 0s) implies unresolved multi-trigger conflicts.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense for a grid with many type 8 triggers in a staggered layout, but the gaps and mono-color dominance indicate the shift/conflict logic is insufficient for denser or edge cases, missing some placements.

============================================================
=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:47:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based pattern completion or generation, where input grids contain "seeds" or partial structures represented by numbers (colors like 1, 4, 6, 7, possibly others), and the output requires placing or expanding specific shapes (e.g., hollow rectangles, vertical/horizontal bars, or connected components) in the correct color to match expected patterns, while preserving or copying certain existing elements. The rules likely involve detecting seed positions and orientations to "grow" symmetric or structured forms without overwriting unrelated areas.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns in expected outputs are color-specific: e.g., 4's form compact 4x4 hollow squares or rectangles (rows 1-4 and 6-9 in example 1; rows 1-4 and 5-8 in example 2), 6's form irregular or L-shaped connected groups (e.g., rows 12-15 in example 1), and 1's form sparse cross-like or dotted structures (e.g., rows 16-19 in example 1; rows 2-5 and 6-9 in example 2).
 * Existing patterns must be copied or preserved: e.g., 7's in example 4 expected are retained in specific positions (like vertical bars in columns 13-20), but the program only copies 7's while ignoring others like 4's, 6's, 1's.
 * Seeds seem to trigger shape placement: Expected outputs suggest seeds (possibly marked by certain numbers or positions) expand into fixed shapes, such as vertical/hollow rectangles spanning 4 rows/columns, but oriented horizontally or vertically based on input (e.g., example 3 has right-aligned 4's in columns 6-10).
 * Subtle overlaps and non-overwriting: New placements don't overwrite existing non-zero cells (e.g., in example 4, 7's integrate with 4's and 6's without conflict); grids are 20x20 or 10x10, with empty borders (all 0's in outer rows/columns).
 * Multi-pattern handling: Outputs combine multiple independent shapes (e.g., example 1 has stacked 4's, then 1+6 hybrids, then more 4's); vertical vs. horizontal orientation matters (e.g., example 2 rotates patterns 90 degrees compared to example 3).
 * No overwriting zeros only: Placements fill 0's but respect existing colors; all examples have mostly 0's in generated but dense patterns in expected.
 * Scale and positioning: Shapes are consistently 4 units high/wide (e.g., top/bottom bars in 4's), starting from seed positions; example 4 shows complex interleaving across the full 20x20 grid.
 * Edge cases: Empty inputs produce all 0's (but example 1 generated all 0's incorrectly when expecting patterns); smaller 10x10 grids (examples 2-3) vs. 20x20 (1 and 4) require same logic without hardcoding size.
 * Potential seed detection: Inputs likely have seeds like isolated numbers or partial outlines, but program assumes 8's (not present in shown expecteds), leading to no placements.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided functions (place_vertical_inner, copy_existing_patterns, place_for_seeds) are partially helpful for shape placement and copying but broken for this puzzle: place_vertical_inner hardcodes a 4x4 hollow vertical pattern with color 7, which doesn't match multi-color or horizontal needs; copy_existing_patterns only handles 7's, ignoring other colors; place_for_seeds assumes 8's as seeds, but examples use 1/4/6/7. No extraction functions were provided, but a hypothetical one for detecting seeds/objects would be essential.

```python
# Hypothetical helpful function: Detects connected components (blobs) by color and extracts bounding box/orientation for shape expansion.
# Not implemented in attempt, but could identify seeds like isolated 1's or partial 4-rectangles.

            if grid[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                color = grid[i][j]
                component = []
                stack = [(i, j)]

                    x, y = stack.pop()
                    component.append((x, y))
                    for dx, dy in directions:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            stack.append((nx, ny))
                
                if component:  # Determine bounding box and orientation (e.g., taller than wide -> vertical)
                    rows = [r for r, c in component]
                    cols = [c for r, c in component]
                    r_start, r_end = min(rows), max(rows)
                    c_start, c_end = min(cols), max(cols)
                    height, width = r_end - r_start + 1, c_end - c_start + 1
                    orient = 'v' if height > width else 'h'
                    patterns[color].append((r_start, c_start, orient))
    
    return patterns
```

```python
# Extension: Place shape based on extracted pattern (e.g., expand to 4x4 hollow for color 4).
def place_pattern(grid: List[List[int]], r: int, c: int, color: int, orient: str, size: int = 4) -> None:
    h, w = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if orient == 'v':
        # Place vertical hollow rectangle, skipping if out of bounds or non-zero
        for dr in range(size):
            for dc in [0, size-1]:  # Sides
                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                    grid[nr][nc] = color
            if dr in [1, 2]:  # Inner for middle rows, but adjust for hollow
                for dc in range(1, size-1):
                    nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
                    if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w and grid[nr][nc] == 0:
                        grid[nr][nc] = color
    elif orient == 'h':
        # Similar but horizontal
        pass  # Implement rotation
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed (INCORRECT), producing mostly all-0 grids or partial 7-only patterns, while expecteds have multi-color shapes (4's as hollow rectangles, 1's as crosses, 6's as connected groups, 7's preserved).
 * Training example 1: Generated all 0's (no placements), but expected stacked vertical 4-rectangles (rows 1-4,6-9), a 1+6 hybrid (rows 12-15,16-19); missed seed detection entirely, assuming non-existent 8's.
 * Training example 2: Generated all 0's, but expected rotated/mirrored 1 and 4 patterns (horizontal bars in rows 2-5 for 1's/4's, vertical in 6-9); program copied nothing since no 7's/8's in input (inferred).
 * Training example 3: Generated all 0's, but expected two 4-rectangles (one vertical right-aligned rows 0-3 cols 6-9, one horizontal bottom rows 6-9 cols 0-3/6-9); failed to handle orientation or position seeds.
 * Training example 4: Generated partial 7's (e.g., vertical bars in cols 12-19 rows 0-3/12-19, but misplaced like row 0: 7's at cols 12,15-16,19), but expected full integration of 4/6/1/7 across 20x20 (e.g., large 4-rects rows 0-3/4-7, 6's in rows 8-11/16-19); copied some 7's correctly but placed extras/overwrote implicitly, ignored other colors.
 * Assumed seeds are 8's for placing 7's only, but examples use varied colors (1,4,6) for different shapes; place_vertical_inner is helpful for vertical hollows but unhelpful for horizontal/orientation (doesn't rotate) or multi-color (hardcodes 7).
 * copy_existing_patterns works for 7's (partial success in example 4) but ignores other colors, leading to incomplete outputs.
 * place_for_seeds is broken/not helpful: Triggers on 8's (absent in examples), places wrong color/shape, doesn't detect connected/oriented seeds.
 * No object extraction, so missed detecting blobs (e.g., partial 4's as seeds); all attempts lack color-specific rules or orientation logic.
 * Function `place_vertical_inner` is partially helpful for vertical 4-unit shapes but broken for horizontal (e.g., example 2) or non-7 colors (don't use as-is; extend for rotation/color).
 * Overall, attempts show basic copying/placement intent but zero understanding of multi-color seeds or shapes, resulting in empty or mono-color outputs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 7's in clustered vertical/horizontal bars (e.g., rows 1-4 cols 0-3/4-7/8-11/12-15/16-19 with 7's on edges/middles; similar in rows 9-12/13-16/17-19), resembling attempted hollow rectangles or ladders, but it does not look correct—it's all 7's (mono-color) in a repetitive grid-wide pattern, ignoring potential multi-color needs from training (e.g., no 4's/1's/6's integration like example 4 expected). This seems over-placed (dense 7's everywhere vs. sparse expecteds) and likely triggered by assumed 8-seed positions not matching real inputs; without expected test grid, it mismatches training patterns (e.g., no empty borders, wrong shapes), suggesting continued failure on seed detection/orientation. It partially "makes sense" as expanded verticals (using place_vertical_inner) but is incorrect due to color/shape mismatches and overgeneration.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger cells (types 2, 3, 5, or 8) initiate the placement of predefined 4-unit-high pattern shapes (resembling tetromino-like or frame structures) that fill adjacent cells with a corresponding color (4 for type 2, 1 for 3, 6 for 5, 7 for 8). Placements are processed in row-major order, filling normally if no conflicts with future triggers, but shifting the pattern horizontally by the row delta to an alternative column if conflicts arise, ensuring no overlaps across all triggers.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other cell values are ignored and do not trigger fills.
 * Each trigger places a 4x4 bounding box pattern: type 2 fills top/bottom rows fully and left/right edges in middle rows (like a hollow rectangle); type 3 fills middle two columns in top/bottom and left/right edges in middle rows (like a narrow frame); type 5 fills top-left 2x2 and bottom-right 2x2 (diagonal blocks); type 8 fills corners of the 4x4 and middle two columns in middle rows (like an X or cross frame).
 * Patterns must fit within grid bounds (n x n); if a placement (normal or shifted) would go out of bounds, it is skipped.
 * Conflicts are checked only against future triggers (not past ones), using set intersection of fill cells; if any overlap, attempt a single horizontal shift by the row difference (delta = future_trigger_row - current_row) to new column c + delta, and verify the alternative fill against ALL other normal fills (not just futures).
 * If a valid non-conflicting placement (normal or shifted) is found, apply it immediately; otherwise, skip the trigger entirely—no partial or multiple shift attempts.
 * Grid is square (n x n), output initializes to 0s, and multiple triggers can fill the same cell only if no conflicts were detected during placement (but the conflict check prevents this).
 * Subtlety: Shifting is always to the right (c + delta, where delta > 0 since futures are later rows), and only one shift per conflicting future (tries futures in order, stops at first valid shift).
 * Easy to miss: Normal fills are precomputed for all triggers upfront, but shifts are computed on-the-fly and checked against all precomputed normal fills (not shifted ones), assuming no chains of shifts.
 * Colors override previous fills if they happen (but conflict avoidance should prevent this); no blending or priority beyond order.
 * Empty grid or no triggers results in all-0 output; triggers are sorted row-major for processing.
 * Bounds check for shifts: alt_c must allow a full 4-wide pattern (alt_c >=0 and alt_c+3 < n).

    mapping = {2: 4, 3: 1, 5: 6, 8: 7}

    return fill
```
(This defines the exact pattern fills for each type, relative to (r,c) top-left; critical for accurate placement, handles bounds, and uses sets for efficient overlap checks; appears correct based on training success.)

(The main program function integrates these, collects/sorts triggers, precomputes normal fills, and handles conflict resolution with shifts; useful but has a flaw in shift validation—see below.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (last) submission analyzed; no prior attempts detailed, but it successfully handled all 4 training examples (CORRECT), demonstrating core understanding of trigger collection, pattern filling, ordering, and basic conflict avoidance.
 * Worked: Precomputing normal fills and checking future conflicts correctly avoided overlaps in training cases; color mapping and pattern definitions matched expected shapes; skipping invalid bounds prevented errors.
 * Did not work: In the test case, the shift logic only tries alternatives against future conflicts but validates shifted fills against all normal fills (including past and non-conflicting futures), which may over-reject valid shifts if earlier triggers' normal fills block the shift (even if those earlier ones might have shifted themselves—code doesn't handle chained shifts).
 * Missed: No handling for multiple conflicting futures requiring different shifts; code stops at the first future-conflicting jj and tries only that delta, potentially missing better shifts for later conflicts.
 * extract_triggers logic (via loops and sorting) is essential and worked well for identifying and ordering triggers.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided (get_color, get_fill, main program) are relevant, though the conflict resolution in main could be refined for recursive or multi-shift checks.
 * Training mismatches: None reported—all correct, suggesting patterns and colors align, but subtleties like shift deltas may not have been tested in training.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with mostly 0s, filled only with 7s (indicating only type 8 triggers present, no 2/3/5), forming repeating vertical patterns of what appear to be shifted or normal type 8 shapes (corners + middle columns) in columns like 0-3, 3-6? Wait, looking at row 1: 7s at indices 0,3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19—suggesting overlapping or adjacent 4-wide fills starting at c=0,3?, but 3-6 would be 3,4,5,6 (only 3,4 have 7s, missing 5,6?), inconsistent with full type 8 pattern.
 * Patterns emerge in blocks: rows 1-4 show staggered 7s resembling partial frames (e.g., row1/4: edges, row2/3: middles), repeating every 4 columns but shifted; rows 5-8 similar but sparser; rows 9-12 have denser fills including some inner 7s (e.g., row9: 7 at 0,3,7,11,15,19 and extras); rows 13-16 vary with more 0s in middles; rows 17+ all 0s—suggests triggers mostly in upper/mid rows, with shifts pushing some patterns rightward or skipping lower ones.
 * Does not look fully correct: Expected output should have clean, non-overlapping type 8 patterns (4-high, with exactly 4 corners + 4 middle fills per shape=8 cells per trigger), but observed 7s show irregularities like missing middle fills in some potential shapes (e.g., row1 cols 0-3: only 0 and 3 filled, no c+1/c+2), and apparent overlaps or partial fills (e.g., row9 col4=0 but adjacent patterns suggest conflict not resolved). Top/bottom rows (0,18-19) all 0s make sense if no triggers there, but the density and staggering imply unresolved multi-conflicts where shifts failed validation against all normal fills, leading to skipped triggers—likely why it's different from expected (more complete coverage without gaps in patterns). Unknown exact input, but output lacks symmetry expected for type 8 (e.g., no full vertical alignment), suggesting shift logic over-constrains and skips valid placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where specific "trigger" cells (values 2, 3, 5, or 8) in an input grid dictate the placement of colored shapes (fills) into an output grid, following predefined patterns for each type. The challenge involves placing these shapes without overlaps, prioritizing non-conflicting positions, and shifting them horizontally by row deltas if needed to resolve future conflicts, while ensuring the output is a fully colored grid matching some expected pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other values are ignored, and each maps to a specific color (2->4, 3->1, 5->6, 8->7).
 * Shapes are 4x4 bounding boxes but with sparse fills: type 2 is a hollow rectangle (top/bottom/full rows, sides on middle); type 3 is similar but inner top/bottom partial; type 5 is two diagonal 2x2 blocks; type 8 is corners plus inner top/bottom partial.
 * Process triggers in row-major order (sorted by r, then c); for each, attempt normal placement (no shift); if it intersects already-placed fills or future triggers' fills, compute conflicting row deltas and try shifting the column by those deltas to find a non-overlapping spot.
 * Subtlety: Shifts are only horizontal (column offset by delta = future_r - current_r), and only if the shifted position doesn't go out of bounds or intersect placed/future fills; if no valid placement (normal or shifted), skip the trigger entirely.
 * Easy to miss: Future conflict checks use set intersection of fills, but only after sorting triggers; also, invalid positions (e.g., near edges) return empty sets, preventing placement.
 * Output is a grid of colors (non-zero) where fills are placed; zeros remain empty—puzzle likely expects full coverage without gaps or overlaps.
 * Considerations: No vertical shifts; deltas are row differences only; multiple shifts possible but code tries them in sorted order and places only the first valid one; no backtracking if all shifts fail.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This is the core solver; extracts/sorts triggers, attempts normal then shifted placements, checks intersections with placed and future fills. Helpful but has bugs in shift logic for test case.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/last submission shown; it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid grasp of trigger extraction, sorting, fill patterns, color mapping, and basic non-overlap placement.
 * Worked: Normal placements without conflicts succeed; future delta computation catches some overlaps; skipping invalid bounds prevents errors.
 * Did not work: In test case, many triggers likely skipped due to unresolved conflicts/shifts, leading to incomplete filling; shift logic only tries deltas from conflicting futures but may not explore enough options or handle chained conflicts.
 * Subtle bug: Shifted future intersection check reuses original trigger positions (not shifted), which might miss some overlaps; also, only shifts current trigger, not adjusting futures.
 * No extraction function for full objects beyond triggers; could add one to pre-validate all possible placements.
 * get_fill is accurate and essential; get_color is correct but unused in test output (only 7's appear, suggesting only type 8 placed).
 * No unhelpful functions present; all code is relevant but shift resolution is incomplete/inefficient for complex grids.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (a 20x20 grid) does not look correct; it shows sparse, repeating patterns of 7's (likely from type 8 triggers) in the top-middle and bottom-middle sections, with large empty areas (rows 0, 17-19 fully zero, and many zeros elsewhere), suggesting many triggers were skipped rather than placed/shifted successfully.
 * Expected: Based on puzzle rules, the output should be a densely filled grid with mixed colors (1,4,6,7) covering most cells without overlaps or large gaps, as training examples passed fully; here, only color 7 appears, and patterns look like isolated 4x4 shapes without full coverage.
 * Differences: Top block (rows 1-4) has a checker-like 7 pattern but incomplete (e.g., row 1: 7 at cols 0,3-4,7-8,... but zeros elsewhere); middle sections (rows 5-16) have partial vertical strips of 7's but asymmetric and gappy (e.g., row 5 has 7's only at ends); bottom empty— this mismatches expected uniform, conflict-resolved filling.
 * Why incorrect: Likely shift logic fails on test's denser trigger layout (20x20 vs. smaller training?), causing cascades of skips; no color variety indicates types 2,3,5 not placed at all; mentally simulating, if test input has overlapping triggers across rows, deltas may push shifts out-of-bounds without alternatives.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid to identify "trigger" cells with specific values (2, 3, 5, 8) and filling 4x4 patterns associated with each trigger type into an output grid using corresponding colors (4 for 2, 1 for 3, 6 for 5, 7 for 8), while resolving overlaps by horizontally shifting the patterns to avoid conflicts with already-placed fills or future triggers. The goal is to place as many non-overlapping patterns as possible in a deterministic order (sorted by row and column), skipping triggers that cannot be placed without conflict.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only cells with values exactly 2, 3, 5, or 8; other non-zero values in the input grid are ignored and do not trigger any fills.
 * Patterns are always 4 units high and wide, anchored to the trigger's row but potentially shifted in columns; vertical shifts are not allowed, and placements are invalid if they go out of bounds (e.g., if r + 3 >= n or shifted c + 3 >= n).
 * For type 2: Fills top and bottom rows fully (columns c to c+3) plus left and right edges in middle rows (rows r+1 to r+2).
 * For type 3: Fills middle two columns in top and bottom rows (c+1 to c+2), plus left and right edges in all middle rows (but only columns c and c+3 for rows r+1 to r+2; the code has a bug here as it fills c and c+3 for dr=1,2 but misses potential inner fills).
 * For type 5: Fills top-left 2x2 (rows r to r+1, cols c to c+1) and bottom-right 2x2 (rows r+2 to r+3, cols c+2 to c+3), creating a diagonal-like split.
 * For type 8: Fills the four corners of the 4x4 (r/c, r/c+3, r+3/c, r+3/c+3) plus middle two columns in middle rows (rows r+1 to r+2, cols c+1 to c+2).
 * Conflict resolution: Process triggers in row-major order; for each, first try original position if it doesn't overlap existing output or any future trigger's unshifted fill; if conflicted, try shifting right by deltas (differences in rows to future conflicting triggers, assuming vertical alignment issues are resolved horizontally) and place only if no overlap with existing or any future unshifted fills; skip if no valid shift found.
 * Subtlety: Shifts are only horizontal (column offset by delta = future_row - current_row), and only positive deltas are considered (sorted ascending); negative shifts are not attempted, which may miss some placements.
 * Another subtlety: Future conflict checks use unshifted fills for future triggers, assuming they will be placed in their original positions, which may be overly conservative if future triggers also shift.
 * Bounds checking is crucial: Invalid if shifted c < 0 or c+3 >= n.
 * Output grid starts all 0s; once placed, a cell keeps its color (no overwriting, but checks prevent placement if any cell in fill is non-zero).
 * Easy to miss: Type 3 fill in code seems incomplete (only partial middle fills; expected might include more based on visual symmetry, but unknown without input grids).
 * Processing order matters: Sorted by (row, col), so earlier triggers block later ones without reciprocity.
 * No vertical adjustments or rotations; patterns are rigid except for horizontal shifts.
 * If no valid placement (original or shifted), the trigger is entirely skipped, potentially leaving gaps.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it successfully produced correct outputs for all 4 training examples, demonstrating solid understanding of trigger extraction, pattern filling, and basic conflict avoidance via horizontal shifts.
 * What worked: Trigger identification and sorting by position; color mapping; generation of type-specific 4x4 fills; checking for overlaps with existing placements; identifying conflicting future triggers based on row deltas and attempting shifts by those deltas.
 * What didn't work: In the test case, the output shows incomplete or asymmetric placements (e.g., heavy use of color 7 for type 8, with patterns repeating every 4 rows/columns but skipping some areas), and several triggers appear skipped (e.g., rows 0, 18-19 all 0s suggest top/bottom triggers unplaced or out-of-bounds); also, type 3 fills may be buggy as they don't fully populate expected middle areas, leading to gappy verticals.
 * Shift logic only tries positive deltas from future rows, which may fail if conflicts require leftward (negative) shifts or if multiple shifts are needed cumulatively.
 * Future overlap checks assume unshifted future positions, which could block valid placements if later triggers would shift; this conservative approach works for training but may over-skip in denser test grids.
 * No handling for multiple conflicting deltas per future trigger or prioritizing minimal shifts; code picks the first valid sorted delta, which may not be optimal.
 * extract_triggers is essential and correct for identifying objects.
 * get_fill is mostly helpful but potentially incorrect for type 3 (observed partial fills in output don't match symmetric expectations, e.g., missing inner middles).

**Test output:**
 * The test output (20x20 grid) shows a repetitive pattern of color 7 (from type 8 triggers) forming hollow rectangles or frames every 4 rows (e.g., rows 1-4, 5-8 with gaps, then isolated in 9-17), with heavy clustering in columns 0-3, 7-10, etc., but many 0s in central areas (e.g., columns 4-6 often empty across rows).
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected a more uniform coverage or symmetric fills across the grid based on puzzle rules, but observed output has unexplained skips (e.g., entire rows 0 and 17-19 empty, suggesting boundary triggers skipped without shifts); also, patterns in rows 5-8 and 13-16 appear truncated or shifted inconsistently (e.g., row 5 has 7s only at ends, missing middles compared to row 1).
 * Differences from expected: If test input has triggers throughout, output should have more colors (1,4,6) visible, but it's almost all 7s or 0s, indicating possible over-skipping of non-8 triggers or failed placements for types 2/3/5; vertical alignment issues persist (e.g., row 9-12 have diagonal-like 7s but incomplete, unlike clean frames in row 1-4).
 * The empty top/bottom rows suggest no handling for triggers near edges without negative shifts; central sparsity (e.g., columns 4-6 mostly 0s) implies unresolved multi-trigger conflicts.
 * Overall, test output partially makes sense for a grid with many type 8 triggers in a staggered layout, but the gaps and mono-color dominance indicate the shift/conflict logic is insufficient for denser or edge cases, missing some placements.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:54:42] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a grid-based visual puzzle where specific trigger values (2, 3, 5, 8) in the input grid indicate starting positions for predefined shapes (like polyomino-like fills), which must be placed with associated colors (4 for 2, 1 for 3, 6 for 5, 7 for 8) into an output grid, avoiding overlaps with already placed shapes or future triggers by optionally shifting the shape horizontally based on conflicting deltas; the goal is to cover the grid without intersections while respecting boundaries and order.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only types 2, 3, 5, 8; other values are ignored, and placements use a mapping to colors, but in the test output, only 7 appears (suggesting only type 8 triggers or a bug in color application).
 * Shapes are asymmetric and span 4 rows and 4 columns: type 2 is like two vertical bars at edges with horizontal connectors; type 3 is a narrow vertical with side bars; type 5 is two 2x2 blocks offset; type 8 is corners with inner horizontals—must handle boundary clipping with get_fill returning empty set if out-of-bounds.
 * Processing order is row-major (sorted by r then c), placing shapes sequentially; if normal position intersects placed cells or future shapes, compute conflicting row deltas from future triggers and try shifting column by those deltas (sorted ascending) to find a non-conflicting position.
 * Subtlety: Shifts are only horizontal (column only, row fixed), and only tried for conflicting deltas; no vertical shifts or other adjustments; future intersections checked only after shift, but not re-computed deltas dynamically.
 * Easy to miss: Intersections checked with placed (out_grid !=0) and futures (set intersection of fills); if no conflicts, place normally; if shift succeeds, place there and skip further; unplaced triggers are silently skipped if no position found.
 * Boundaries: Fills clipped to 0<=rr<n, 0<=cc<n; if entire fill is out (e.g., c<0), skip entirely.
 * No overlaps allowed at all (even partial); colors are uniform per shape but test shows only 7s, possibly indicating all triggers are type 8 or color mapping issue.
 * Order matters: Early placements block later ones, so sorting triggers ensures consistent left-to-right, top-to-bottom processing.
 * Potential subtlety: Deltas are row differences (fr - r), used as column shifts (sc = c + delta)—this assumes vertical conflicts imply horizontal adjustments, which may not always resolve overlaps correctly if shapes are not aligned.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple

def get_color(typ: int) -> int:
    mapping = {2: 4, 3: 1, 5: 6, 8: 7}
    return mapping.get(typ, 0)
```
(This maps trigger types to output colors; essential for correct filling, but note it defaults to 0, which matches empty.)

```python
def get_fill(r: int, c: int, typ: int, n: int) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if c < 0:
        return set()
    fill: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    positions: List[Tuple[int, int]] = []
    # (detailed position appending for each typ as in the program)
    for rr, cc in positions:
        if 0 <= rr < n and 0 <= cc < n:
            fill.add((rr, cc))
    return fill
```
(This defines shape positions relative to (r,c), clips to grid, and handles invalid c; core to extracting and placing shapes without overlap.)

(The main program function orchestrates trigger extraction, sorting, conflict detection, shifting, and placement; helpful as a skeleton but needs refinement for color variety and shift logic.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown, so no prior comparisons, but it successfully passed all 4 training examples, indicating core shape definitions (get_fill), color mapping, sequential processing, and basic conflict avoidance (normal placement + delta-based shifts) work for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Trigger detection and sorting ensure ordered placement; intersection checks (with placed and futures) prevent overlaps in training; clipping handles boundaries; shapes match expected polyomino-like fills for types 2/3/5/8.
 * What didn't work: In the test, only color 7 appears despite potential for multiple types, suggesting either all triggers are 8 (possible) or a bug in applying get_color (e.g., not called in shift path? but code shows it is); no unplaced triggers handled explicitly, so some shapes may be skipped silently if shifts fail.
 * No extraction function for full objects beyond triggers, but get_fill acts as one for shapes; no unhelpful functions present, but the delta-based shifting assumes row conflicts predict column shifts, which may fail for misaligned shapes (unknown if this caused training passes but test issues).
 * Trainings all correct, so shape positions and basic no-overlap logic are solid; no noted misses like omitting dividers or mismatching blobs.

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid with a repeating, symmetric pattern of 7s and 0s, resembling offset checkerboards or modular shape placements (e.g., rows 1-4 and 17-20 mirror a dense pattern, while middle rows have sparser, isolated 7s in columns like 0-3, 16-19).
 * It does not look fully correct or complete: Only 7s are used (no 1,4,6), implying either only type 8 triggers in input (plausible for test) or color application bug; patterns show vertical/horizontal bars and blocks consistent with type 8/2/3 shapes, but sparsity in rows 5-16 suggests many shifts or skips due to conflicts, leaving large empty areas (e.g., columns 4-15 mostly 0 in middle).
 * Differences from expected: Expected a fully or densely filled grid with mixed colors if multiple trigger types present (unknown input, but code supports it); here, it's patchy—e.g., row 5 has 7s only at ends, row 9 has extras in middle (columns 8-9,11-12)—which may indicate successful shifts but incomplete coverage; if puzzle requires all triggers placed without skips, this fails as some areas look underfilled; looks patterned but asymmetric in middle, possibly missing vertical shift option or better conflict resolution.
 * Overall, it makes partial sense (avoids overlaps, places some shapes), but seems incorrect due to uniform color and incomplete fill—hard to confirm without input grid, but differs from a "solved" expectation of balanced, multi-color coverage.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:55:15] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-02 08:59:01] Response:
- **Red tiles and Yellow tile creation/transformation**: In every training example, Red tiles (holes=0, pixels=1, single-unit bbox) at position (x, y) consistently interact to produce or transform into Yellow tiles in the output. The basic interaction expands the bbox to [x, y, x+3, y+3] (4x4 units), with holes=1 and pixels=12. This holds for isolated Reds across all examples (e.g., Train 1: all 4 Reds produce separate Yellows; Train 2: both Reds produce separate Yellows; Train 3: 3 Reds produce separate Yellows, suppressing/ignoring the input Yellow at [0,0,3,3]; Train 4: isolated Reds at [8,4], [12,8], [8,12] produce separate Yellows). For clustered Reds (Train 4 only, e.g., top-left cluster at [0,0],[4,0],[0,4] and bottom-right at [12,16],[16,16],[16,12]), expansions overlap and merge into a single larger Yellow with increased holes (holes=3, pixels=36, bbox expanded to cover ~8x8 units), but the core property (Red position → Yellow expansion right/down with holes tied to Red count) remains consistent. No other colors or positions produce this exact Yellow transformation in all examples. Directionality is consistent: expansion only increases x and y (right and down), never left/up.

- **Unknown interactions**: No other connections (e.g., Green → Blue segments, Orange → Pink 2x2, Blue preservation, Pink absorption into Yellows, Maroon → Dark Red) are present in every training example, as they depend on colors/positions absent in at least one train (e.g., no Greens in Train 3). Clustered Red merging details (e.g., exact hole count per Red or suppression threshold like in Train 3's [4,4] Red near input Yellow) cannot be explained consistently without forcing unfit patterns. Input Yellow in Train 3 interacts with Reds (disappears while enabling their Yellows), but this is not replicable in other trains lacking input Yellows. No consistent hole-origin mechanism (e.g., why holes=1 for singles, =3 for clusters) beyond Red count correlation. Position-to-color (non-Red) or hole-to-movement effects are absent or inconsistent across all.

[2025-10-02 08:59:01] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Red tiles and Yellow tile creation/transformation**: In every training example, Red tiles (holes=0, pixels=1, single-unit bbox) at position (x, y) consistently interact to produce or transform into Yellow tiles in the output. The basic interaction expands the bbox to [x, y, x+3, y+3] (4x4 units), with holes=1 and pixels=12. This holds for isolated Reds across all examples (e.g., Train 1: all 4 Reds produce separate Yellows; Train 2: both Reds produce separate Yellows; Train 3: 3 Reds produce separate Yellows, suppressing/ignoring the input Yellow at [0,0,3,3]; Train 4: isolated Reds at [8,4], [12,8], [8,12] produce separate Yellows). For clustered Reds (Train 4 only, e.g., top-left cluster at [0,0],[4,0],[0,4] and bottom-right at [12,16],[16,16],[16,12]), expansions overlap and merge into a single larger Yellow with increased holes (holes=3, pixels=36, bbox expanded to cover ~8x8 units), but the core property (Red position → Yellow expansion right/down with holes tied to Red count) remains consistent. No other colors or positions produce this exact Yellow transformation in all examples. Directionality is consistent: expansion only increases x and y (right and down), never left/up.

- **Unknown interactions**: No other connections (e.g., Green → Blue segments, Orange → Pink 2x2, Blue preservation, Pink absorption into Yellows, Maroon → Dark Red) are present in every training example, as they depend on colors/positions absent in at least one train (e.g., no Greens in Train 3). Clustered Red merging details (e.g., exact hole count per Red or suppression threshold like in Train 3's [4,4] Red near input Yellow) cannot be explained consistently without forcing unfit patterns. Input Yellow in Train 3 interacts with Reds (disappears while enabling their Yellows), but this is not replicable in other trains lacking input Yellows. No consistent hole-origin mechanism (e.g., why holes=1 for singles, =3 for clusters) beyond Red count correlation. Position-to-color (non-Red) or hole-to-movement effects are absent or inconsistent across all.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10
