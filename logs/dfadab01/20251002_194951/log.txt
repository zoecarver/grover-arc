=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 19:49:51] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:07:05] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid input containing "seeds" (specific numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that represent starting points or partial forms of letter-like shapes (H, U, Z, O) in 4x4 blocks, where the goal is to detect these seeds—either isolated or already partially matching the shape—and complete or redraw the full shape in the output grid using a mapped "color" value (e.g., 1 for H shapes). The output transforms the input by filling in these standardized patterns while clearing non-pattern areas in the 4x4 block, effectively rendering a completed version of the intended shapes without altering unrelated parts of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are strictly 4x4 and anchored at the seed position (r, c), with patterns defined as specific coordinate lists (e.g., H uses corners and middle crossbars; U is a U-shape; Z is diagonal-step; O is a hollow square/ring).
 * Only specific seed values are handled (1→H color 1; 2→U color 4; 3→H color 1; 5→Z color 6; 7→O color 7; 8→O color 7); unrecognized numbers or positions out of 4x4 bounds are ignored.
 * Detection logic: A shape is drawn if the seed is "isolated" (4x4 block empty except seed) OR if the block already exactly matches the pattern (all pattern positions filled with target color, non-pattern positions empty except possibly the seed).
 * Subtlety: The seed itself (at (0,0) relative) is treated specially in matching—non-pattern checks exclude it to allow partial inputs, but isolation strictly requires the entire 4x4 empty except seed; this can miss partially filled shapes that aren't exact matches.
 * Bounds checking is critical: Any pattern position or check extending beyond grid size (size x size) skips or fails the shape.
 * Overlaps aren't prevented: Multiple seeds can draw into the same output cells, potentially overwriting with the last-processed color (order is row-major scan).
 * Clearing: draw_shape zeros non-pattern cells in the 4x4 block, which could erase parts of adjacent or overlapping input elements if not careful.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so large grids allow multiple non-overlapping shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Input may have pre-filled partial shapes that need exact matching (not just presence of seed color), and isolation is a fallback only for empty blocks; also, colors in input must match the target for pattern verification.
 * No rotation/reflection: Patterns are fixed orientation.
 * Output starts as all zeros, only modified where shapes are drawn; unchanged input areas remain zeroed if processed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds or exact pattern matches and drawing the corresponding shapes/colors without errors.
 * What worked: Pattern definitions captured core H/U/Z/O forms; isolation fallback allowed empty-block seeds to trigger drawing; matching ensured partial/exact shapes were recognized and redrawn consistently; bounds checking prevented crashes on edge seeds.
 * What didn't work: Potential for overwriting in overlaps (e.g., if seeds are adjacent, later draws zero non-pattern areas, possibly erasing prior shapes); H pattern may be incomplete (lacks full verticals, leading to partial H's); no handling for seeds outside mapped values (silently ignored, which is correct but could miss puzzle variants); strict exact-match requirement might fail on "close but not exact" partials.
 * The main program loop scans every cell as a potential seed, which is efficient but processes even non-seeds (skipped quickly).
 * No extraction of full objects; relies on local 4x4 checks, which works for non-overlapping shapes but may fail if shapes overlap or span larger areas.
 * Training examples all passed, indicating solid understanding of isolated/exact detection and drawing, but no details on what training inputs looked like (e.g., partial vs. empty blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 20x20 grid (inferred from 20-element rows x 20 rows, with top/bottom rows all zeros), primarily filled with 7's in repeating 4x4 blocks forming H-like and O-like patterns across rows 1-17, with a large zeroed central area (columns ~8-15 in middle rows) and some incomplete or truncated shapes (e.g., row 5 has partial H's then zeros; rows 9-13 show staggered 7's that look like incomplete O's or misaligned H's).
 * It makes partial sense: The 7's form coherent H patterns in blocks (e.g., columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., in rows 1-4 match H verticals/crossbar), and O-like rings appear in places (e.g., rows 9-12, columns 8-11), suggesting the input had multiple 7/8 seeds triggering O/H draws with color 7; the zeroed areas indicate clearing of non-pattern cells, and borders are untouched (all zeros).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some patterns appear truncated or asymmetric (e.g., row 9: [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] suggests a missing left H vertical and isolated 7's that don't form complete 4x4 shapes; row 13 has [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] with gaps that might indicate failed bounds/isolation checks or overlapping clears erasing parts). Expected output should have cleaner, non-overlapping full shapes without stray 7's or zeroed intrusions into pattern areas—differences likely due to adjacent seeds causing draw_shape to zero neighboring cells unexpectedly, or H pattern definition missing positions (e.g., no (0,0)/(3,0) for full H verticals). The central zero block (rows 5-8, columns 8-19) looks like over-clearing, possibly from a seed that matched but zeroed a larger area; without input, unclear if this matches expected (e.g., if input had clustered seeds), but it deviates from ideal isolated shape renders seen in training success.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 20:07:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:20:34] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) at the top-left of potential 4x4 blocks indicate shapes (rectangle, diamond, Z, anti-diamond), and the program must validate the block's content, clear it, and refill only the shape's positions with a corresponding color value, producing a rendered output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only at the top-left (i,j) position; the shape patterns do not always include (0,0) relative to the trigger (e.g., diamond excludes it), but validation allows non-zero at (0,0) even if not in the pattern set.
 * Validation (is_valid) ensures that within the 4x4 block, any non-zero cells (except the trigger at (0,0)) must exactly match positions in the shape's pattern set; extraneous non-zeros outside the pattern invalidate the block.
 * Output clears the entire 4x4 to 0 before filling only the pattern positions with the color, but this is done sequentially in row-major order, so overlapping blocks (common in larger grids) can cause later placements to overwrite earlier ones without merging or prioritization.
 * Grid size is variable (n x n), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so loop only to n-3; empty or invalid blocks remain 0.
 * Colors are hardcoded per trigger: 2=rectangle/4, 3=diamond/1, 5=Z/6, 7/8=anti_diamond/7; no other values trigger anything.
 * Subtlety: Patterns can tile or adjoin without overlap in simple cases (e.g., training), but in dense grids, sequential overwriting distorts shapes; no deduplication or overlap resolution.
 * Easy to miss: The input grid may have noise or partial shapes, but validation strictly rejects if any cell outside pattern (and not trigger) is non-zero; output ignores input values except for triggering and validation.
 * All considerations: Shapes are exact sets of relative (di,dj) positions; no rotation, scaling, or variable sizes; output is always n x n with 0s where no pattern fills; potential for multiple triggers in one block if not validated properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def get_type_color(v: int) -> tp.Tuple[tp.Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2: return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3: return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5: return 'z', 6
    if v == 7: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    if v == 8: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid understanding of single-block shape detection, validation, and filling for isolated or non-overlapping cases.
 * What worked: Trigger mapping, pattern sets, and validation logic perfectly matched training inputs, producing correct outputs without distortion.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for overlapping 4x4 blocks in larger grids; sequential processing overwrites prior fills, potentially corrupting adjacent or tiled shapes (e.g., in test, irregular patterns suggest overwrite artifacts).
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond scanning for triggers; assumes all shapes are axis-aligned 4x4 starting at integer positions, which works for training but may miss shifted or merged shapes.
 * The clearing step (set output 4x4 to 0 before filling) prevents input bleed but exacerbates overwrite issues in dense grids.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, as all provided are relevant; however, the main loop's lack of prioritization (e.g., process in reverse order or merge fills) is a gap for complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 20x20 grid with top/bottom rows all 0s (expected for boundary), and middle rows showing repeated 7-0 patterns resembling tiled anti-diamonds (e.g., rows 1,4,9,12,13,17 have [7,0,0,7,...] motifs), but with irregularities like row 5's partial disruptions (e.g., 0,0,7,0 in positions 8-11) and row 10's mixes (e.g., 0,7,7,0 but then 0,0,7,0), suggesting overlapping triggers where later anti_diamonds (color 7) overwrote parts of earlier ones.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should render clean, non-overlapping or merged shapes without distortions, but observed effects show jagged or incomplete lines (e.g., row 6 has 7s in expected diamond-like spots but cuts off mid-pattern around columns 8-16), differing from a uniform tiling; this is likely due to sequential overwriting, as training (smaller/simpler?) had no such overlaps.
 * The all-0 borders make sense (no room for full 4x4), but internal patterns are denser than isolated shapes, implying test input has many adjacent 7/8 triggers; output fails to preserve all shape integrity, e.g., row 11's [0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,...] shows mismatched fills vs. pure anti_diamond sets.
 * Unknown why some areas (e.g., columns 12-15 in rows 5-9) are mostly 0s amid 7s—possibly invalid blocks or overwrite to 0—but it disrupts expected continuity; overall, test output demonstrates partial success (patterns emerge) but not precision, confirming overlap as the key flaw.

[2025-10-02 20:20:34] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) at the top-left of potential 4x4 blocks indicate shapes (rectangle, diamond, Z, anti-diamond), and the program must validate the block's content, clear it, and refill only the shape's positions with a corresponding color value, producing a rendered output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only at the top-left (i,j) position; the shape patterns do not always include (0,0) relative to the trigger (e.g., diamond excludes it), but validation allows non-zero at (0,0) even if not in the pattern set.
 * Validation (is_valid) ensures that within the 4x4 block, any non-zero cells (except the trigger at (0,0)) must exactly match positions in the shape's pattern set; extraneous non-zeros outside the pattern invalidate the block.
 * Output clears the entire 4x4 to 0 before filling only the pattern positions with the color, but this is done sequentially in row-major order, so overlapping blocks (common in larger grids) can cause later placements to overwrite earlier ones without merging or prioritization.
 * Grid size is variable (n x n), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so loop only to n-3; empty or invalid blocks remain 0.
 * Colors are hardcoded per trigger: 2=rectangle/4, 3=diamond/1, 5=Z/6, 7/8=anti_diamond/7; no other values trigger anything.
 * Subtlety: Patterns can tile or adjoin without overlap in simple cases (e.g., training), but in dense grids, sequential overwriting distorts shapes; no deduplication or overlap resolution.
 * Easy to miss: The input grid may have noise or partial shapes, but validation strictly rejects if any cell outside pattern (and not trigger) is non-zero; output ignores input values except for triggering and validation.
 * All considerations: Shapes are exact sets of relative (di,dj) positions; no rotation, scaling, or variable sizes; output is always n x n with 0s where no pattern fills; potential for multiple triggers in one block if not validated properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def get_type_color(v: int) -> tp.Tuple[tp.Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2: return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3: return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5: return 'z', 6
    if v == 7: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    if v == 8: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This maps triggers to shape type and fill color; essential for identification.)

            s.add((3, k))
        s.add((1, 0))
        s.add((1, 3))
        s.add((2, 0))
        s.add((2, 3))
        return s
    elif typ == 'diamond':
        return set([(0,1),(0,2),(3,1),(3,2),(1,0),(1,3),(2,0),(2,3)])
    elif typ == 'z':
        return set([(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)])
    elif typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return set([(0,0),(0,3),(3,0),(3,3),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)])
    return set()
```
(This defines exact 4x4 relative positions per shape; core for validation and filling; accurate for training cases.)

        for dj in range(4):
            if g[i + di][j + dj] != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid input containing "seeds" (specific numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that represent starting points or partial forms of letter-like shapes (H, U, Z, O) in 4x4 blocks, where the goal is to detect these seeds—either isolated or already partially matching the shape—and complete or redraw the full shape in the output grid using a mapped "color" value (e.g., 1 for H shapes). The output transforms the input by filling in these standardized patterns while clearing non-pattern areas in the 4x4 block, effectively rendering a completed version of the intended shapes without altering unrelated parts of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are strictly 4x4 and anchored at the seed position (r, c), with patterns defined as specific coordinate lists (e.g., H uses corners and middle crossbars; U is a U-shape; Z is diagonal-step; O is a hollow square/ring).
 * Only specific seed values are handled (1→H color 1; 2→U color 4; 3→H color 1; 5→Z color 6; 7→O color 7; 8→O color 7); unrecognized numbers or positions out of 4x4 bounds are ignored.
 * Detection logic: A shape is drawn if the seed is "isolated" (4x4 block empty except seed) OR if the block already exactly matches the pattern (all pattern positions filled with target color, non-pattern positions empty except possibly the seed).
 * Subtlety: The seed itself (at (0,0) relative) is treated specially in matching—non-pattern checks exclude it to allow partial inputs, but isolation strictly requires the entire 4x4 empty except seed; this can miss partially filled shapes that aren't exact matches.
 * Bounds checking is critical: Any pattern position or check extending beyond grid size (size x size) skips or fails the shape.
 * Overlaps aren't prevented: Multiple seeds can draw into the same output cells, potentially overwriting with the last-processed color (order is row-major scan).
 * Clearing: draw_shape zeros non-pattern cells in the 4x4 block, which could erase parts of adjacent or overlapping input elements if not careful.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so large grids allow multiple non-overlapping shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Input may have pre-filled partial shapes that need exact matching (not just presence of seed color), and isolation is a fallback only for empty blocks; also, colors in input must match the target for pattern verification.
 * No rotation/reflection: Patterns are fixed orientation.
 * Output starts as all zeros, only modified where shapes are drawn; unchanged input areas remain zeroed if processed.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds or exact pattern matches and drawing the corresponding shapes/colors without errors.
 * What worked: Pattern definitions captured core H/U/Z/O forms; isolation fallback allowed empty-block seeds to trigger drawing; matching ensured partial/exact shapes were recognized and redrawn consistently; bounds checking prevented crashes on edge seeds.
 * What didn't work: Potential for overwriting in overlaps (e.g., if seeds are adjacent, later draws zero non-pattern areas, possibly erasing prior shapes); H pattern may be incomplete (lacks full verticals, leading to partial H's); no handling for seeds outside mapped values (silently ignored, which is correct but could miss puzzle variants); strict exact-match requirement might fail on "close but not exact" partials.
 * The main program loop scans every cell as a potential seed, which is efficient but processes even non-seeds (skipped quickly).
 * No extraction of full objects; relies on local 4x4 checks, which works for non-overlapping shapes but may fail if shapes overlap or span larger areas.
 * Training examples all passed, indicating solid understanding of isolated/exact detection and drawing, but no details on what training inputs looked like (e.g., partial vs. empty blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 20x20 grid (inferred from 20-element rows x 20 rows, with top/bottom rows all zeros), primarily filled with 7's in repeating 4x4 blocks forming H-like and O-like patterns across rows 1-17, with a large zeroed central area (columns ~8-15 in middle rows) and some incomplete or truncated shapes (e.g., row 5 has partial H's then zeros; rows 9-13 show staggered 7's that look like incomplete O's or misaligned H's).
 * It makes partial sense: The 7's form coherent H patterns in blocks (e.g., columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., in rows 1-4 match H verticals/crossbar), and O-like rings appear in places (e.g., rows 9-12, columns 8-11), suggesting the input had multiple 7/8 seeds triggering O/H draws with color 7; the zeroed areas indicate clearing of non-pattern cells, and borders are untouched (all zeros).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some patterns appear truncated or asymmetric (e.g., row 9: [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] suggests a missing left H vertical and isolated 7's that don't form complete 4x4 shapes; row 13 has [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] with gaps that might indicate failed bounds/isolation checks or overlapping clears erasing parts). Expected output should have cleaner, non-overlapping full shapes without stray 7's or zeroed intrusions into pattern areas—differences likely due to adjacent seeds causing draw_shape to zero neighboring cells unexpectedly, or H pattern definition missing positions (e.g., no (0,0)/(3,0) for full H verticals). The central zero block (rows 5-8, columns 8-19) looks like over-clearing, possibly from a seed that matched but zeroed a larger area; without input, unclear if this matches expected (e.g., if input had clustered seeds), but it deviates from ideal isolated shape renders seen in training success.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 20:27:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detection and rendering of specific 4x4 tetromino-like patterns (rectangle border, diamond, Z-shape, anti-diamond) in a larger grid, triggered by seed values (2 for rectangle, 3 for diamond, 5 for Z, 7/8 for anti-diamond) at the top-left position of each potential block. The output grid fills only the exact pattern positions with a fixed color per type (4 for rectangle, 1 for diamond, 6 for Z, 7 for anti-diamond) if the block has no non-zero values outside the pattern (allowing zeros within the pattern and always permitting the seed at (0,0) even if not in the pattern shape), while leaving all other cells as 0; the process scans all possible 4x4 positions, potentially overwriting due to overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are fixed 4x4 shapes: rectangle is a partial border (full top/bottom rows, only edge columns for middle rows); diamond excludes top-left/right but includes mid-top/bottom and side edges; Z is two offset 2x2 blocks; anti-diamond is corners plus center 2x2.
 * Validation (is_valid_block) is asymmetric: it forbids non-zeros outside the pattern but does not require non-zeros inside the pattern (allows sparse inputs); the seed cell (0,0) is always allowed to be non-zero regardless of whether it's in the pattern (critical for diamond, which excludes (0,0)).
 * Only seed values 2,3,5,7,8 trigger detection; 7 and 8 both map to anti-diamond with color 7 (subtle unification, possibly why test has many 7s).
 * Overlaps are handled by later fills overwriting earlier ones, which could cause incomplete or altered patterns in dense grids; no merging or prioritization of blocks.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 20x20 in test), scanning uses range(n-3) for i/j to fit 4x4 blocks; output initializes to all 0s, so undetected areas stay 0.
 * Easy to miss: diamond pattern deliberately omits (0,0), so seed 3 can appear "outside" the shape but still valid; no check for pattern completeness in input (only no extras), leading to "ghost" fills on sparse matches.
 * Subtle: the program assumes top-left seed determines type/color, but doesn't verify if other cells match the seed value or pattern density; potential for false positives if extras are absent but pattern is empty except seed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Set

def get_type_color(v: int) -> Tuple[Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2:
        return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3:
        return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5:
        return 'z', 6
    if v == 7 or v == 8:
        return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This maps input seed values to pattern type and output color; essential for triggering fills.)

```python
def get_rectangle_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    s: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for k in range(4):
        s.add((0, k))
        s.add((3, k))
    s.add((1, 0))
    s.add((1, 3))
    s.add((2, 0))
    s.add((2, 3))
    return s

def get_diamond_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2),
        (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3)
    }

def get_z_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1),
        (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)
    }

def get_anti_diamond_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3),
        (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
    }

def get_pattern_set(typ: str) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if typ == 'rectangle':
        return get_rectangle_pattern()
    if typ == 'diamond':
        return get_diamond_pattern()
    if typ == 'z':
        return get_z_pattern()
    if typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return get_anti_diamond_pattern()
    return set()
```
(These define the exact relative positions for each shape; core to validation and filling; note diamond excludes (0,0).)

```python
def is_valid_block(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    for di in range(4):
        for dj in range(4):
            val = g[i + di][j + dj]
            if val != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False
    return True
```
(This validates no extraneous non-zeros; helpful but incomplete as it doesn't enforce pattern density; key subtlety in skipping (0,0) check.)

```python
def fill_pattern(out: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int) -> None:
    for di, dj in pattern_set:
        out[i + di][j + dj] = color
```
(Straightforward filler for output; essential for rendering detected patterns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects and fills patterns based on top-left seeds for training examples 1-4, demonstrating understanding of shape definitions, validation logic, and color mapping.
 * Worked well for isolated or non-overlapping blocks in training, as all four passed without issues.
 * Potential issue: overwrites from overlapping scans not addressed, which might fragment patterns in denser grids (not a problem in training but could affect test).
 * Validation allows sparse patterns (zeros inside OK), which worked for training but might over-detect if test has minimal seeds without full shapes.
 * No extraction of full objects or merging logic; the scan-and-fill approach is simple but may miss if seeds are not exactly at top-left or if patterns rotate/mirror (assumes fixed orientation).
 * Function get_type_color unifies 7/8 to anti_diamond color 7, which likely handled training variations but could be why test output is uniformly 7-heavy.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (patterns, validation, fill) are relevant and mostly correct, though is_valid_block could be enhanced to require at least the seed non-zero (already implicit).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid mostly with 0s in top/bottom/middle rows and patterned 7s in rows 1-4, 5-8 (partial), 9-12 (broken), 13-16 (sparse), 17-19 all 0s, suggesting multiple adjacent/overlapping anti_diamond fills triggered by 7/8 seeds.
 * It looks partially correct: repeating [7,0,0,7] / [0,7,7,0] motifs match anti_diamond shape (corners + center), appearing in columns 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 16-19, consistent with scanning and filling valid blocks with color 7.
 * Does not look fully correct: middle section (e.g., rows 5-12, columns 8-15) has irregular partial fills like isolated 7s or broken patterns (e.g., row 5: 7s in positions 0,3,4,7 but then 0,0,7,0 and zeros), possibly due to invalid blocks skipped or overwrites creating gaps; expected uniform patterns if input has clean seeds, but appears fragmented—unknown if due to input density, overlaps, or code missing required pattern density checks.
 * Bottom-heavy asymmetry (e.g., row 13 has 7s only in edges, row 14 similar but sparser) differs from top's cleaner repeats, suggesting code detected some but not all blocks (e.g., extras in input blocked validation); without input grid, can't confirm, but it doesn't match a "perfect" tiled output—likely under-fills in complex areas.
 * All-0 rows (0,17-19) make sense if no valid seeds there; overall, output demonstrates core logic but highlights subtlety of overlaps/sparsity not fully handled.

[2025-10-02 20:27:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) at the top-left of potential 4x4 blocks indicate shapes (rectangle, diamond, Z, anti-diamond), and the program must validate the block's content, clear it, and refill only the shape's positions with a corresponding color value, producing a rendered output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only at the top-left (i,j) position; the shape patterns do not always include (0,0) relative to the trigger (e.g., diamond excludes it), but validation allows non-zero at (0,0) even if not in the pattern set.
 * Validation (is_valid) ensures that within the 4x4 block, any non-zero cells (except the trigger at (0,0)) must exactly match positions in the shape's pattern set; extraneous non-zeros outside the pattern invalidate the block.
 * Output clears the entire 4x4 to 0 before filling only the pattern positions with the color, but this is done sequentially in row-major order, so overlapping blocks (common in larger grids) can cause later placements to overwrite earlier ones without merging or prioritization.
 * Grid size is variable (n x n), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so loop only to n-3; empty or invalid blocks remain 0.
 * Colors are hardcoded per trigger: 2=rectangle/4, 3=diamond/1, 5=Z/6, 7/8=anti_diamond/7; no other values trigger anything.
 * Subtlety: Patterns can tile or adjoin without overlap in simple cases (e.g., training), but in dense grids, sequential overwriting distorts shapes; no deduplication or overlap resolution.
 * Easy to miss: The input grid may have noise or partial shapes, but validation strictly rejects if any cell outside pattern (and not trigger) is non-zero; output ignores input values except for triggering and validation.
 * All considerations: Shapes are exact sets of relative (di,dj) positions; no rotation, scaling, or variable sizes; output is always n x n with 0s where no pattern fills; potential for multiple triggers in one block if not validated properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def get_type_color(v: int) -> tp.Tuple[tp.Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2: return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3: return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5: return 'z', 6
    if v == 7: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    if v == 8: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This maps triggers to shape type and fill color; essential for identification.)

```python
def get_pattern_set(typ: str) -> set:
    if typ == 'rectangle':
        s = set()
        for k in range(4):
            s.add((0, k))
            s.add((3, k))
        s.add((1, 0))
        s.add((1, 3))
        s.add((2, 0))
        s.add((2, 3))
        return s
    elif typ == 'diamond':
        return set([(0,1),(0,2),(3,1),(3,2),(1,0),(1,3),(2,0),(2,3)])
    elif typ == 'z':
        return set([(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)])
    elif typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return set([(0,0),(0,3),(3,0),(3,3),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)])
    return set()
```
(This defines exact 4x4 relative positions per shape; core for validation and filling; accurate for training cases.)

```python
def is_valid(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: set) -> bool:
    for di in range(4):
        for dj in range(4):
            if g[i + di][j + dj] != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False
    return True
```
(This validates a 4x4 block by checking non-zeros align with pattern or trigger; works well but assumes no pre-clearing of input.)

(The main program loop iterates possible top-lefts, applies type/color, validates, clears output 4x4, and fills pattern; helpful structure but lacks overlap handling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid understanding of single-block shape detection, validation, and filling for isolated or non-overlapping cases.
 * What worked: Trigger mapping, pattern sets, and validation logic perfectly matched training inputs, producing correct outputs without distortion.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for overlapping 4x4 blocks in larger grids; sequential processing overwrites prior fills, potentially corrupting adjacent or tiled shapes (e.g., in test, irregular patterns suggest overwrite artifacts).
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond scanning for triggers; assumes all shapes are axis-aligned 4x4 starting at integer positions, which works for training but may miss shifted or merged shapes.
 * The clearing step (set output 4x4 to 0 before filling) prevents input bleed but exacerbates overwrite issues in dense grids.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, as all provided are relevant; however, the main loop's lack of prioritization (e.g., process in reverse order or merge fills) is a gap for complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 20x20 grid with top/bottom rows all 0s (expected for boundary), and middle rows showing repeated 7-0 patterns resembling tiled anti-diamonds (e.g., rows 1,4,9,12,13,17 have [7,0,0,7,...] motifs), but with irregularities like row 5's partial disruptions (e.g., 0,0,7,0 in positions 8-11) and row 10's mixes (e.g., 0,7,7,0 but then 0,0,7,0), suggesting overlapping triggers where later anti_diamonds (color 7) overwrote parts of earlier ones.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should render clean, non-overlapping or merged shapes without distortions, but observed effects show jagged or incomplete lines (e.g., row 6 has 7s in expected diamond-like spots but cuts off mid-pattern around columns 8-16), differing from a uniform tiling; this is likely due to sequential overwriting, as training (smaller/simpler?) had no such overlaps.
 * The all-0 borders make sense (no room for full 4x4), but internal patterns are denser than isolated shapes, implying test input has many adjacent 7/8 triggers; output fails to preserve all shape integrity, e.g., row 11's [0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,...] shows mismatched fills vs. pure anti_diamond sets.
 * Unknown why some areas (e.g., columns 12-15 in rows 5-9) are mostly 0s amid 7s—possibly invalid blocks or overwrite to 0—but it disrupts expected continuity; overall, test output demonstrates partial success (patterns emerge) but not precision, confirming overlap as the key flaw.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detection and rendering of specific 4x4 tetromino-like patterns (rectangle border, diamond, Z-shape, anti-diamond) in a larger grid, triggered by seed values (2 for rectangle, 3 for diamond, 5 for Z, 7/8 for anti-diamond) at the top-left position of each potential block. The output grid fills only the exact pattern positions with a fixed color per type (4 for rectangle, 1 for diamond, 6 for Z, 7 for anti-diamond) if the block has no non-zero values outside the pattern (allowing zeros within the pattern and always permitting the seed at (0,0) even if not in the pattern shape), while leaving all other cells as 0; the process scans all possible 4x4 positions, potentially overwriting due to overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are fixed 4x4 shapes: rectangle is a partial border (full top/bottom rows, only edge columns for middle rows); diamond excludes top-left/right but includes mid-top/bottom and side edges; Z is two offset 2x2 blocks; anti-diamond is corners plus center 2x2.
 * Validation (is_valid_block) is asymmetric: it forbids non-zeros outside the pattern but does not require non-zeros inside the pattern (allows sparse inputs); the seed cell (0,0) is always allowed to be non-zero regardless of whether it's in the pattern (critical for diamond, which excludes (0,0)).
 * Only seed values 2,3,5,7,8 trigger detection; 7 and 8 both map to anti-diamond with color 7 (subtle unification, possibly why test has many 7s).
 * Overlaps are handled by later fills overwriting earlier ones, which could cause incomplete or altered patterns in dense grids; no merging or prioritization of blocks.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 20x20 in test), scanning uses range(n-3) for i/j to fit 4x4 blocks; output initializes to all 0s, so undetected areas stay 0.
 * Easy to miss: diamond pattern deliberately omits (0,0), so seed 3 can appear "outside" the shape but still valid; no check for pattern completeness in input (only no extras), leading to "ghost" fills on sparse matches.
 * Subtle: the program assumes top-left seed determines type/color, but doesn't verify if other cells match the seed value or pattern density; potential for false positives if extras are absent but pattern is empty except seed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Set

def get_type_color(v: int) -> Tuple[Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2:
        return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3:
        return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5:
        return 'z', 6
    if v == 7 or v == 8:
        return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This maps input seed values to pattern type and output color; essential for triggering fills.)

```python
def get_rectangle_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    s: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for k in range(4):
        s.add((0, k))
        s.add((3, k))
    s.add((1, 0))
    s.add((1, 3))
    s.add((2, 0))
    s.add((2, 3))
    return s

def get_diamond_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2),
        (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3)
    }

def get_z_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1),
        (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)
    }

def get_anti_diamond_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3),
        (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
    }

def get_pattern_set(typ: str) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if typ == 'rectangle':
        return get_rectangle_pattern()
    if typ == 'diamond':
        return get_diamond_pattern()
    if typ == 'z':
        return get_z_pattern()
    if typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return get_anti_diamond_pattern()
    return set()
```
(These define the exact relative positions for each shape; core to validation and filling; note diamond excludes (0,0).)

```python
def is_valid_block(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    for di in range(4):
        for dj in range(4):
            val = g[i + di][j + dj]
            if val != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False
    return True
```
(This validates no extraneous non-zeros; helpful but incomplete as it doesn't enforce pattern density; key subtlety in skipping (0,0) check.)

```python
def fill_pattern(out: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int) -> None:
    for di, dj in pattern_set:
        out[i + di][j + dj] = color
```
(Straightforward filler for output; essential for rendering detected patterns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects and fills patterns based on top-left seeds for training examples 1-4, demonstrating understanding of shape definitions, validation logic, and color mapping.
 * Worked well for isolated or non-overlapping blocks in training, as all four passed without issues.
 * Potential issue: overwrites from overlapping scans not addressed, which might fragment patterns in denser grids (not a problem in training but could affect test).
 * Validation allows sparse patterns (zeros inside OK), which worked for training but might over-detect if test has minimal seeds without full shapes.
 * No extraction of full objects or merging logic; the scan-and-fill approach is simple but may miss if seeds are not exactly at top-left or if patterns rotate/mirror (assumes fixed orientation).
 * Function get_type_color unifies 7/8 to anti_diamond color 7, which likely handled training variations but could be why test output is uniformly 7-heavy.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (patterns, validation, fill) are relevant and mostly correct, though is_valid_block could be enhanced to require at least the seed non-zero (already implicit).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid mostly with 0s in top/bottom/middle rows and patterned 7s in rows 1-4, 5-8 (partial), 9-12 (broken), 13-16 (sparse), 17-19 all 0s, suggesting multiple adjacent/overlapping anti_diamond fills triggered by 7/8 seeds.
 * It looks partially correct: repeating [7,0,0,7] / [0,7,7,0] motifs match anti_diamond shape (corners + center), appearing in columns 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 16-19, consistent with scanning and filling valid blocks with color 7.
 * Does not look fully correct: middle section (e.g., rows 5-12, columns 8-15) has irregular partial fills like isolated 7s or broken patterns (e.g., row 5: 7s in positions 0,3,4,7 but then 0,0,7,0 and zeros), possibly due to invalid blocks skipped or overwrites creating gaps; expected uniform patterns if input has clean seeds, but appears fragmented—unknown if due to input density, overlaps, or code missing required pattern density checks.
 * Bottom-heavy asymmetry (e.g., row 13 has 7s only in edges, row 14 similar but sparser) differs from top's cleaner repeats, suggesting code detected some but not all blocks (e.g., extras in input blocked validation); without input grid, can't confirm, but it doesn't match a "perfect" tiled output—likely under-fills in complex areas.
 * All-0 rows (0,17-19) make sense if no valid seeds there; overall, output demonstrates core logic but highlights subtlety of overlaps/sparsity not fully handled.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid input containing "seeds" (specific numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that represent starting points or partial forms of letter-like shapes (H, U, Z, O) in 4x4 blocks, where the goal is to detect these seeds—either isolated or already partially matching the shape—and complete or redraw the full shape in the output grid using a mapped "color" value (e.g., 1 for H shapes). The output transforms the input by filling in these standardized patterns while clearing non-pattern areas in the 4x4 block, effectively rendering a completed version of the intended shapes without altering unrelated parts of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are strictly 4x4 and anchored at the seed position (r, c), with patterns defined as specific coordinate lists (e.g., H uses corners and middle crossbars; U is a U-shape; Z is diagonal-step; O is a hollow square/ring).
 * Only specific seed values are handled (1→H color 1; 2→U color 4; 3→H color 1; 5→Z color 6; 7→O color 7; 8→O color 7); unrecognized numbers or positions out of 4x4 bounds are ignored.
 * Detection logic: A shape is drawn if the seed is "isolated" (4x4 block empty except seed) OR if the block already exactly matches the pattern (all pattern positions filled with target color, non-pattern positions empty except possibly the seed).
 * Subtlety: The seed itself (at (0,0) relative) is treated specially in matching—non-pattern checks exclude it to allow partial inputs, but isolation strictly requires the entire 4x4 empty except seed; this can miss partially filled shapes that aren't exact matches.
 * Bounds checking is critical: Any pattern position or check extending beyond grid size (size x size) skips or fails the shape.
 * Overlaps aren't prevented: Multiple seeds can draw into the same output cells, potentially overwriting with the last-processed color (order is row-major scan).
 * Clearing: draw_shape zeros non-pattern cells in the 4x4 block, which could erase parts of adjacent or overlapping input elements if not careful.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so large grids allow multiple non-overlapping shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Input may have pre-filled partial shapes that need exact matching (not just presence of seed color), and isolation is a fallback only for empty blocks; also, colors in input must match the target for pattern verification.
 * No rotation/reflection: Patterns are fixed orientation.
 * Output starts as all zeros, only modified where shapes are drawn; unchanged input areas remain zeroed if processed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds or exact pattern matches and drawing the corresponding shapes/colors without errors.
 * What worked: Pattern definitions captured core H/U/Z/O forms; isolation fallback allowed empty-block seeds to trigger drawing; matching ensured partial/exact shapes were recognized and redrawn consistently; bounds checking prevented crashes on edge seeds.
 * What didn't work: Potential for overwriting in overlaps (e.g., if seeds are adjacent, later draws zero non-pattern areas, possibly erasing prior shapes); H pattern may be incomplete (lacks full verticals, leading to partial H's); no handling for seeds outside mapped values (silently ignored, which is correct but could miss puzzle variants); strict exact-match requirement might fail on "close but not exact" partials.
 * The main program loop scans every cell as a potential seed, which is efficient but processes even non-seeds (skipped quickly).
 * No extraction of full objects; relies on local 4x4 checks, which works for non-overlapping shapes but may fail if shapes overlap or span larger areas.
 * Training examples all passed, indicating solid understanding of isolated/exact detection and drawing, but no details on what training inputs looked like (e.g., partial vs. empty blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 20x20 grid (inferred from 20-element rows x 20 rows, with top/bottom rows all zeros), primarily filled with 7's in repeating 4x4 blocks forming H-like and O-like patterns across rows 1-17, with a large zeroed central area (columns ~8-15 in middle rows) and some incomplete or truncated shapes (e.g., row 5 has partial H's then zeros; rows 9-13 show staggered 7's that look like incomplete O's or misaligned H's).
 * It makes partial sense: The 7's form coherent H patterns in blocks (e.g., columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., in rows 1-4 match H verticals/crossbar), and O-like rings appear in places (e.g., rows 9-12, columns 8-11), suggesting the input had multiple 7/8 seeds triggering O/H draws with color 7; the zeroed areas indicate clearing of non-pattern cells, and borders are untouched (all zeros).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some patterns appear truncated or asymmetric (e.g., row 9: [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] suggests a missing left H vertical and isolated 7's that don't form complete 4x4 shapes; row 13 has [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] with gaps that might indicate failed bounds/isolation checks or overlapping clears erasing parts). Expected output should have cleaner, non-overlapping full shapes without stray 7's or zeroed intrusions into pattern areas—differences likely due to adjacent seeds causing draw_shape to zero neighboring cells unexpectedly, or H pattern definition missing positions (e.g., no (0,0)/(3,0) for full H verticals). The central zero block (rows 5-8, columns 8-19) looks like over-clearing, possibly from a seed that matched but zeroed a larger area; without input, unclear if this matches expected (e.g., if input had clustered seeds), but it deviates from ideal isolated shape renders seen in training success.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-10-02 20:39:39] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing specific numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that act as "starters" for distinct 4x4 patterns (rectangle, diamond, Z-shape, anti-diamond), where the program must validate the local 4x4 area for no extraneous non-zeros outside the expected pattern positions (allowing zeros within the pattern) and then fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with a type-specific color. The goal is to detect and render these patterns without interference, handling potential overlaps in filling by overwriting with the detected color, across grids up to 20x20.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are anchored at the starter position (i,j) where the input value v matches a type, but validation allows the starter at (0,0) relative even if not explicitly in the pattern set (e.g., diamond does not include (0,0) in its fill set, but the check skips strict enforcement there).
 * Validation (is_valid) only fails if there are non-zeros in the 4x4 outside the pattern set and not the starter; it permits incomplete patterns in input (zeros in expected positions) but fills the full pattern in output if valid.
 * Filling happens in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), so overlaps in output are resolved by later patterns overwriting earlier ones with their color (all examples use color 7 for anti-diamond, so no visible conflict).
 * Subtleties include handling adjacent or near-adjacent starters (e.g., every 4 columns) without invalidating each other if their 4x4 areas don't introduce extras; patterns like anti-diamond have sparse fills (e.g., no fill at relative (0,1) or (0,2)), leading to "gaps" that might look isolated but are part of valid placements.
 * Grid edges: Loops go to n-3 to avoid out-of-bounds, but 20x20 allows placements up to i/j=16; empty areas (all 0s) in output indicate no valid starters or invalid placements there.
 * No handling for v=0 or other values: They are ignored (return None,0), so output starts all 0s and only fills where patterns are detected.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping input structures might cause is_valid to fail for some starters due to "extraneous" non-zeros from adjacent patterns; diamond's exclusion of (0,0) from fill set means starters aren't colored in output unless overlapped by another pattern.
 * Color mapping is fixed: 2->rectangle/color4, 3->diamond/color1, 5->Z/color6, 7/8->anti-diamond/color7; no other v types.
 * All training examples passed, suggesting core detection/fill logic works for isolated or simple arrangements, but test may involve denser/complex layouts (e.g., frames or partial sections).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Set, Tuple, Optional

def get_type_color(v: int) -> Tuple[Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2:
        return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3:
        return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5:
        return 'z', 6
    if v == 7 or v == 8:
        return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This mapping function is essential and correct for associating input values to pattern types and output colors.)

```python
def get_pattern_set(typ: str) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if typ == 'rectangle':
        s: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
        for k in range(4):
            s.add((0, k))
            s.add((3, k))
        s.add((1, 0))
        s.add((1, 3))
        s.add((2, 0))
        s.add((2, 3))
        return s
    elif typ == 'diamond':
        return {
            (0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2),
            (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3)
        }
    elif typ == 'z':
        return {
            (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1),
            (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)
        }
    elif typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return {
            (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3),
            (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
        }
    return set()
```
(This correctly defines the exact relative positions for each pattern type; sets enable fast lookups. Note: diamond excludes (0,0), which is intentional but subtle.)

```python
def is_valid(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    for di in range(4):
        for dj in range(4):
            if g[i + di][j + dj] != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False
    return True
```
(This validation is key and working well for training; it leniently allows incomplete input patterns but blocks on extras. Subtle: skips check for (0,0) even if not in set.)

```python
def fill_pattern(out: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int) -> None:
    for di, dj in pattern_set:
        out[i + di][j + dj] = color
```
(Simple but effective fill; overwrites existing output values, which handles overlaps by later placements winning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it successfully passed all 4 training examples, indicating strong understanding of pattern detection, validation, and filling for basic cases (likely isolated or non-overlapping patterns).
 * Worked: Core logic for mapping v to type/color, defining pattern sets, validating local 4x4 for no extras, and filling full patterns in output; handles different types correctly as evidenced by training passes.
 * Didn't work (or potential gaps): No explicit handling for input overlaps causing validation failures; program places full patterns even on minimal input (just starter), which is correct per rules but might overfill in dense tests; no extraction of global objects (e.g., no function to find all potential starters first), relying on brute-force scan which is O(n^2) but fine for 20x20.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (get_type_color, get_pattern_set, is_valid, fill_pattern, program) are relevant and functional—none are broken, though brute-force scan could miss if order matters for overlaps (but training passed).
 * Subtle issue in diamond: Starter position not filled in output (since not in set), which might be intended but could lead to "missing" colors if expected.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense overall and appears correct based on mental simulation of the rules: It shows tiled anti-diamond patterns (color 7) in a frame-like structure around the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 and 13-16 have consistent 7007 / 0770 / 0770 / 7007 repeats every 4 columns), with sparser placements in the middle (e.g., rows 5-12 have gaps like all-0 columns 12-15 and partial extensions like col10=7 in row5 as part of a valid anti-diamond from starter at col7).
 * Specific observed effects: "Isolated" 7s (e.g., row5 col10=7 with neighbors 0) are not errors but correct sparse fills from anti-diamond (relative (0,3) from starter at row5 col7, which also fills row5 col7=7 and inner 7s in rows6-7 cols8-9); no full patterns in middle-right (e.g., row5 cols12-15 all 0, row9 cols4-11 show dense 7s likely from overlapping anti-diamonds or adjacent starters like at row9 col4 / col5 / col8).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Output has non-uniform density (dense frame, sparser/irregular center), which differs from a fully tiled grid but matches if input has starters only in frame areas or middle validations failed due to extras; top/bottom rows (0,17-19) all 0s expected if no starters near edges; no other colors (all 7s) suggests test input uses only 7/8 starters.
 * The output looks correct—no obvious overfills, underfills, or mismatches to pattern shapes; gaps are consistent with anti-diamond sparsity and validation blocking some placements.

[2025-10-02 20:39:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific trigger values (like 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) at the top-left of potential 4x4 blocks indicate shapes (rectangle, diamond, Z, anti-diamond), and the program must validate the block's content, clear it, and refill only the shape's positions with a corresponding color value, producing a rendered output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Triggers are only at the top-left (i,j) position; the shape patterns do not always include (0,0) relative to the trigger (e.g., diamond excludes it), but validation allows non-zero at (0,0) even if not in the pattern set.
 * Validation (is_valid) ensures that within the 4x4 block, any non-zero cells (except the trigger at (0,0)) must exactly match positions in the shape's pattern set; extraneous non-zeros outside the pattern invalidate the block.
 * Output clears the entire 4x4 to 0 before filling only the pattern positions with the color, but this is done sequentially in row-major order, so overlapping blocks (common in larger grids) can cause later placements to overwrite earlier ones without merging or prioritization.
 * Grid size is variable (n x n), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so loop only to n-3; empty or invalid blocks remain 0.
 * Colors are hardcoded per trigger: 2=rectangle/4, 3=diamond/1, 5=Z/6, 7/8=anti_diamond/7; no other values trigger anything.
 * Subtlety: Patterns can tile or adjoin without overlap in simple cases (e.g., training), but in dense grids, sequential overwriting distorts shapes; no deduplication or overlap resolution.
 * Easy to miss: The input grid may have noise or partial shapes, but validation strictly rejects if any cell outside pattern (and not trigger) is non-zero; output ignores input values except for triggering and validation.
 * All considerations: Shapes are exact sets of relative (di,dj) positions; no rotation, scaling, or variable sizes; output is always n x n with 0s where no pattern fills; potential for multiple triggers in one block if not validated properly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
import typing as tp

def get_type_color(v: int) -> tp.Tuple[tp.Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2: return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3: return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5: return 'z', 6
    if v == 7: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    if v == 8: return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This maps triggers to shape type and fill color; essential for identification.)

```python
def get_pattern_set(typ: str) -> set:
    if typ == 'rectangle':
        s = set()
        for k in range(4):
            s.add((0, k))
            s.add((3, k))
        s.add((1, 0))
        s.add((1, 3))
        s.add((2, 0))
        s.add((2, 3))
        return s
    elif typ == 'diamond':
        return set([(0,1),(0,2),(3,1),(3,2),(1,0),(1,3),(2,0),(2,3)])
    elif typ == 'z':
        return set([(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3)])
    elif typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return set([(0,0),(0,3),(3,0),(3,3),(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2)])
    return set()
```
(This defines exact 4x4 relative positions per shape; core for validation and filling; accurate for training cases.)

```python
def is_valid(g: tp.List[tp.List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: set) -> bool:
    for di in range(4):
        for dj in range(4):
            if g[i + di][j + dj] != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False
    return True
```
(This validates a 4x4 block by checking non-zeros align with pattern or trigger; works well but assumes no pre-clearing of input.)

(The main program loop iterates possible top-lefts, applies type/color, validates, clears output 4x4, and fills pattern; helpful structure but lacks overlap handling.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled all 4 training examples, indicating solid understanding of single-block shape detection, validation, and filling for isolated or non-overlapping cases.
 * What worked: Trigger mapping, pattern sets, and validation logic perfectly matched training inputs, producing correct outputs without distortion.
 * What didn't work: No explicit handling for overlapping 4x4 blocks in larger grids; sequential processing overwrites prior fills, potentially corrupting adjacent or tiled shapes (e.g., in test, irregular patterns suggest overwrite artifacts).
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond scanning for triggers; assumes all shapes are axis-aligned 4x4 starting at integer positions, which works for training but may miss shifted or merged shapes.
 * The clearing step (set output 4x4 to 0 before filling) prevents input bleed but exacerbates overwrite issues in dense grids.
 * No unhelpful functions noted, as all provided are relevant; however, the main loop's lack of prioritization (e.g., process in reverse order or merge fills) is a gap for complex cases.

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 20x20 grid with top/bottom rows all 0s (expected for boundary), and middle rows showing repeated 7-0 patterns resembling tiled anti-diamonds (e.g., rows 1,4,9,12,13,17 have [7,0,0,7,...] motifs), but with irregularities like row 5's partial disruptions (e.g., 0,0,7,0 in positions 8-11) and row 10's mixes (e.g., 0,7,7,0 but then 0,0,7,0), suggesting overlapping triggers where later anti_diamonds (color 7) overwrote parts of earlier ones.
 * It does not look fully correct: Expected output should render clean, non-overlapping or merged shapes without distortions, but observed effects show jagged or incomplete lines (e.g., row 6 has 7s in expected diamond-like spots but cuts off mid-pattern around columns 8-16), differing from a uniform tiling; this is likely due to sequential overwriting, as training (smaller/simpler?) had no such overlaps.
 * The all-0 borders make sense (no room for full 4x4), but internal patterns are denser than isolated shapes, implying test input has many adjacent 7/8 triggers; output fails to preserve all shape integrity, e.g., row 11's [0,7,7,0,7,0,0,7,...] shows mismatched fills vs. pure anti_diamond sets.
 * Unknown why some areas (e.g., columns 12-15 in rows 5-9) are mostly 0s amid 7s—possibly invalid blocks or overwrite to 0—but it disrupts expected continuity; overall, test output demonstrates partial success (patterns emerge) but not precision, confirming overlap as the key flaw.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving detection and rendering of specific 4x4 tetromino-like patterns (rectangle border, diamond, Z-shape, anti-diamond) in a larger grid, triggered by seed values (2 for rectangle, 3 for diamond, 5 for Z, 7/8 for anti-diamond) at the top-left position of each potential block. The output grid fills only the exact pattern positions with a fixed color per type (4 for rectangle, 1 for diamond, 6 for Z, 7 for anti-diamond) if the block has no non-zero values outside the pattern (allowing zeros within the pattern and always permitting the seed at (0,0) even if not in the pattern shape), while leaving all other cells as 0; the process scans all possible 4x4 positions, potentially overwriting due to overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are fixed 4x4 shapes: rectangle is a partial border (full top/bottom rows, only edge columns for middle rows); diamond excludes top-left/right but includes mid-top/bottom and side edges; Z is two offset 2x2 blocks; anti-diamond is corners plus center 2x2.
 * Validation (is_valid_block) is asymmetric: it forbids non-zeros outside the pattern but does not require non-zeros inside the pattern (allows sparse inputs); the seed cell (0,0) is always allowed to be non-zero regardless of whether it's in the pattern (critical for diamond, which excludes (0,0)).
 * Only seed values 2,3,5,7,8 trigger detection; 7 and 8 both map to anti-diamond with color 7 (subtle unification, possibly why test has many 7s).
 * Overlaps are handled by later fills overwriting earlier ones, which could cause incomplete or altered patterns in dense grids; no merging or prioritization of blocks.
 * Grid size is variable (e.g., 20x20 in test), scanning uses range(n-3) for i/j to fit 4x4 blocks; output initializes to all 0s, so undetected areas stay 0.
 * Easy to miss: diamond pattern deliberately omits (0,0), so seed 3 can appear "outside" the shape but still valid; no check for pattern completeness in input (only no extras), leading to "ghost" fills on sparse matches.
 * Subtle: the program assumes top-left seed determines type/color, but doesn't verify if other cells match the seed value or pattern density; potential for false positives if extras are absent but pattern is empty except seed.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Optional, Set

def get_type_color(v: int) -> Tuple[Optional[str], int]:
    if v == 2:
        return 'rectangle', 4
    if v == 3:
        return 'diamond', 1
    if v == 5:
        return 'z', 6
    if v == 7 or v == 8:
        return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This maps input seed values to pattern type and output color; essential for triggering fills.)

```python
def get_rectangle_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    s: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
    for k in range(4):
        s.add((0, k))
        s.add((3, k))
    s.add((1, 0))
    s.add((1, 3))
    s.add((2, 0))
    s.add((2, 3))
    return s

def get_diamond_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2),
        (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3)
    }

def get_z_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1),
        (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)
    }

def get_anti_diamond_pattern() -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    return {
        (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3),
        (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
    }

def get_pattern_set(typ: str) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if typ == 'rectangle':
        return get_rectangle_pattern()
    if typ == 'diamond':
        return get_diamond_pattern()
    if typ == 'z':
        return get_z_pattern()
    if typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return get_anti_diamond_pattern()
    return set()
```
(These define the exact relative positions for each shape; core to validation and filling; note diamond excludes (0,0).)

```python
def is_valid_block(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    for di in range(4):
        for dj in range(4):
            val = g[i + di][j + dj]
            if val != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False
    return True
```
(This validates no extraneous non-zeros; helpful but incomplete as it doesn't enforce pattern density; key subtlety in skipping (0,0) check.)

```python
def fill_pattern(out: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int) -> None:
    for di, dj in pattern_set:
        out[i + di][j + dj] = color
```
(Straightforward filler for output; essential for rendering detected patterns.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly detects and fills patterns based on top-left seeds for training examples 1-4, demonstrating understanding of shape definitions, validation logic, and color mapping.
 * Worked well for isolated or non-overlapping blocks in training, as all four passed without issues.
 * Potential issue: overwrites from overlapping scans not addressed, which might fragment patterns in denser grids (not a problem in training but could affect test).
 * Validation allows sparse patterns (zeros inside OK), which worked for training but might over-detect if test has minimal seeds without full shapes.
 * No extraction of full objects or merging logic; the scan-and-fill approach is simple but may miss if seeds are not exactly at top-left or if patterns rotate/mirror (assumes fixed orientation).
 * Function get_type_color unifies 7/8 to anti_diamond color 7, which likely handled training variations but could be why test output is uniformly 7-heavy.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (patterns, validation, fill) are relevant and mostly correct, though is_valid_block could be enhanced to require at least the seed non-zero (already implicit).

**Test output:**
 * The test output generates a 20x20 grid mostly with 0s in top/bottom/middle rows and patterned 7s in rows 1-4, 5-8 (partial), 9-12 (broken), 13-16 (sparse), 17-19 all 0s, suggesting multiple adjacent/overlapping anti_diamond fills triggered by 7/8 seeds.
 * It looks partially correct: repeating [7,0,0,7] / [0,7,7,0] motifs match anti_diamond shape (corners + center), appearing in columns 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 16-19, consistent with scanning and filling valid blocks with color 7.
 * Does not look fully correct: middle section (e.g., rows 5-12, columns 8-15) has irregular partial fills like isolated 7s or broken patterns (e.g., row 5: 7s in positions 0,3,4,7 but then 0,0,7,0 and zeros), possibly due to invalid blocks skipped or overwrites creating gaps; expected uniform patterns if input has clean seeds, but appears fragmented—unknown if due to input density, overlaps, or code missing required pattern density checks.
 * Bottom-heavy asymmetry (e.g., row 13 has 7s only in edges, row 14 similar but sparser) differs from top's cleaner repeats, suggesting code detected some but not all blocks (e.g., extras in input blocked validation); without input grid, can't confirm, but it doesn't match a "perfect" tiled output—likely under-fills in complex areas.
 * All-0 rows (0,17-19) make sense if no valid seeds there; overall, output demonstrates core logic but highlights subtlety of overlaps/sparsity not fully handled.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle appears to involve processing a grid input containing "seeds" (specific numbers like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that represent starting points or partial forms of letter-like shapes (H, U, Z, O) in 4x4 blocks, where the goal is to detect these seeds—either isolated or already partially matching the shape—and complete or redraw the full shape in the output grid using a mapped "color" value (e.g., 1 for H shapes). The output transforms the input by filling in these standardized patterns while clearing non-pattern areas in the 4x4 block, effectively rendering a completed version of the intended shapes without altering unrelated parts of the grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Shapes are strictly 4x4 and anchored at the seed position (r, c), with patterns defined as specific coordinate lists (e.g., H uses corners and middle crossbars; U is a U-shape; Z is diagonal-step; O is a hollow square/ring).
 * Only specific seed values are handled (1→H color 1; 2→U color 4; 3→H color 1; 5→Z color 6; 7→O color 7; 8→O color 7); unrecognized numbers or positions out of 4x4 bounds are ignored.
 * Detection logic: A shape is drawn if the seed is "isolated" (4x4 block empty except seed) OR if the block already exactly matches the pattern (all pattern positions filled with target color, non-pattern positions empty except possibly the seed).
 * Subtlety: The seed itself (at (0,0) relative) is treated specially in matching—non-pattern checks exclude it to allow partial inputs, but isolation strictly requires the entire 4x4 empty except seed; this can miss partially filled shapes that aren't exact matches.
 * Bounds checking is critical: Any pattern position or check extending beyond grid size (size x size) skips or fails the shape.
 * Overlaps aren't prevented: Multiple seeds can draw into the same output cells, potentially overwriting with the last-processed color (order is row-major scan).
 * Clearing: draw_shape zeros non-pattern cells in the 4x4 block, which could erase parts of adjacent or overlapping input elements if not careful.
 * Grid size varies (e.g., 20x20 in test), but patterns are fixed 4x4, so large grids allow multiple non-overlapping shapes.
 * Easy to miss: Input may have pre-filled partial shapes that need exact matching (not just presence of seed color), and isolation is a fallback only for empty blocks; also, colors in input must match the target for pattern verification.
 * No rotation/reflection: Patterns are fixed orientation.
 * Output starts as all zeros, only modified where shapes are drawn; unchanged input areas remain zeroed if processed.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the primary (and only detailed) attempt shown; it successfully handled all 4 training examples by correctly detecting isolated seeds or exact pattern matches and drawing the corresponding shapes/colors without errors.
 * What worked: Pattern definitions captured core H/U/Z/O forms; isolation fallback allowed empty-block seeds to trigger drawing; matching ensured partial/exact shapes were recognized and redrawn consistently; bounds checking prevented crashes on edge seeds.
 * What didn't work: Potential for overwriting in overlaps (e.g., if seeds are adjacent, later draws zero non-pattern areas, possibly erasing prior shapes); H pattern may be incomplete (lacks full verticals, leading to partial H's); no handling for seeds outside mapped values (silently ignored, which is correct but could miss puzzle variants); strict exact-match requirement might fail on "close but not exact" partials.
 * The main program loop scans every cell as a potential seed, which is efficient but processes even non-seeds (skipped quickly).
 * No extraction of full objects; relies on local 4x4 checks, which works for non-overlapping shapes but may fail if shapes overlap or span larger areas.
 * Training examples all passed, indicating solid understanding of isolated/exact detection and drawing, but no details on what training inputs looked like (e.g., partial vs. empty blocks).

**Test output:**
 * The test output is a 20x20 grid (inferred from 20-element rows x 20 rows, with top/bottom rows all zeros), primarily filled with 7's in repeating 4x4 blocks forming H-like and O-like patterns across rows 1-17, with a large zeroed central area (columns ~8-15 in middle rows) and some incomplete or truncated shapes (e.g., row 5 has partial H's then zeros; rows 9-13 show staggered 7's that look like incomplete O's or misaligned H's).
 * It makes partial sense: The 7's form coherent H patterns in blocks (e.g., columns 0-3, 4-7, etc., in rows 1-4 match H verticals/crossbar), and O-like rings appear in places (e.g., rows 9-12, columns 8-11), suggesting the input had multiple 7/8 seeds triggering O/H draws with color 7; the zeroed areas indicate clearing of non-pattern cells, and borders are untouched (all zeros).
 * However, it does not look fully correct: Some patterns appear truncated or asymmetric (e.g., row 9: [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] suggests a missing left H vertical and isolated 7's that don't form complete 4x4 shapes; row 13 has [7,0,0,7, 0,0,0,0, 0,0,0,0, 7,0,0,7, ...] with gaps that might indicate failed bounds/isolation checks or overlapping clears erasing parts). Expected output should have cleaner, non-overlapping full shapes without stray 7's or zeroed intrusions into pattern areas—differences likely due to adjacent seeds causing draw_shape to zero neighboring cells unexpectedly, or H pattern definition missing positions (e.g., no (0,0)/(3,0) for full H verticals). The central zero block (rows 5-8, columns 8-19) looks like over-clearing, possibly from a seed that matched but zeroed a larger area; without input, unclear if this matches expected (e.g., if input had clustered seeds), but it deviates from ideal isolated shape renders seen in training success.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 9/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing an input grid containing specific numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 8) that act as "starters" for distinct 4x4 patterns (rectangle, diamond, Z-shape, anti-diamond), where the program must validate the local 4x4 area for no extraneous non-zeros outside the expected pattern positions (allowing zeros within the pattern) and then fill the corresponding positions in the output grid with a type-specific color. The goal is to detect and render these patterns without interference, handling potential overlaps in filling by overwriting with the detected color, across grids up to 20x20.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Patterns are anchored at the starter position (i,j) where the input value v matches a type, but validation allows the starter at (0,0) relative even if not explicitly in the pattern set (e.g., diamond does not include (0,0) in its fill set, but the check skips strict enforcement there).
 * Validation (is_valid) only fails if there are non-zeros in the 4x4 outside the pattern set and not the starter; it permits incomplete patterns in input (zeros in expected positions) but fills the full pattern in output if valid.
 * Filling happens in row-major order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right), so overlaps in output are resolved by later patterns overwriting earlier ones with their color (all examples use color 7 for anti-diamond, so no visible conflict).
 * Subtleties include handling adjacent or near-adjacent starters (e.g., every 4 columns) without invalidating each other if their 4x4 areas don't introduce extras; patterns like anti-diamond have sparse fills (e.g., no fill at relative (0,1) or (0,2)), leading to "gaps" that might look isolated but are part of valid placements.
 * Grid edges: Loops go to n-3 to avoid out-of-bounds, but 20x20 allows placements up to i/j=16; empty areas (all 0s) in output indicate no valid starters or invalid placements there.
 * No handling for v=0 or other values: They are ignored (return None,0), so output starts all 0s and only fills where patterns are detected.
 * Potential misses: Overlapping input structures might cause is_valid to fail for some starters due to "extraneous" non-zeros from adjacent patterns; diamond's exclusion of (0,0) from fill set means starters aren't colored in output unless overlapped by another pattern.
 * Color mapping is fixed: 2->rectangle/color4, 3->diamond/color1, 5->Z/color6, 7/8->anti-diamond/color7; no other v types.
 * All training examples passed, suggesting core detection/fill logic works for isolated or simple arrangements, but test may involve denser/complex layouts (e.g., frames or partial sections).

from typing import List, Set, Tuple, Optional

def get_type_color(v: int) -> Tuple[Optional[str], int]:

    if v == 3:

    if v == 5:
        return 'z', 6
    if v == 7 or v == 8:
        return 'anti_diamond', 7
    return None, 0
```
(This mapping function is essential and correct for associating input values to pattern types and output colors.)

```python
def get_pattern_set(typ: str) -> Set[Tuple[int, int]]:
    if typ == 'rectangle':
        s: Set[Tuple[int, int]] = set()
        for k in range(4):
            s.add((0, k))
            s.add((3, k))
        s.add((1, 0))
        s.add((1, 3))
        s.add((2, 0))
        s.add((2, 3))
        return s
    elif typ == 'diamond':
        return {
            (0, 1), (0, 2), (3, 1), (3, 2),
            (1, 0), (1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3)
        }
    elif typ == 'z':
        return {
            (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1),
            (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)
        }
    elif typ == 'anti_diamond':
        return {
            (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0), (3, 3),
            (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
        }
    return set()
```
(This correctly defines the exact relative positions for each pattern type; sets enable fast lookups. Note: diamond excludes (0,0), which is intentional but subtle.)

```python
def is_valid(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]]) -> bool:
    for di in range(4):
        for dj in range(4):
            if g[i + di][j + dj] != 0:
                rel = (di, dj)
                if rel != (0, 0) and rel not in pattern_set:
                    return False
    return True
```
(This validation is key and working well for training; it leniently allows incomplete input patterns but blocks on extras. Subtle: skips check for (0,0) even if not in set.)

```python
def fill_pattern(out: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, pattern_set: Set[Tuple[int, int]], color: int) -> None:
    for di, dj in pattern_set:
        out[i + di][j + dj] = color
```
(Simple but effective fill; overwrites existing output values, which handles overlaps by later placements winning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown, but it successfully passed all 4 training examples, indicating strong understanding of pattern detection, validation, and filling for basic cases (likely isolated or non-overlapping patterns).
 * Worked: Core logic for mapping v to type/color, defining pattern sets, validating local 4x4 for no extras, and filling full patterns in output; handles different types correctly as evidenced by training passes.
 * Didn't work (or potential gaps): No explicit handling for input overlaps causing validation failures; program places full patterns even on minimal input (just starter), which is correct per rules but might overfill in dense tests; no extraction of global objects (e.g., no function to find all potential starters first), relying on brute-force scan which is O(n^2) but fine for 20x20.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (get_type_color, get_pattern_set, is_valid, fill_pattern, program) are relevant and functional—none are broken, though brute-force scan could miss if order matters for overlaps (but training passed).
 * Subtle issue in diamond: Starter position not filled in output (since not in set), which might be intended but could lead to "missing" colors if expected.

**Test output:**
 * The test output makes sense overall and appears correct based on mental simulation of the rules: It shows tiled anti-diamond patterns (color 7) in a frame-like structure around the 20x20 grid (e.g., rows 1-4 and 13-16 have consistent 7007 / 0770 / 0770 / 7007 repeats every 4 columns), with sparser placements in the middle (e.g., rows 5-12 have gaps like all-0 columns 12-15 and partial extensions like col10=7 in row5 as part of a valid anti-diamond from starter at col7).
 * Specific observed effects: "Isolated" 7s (e.g., row5 col10=7 with neighbors 0) are not errors but correct sparse fills from anti-diamond (relative (0,3) from starter at row5 col7, which also fills row5 col7=7 and inner 7s in rows6-7 cols8-9); no full patterns in middle-right (e.g., row5 cols12-15 all 0, row9 cols4-11 show dense 7s likely from overlapping anti-diamonds or adjacent starters like at row9 col4 / col5 / col8).
 * Differences from naive expectation: Output has non-uniform density (dense frame, sparser/irregular center), which differs from a fully tiled grid but matches if input has starters only in frame areas or middle validations failed due to extras; top/bottom rows (0,17-19) all 0s expected if no starters near edges; no other colors (all 7s) suggests test input uses only 7/8 starters.
 * The output looks correct—no obvious overfills, underfills, or mismatches to pattern shapes; gaps are consistent with anti-diamond sparsity and validation blocking some placements.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 20:42:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid where specific "trigger" values at certain positions initiate detection of predefined 4x4 shape patterns (like rectangles, diamonds, Z-shapes, and anti-diamonds), and if the surrounding 4x4 block's non-zero cells match the expected pattern positions (allowing the trigger at the top-left regardless), the output grid is filled with a corresponding color value only at those pattern positions. The process scans all possible 4x4 starting positions, potentially leading to overlaps where later fills overwrite earlier ones, transforming the input grid into a colored representation of detected shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Trigger values (e.g., 2 for rectangle, 3 for diamond, 5 for Z, 7 or 8 for anti-diamond) are mapped to specific shapes and output colors (e.g., 4 for rectangle, 1 for diamond, 6 for Z, 7 for anti-diamond); unmapped triggers are ignored.
 * Shape detection is anchored at the top-left of each potential 4x4 block, and validation checks that non-zero values in the input grid appear only in the pattern positions (or at the trigger position (0,0) relative to the start, even if not in the pattern—e.g., diamond pattern excludes (0,0) but allows the trigger there).
 * Patterns are sets of relative (di, dj) positions within 4x4; for example, rectangle covers corners and sides, diamond covers mid-sides excluding corners, Z follows a zigzag, anti-diamond covers corners and center square excluding mid-sides.
 * Output filling only targets the pattern positions with the color, not the trigger position unless it's part of the pattern; overlaps from multiple detections are resolved by the last fill winning (since it directly assigns values).
 * Grid size is n x n (assumed square, e.g., 20x20 for test); scanning is limited to starts where i < n-3 and j < n-3 to fit 4x4 blocks.
 * Subtlety: Input non-zeros outside patterns invalidate a block, but zeros anywhere are fine; this enforces exact shape matching without extras.
 * Easy to miss: Some patterns include the trigger pos (e.g., rectangle, Z, anti_diamond) while others don't (diamond), but validation accommodates this; also, multiple triggers might compete in overlapping blocks, leading to partial or overwritten fills.
 * No extraction of "objects" beyond local 4x4 checks; global grid interactions via overlaps are key.
 * Considerations from attempts: No blob extraction or hole counting needed—purely local pattern matching; unhelpful global searches (e.g., for connected components) would miss the anchored trigger mechanic.

(Note: The main `program` function orchestrates scanning and calling the above; no separate object extraction function is needed or helpful here, as the puzzle relies on local 4x4 validations rather than global object detection.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) correctly handled all 4 training examples, accurately detecting and filling shapes based on triggers and patterns without extraneous non-zero values in blocks.
 * No prior attempts shown, but this one demonstrates core understanding of anchored 4x4 pattern matching and trigger-based coloring.
 * Validation logic correctly accommodates trigger at (0,0) outside some patterns (e.g., diamond), which is essential.
 * Overlap handling via sequential filling (last wins) worked for training but may cause issues in dense test cases with competing shapes.
 * No missed omissions or blob shapes in training; all matched expected outputs.
 * Functions like `get_pattern_positions` and `is_valid_block` are essential for precise matching and should be retained/iterated on.
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided (e.g., no irrelevant extract_objects or hole-counting) are relevant to the local detection mechanic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 20x20 grid with repeating striped patterns of 7s and 0s (e.g., row 1 has 7-0-0-7 repeated 5 times; rows 2-3 have 0-7-7-0 repeated), interspersed with more complex fills in middle rows (e.g., row 5 has partial patterns like 7-0-0-7 then breaks to 0s and a final 7-0-0-7), and all-zero borders (rows 0, 17-19).
 * Without the test input grid provided, it's impossible to mentally verify exact correctness, but the output makes sense as a result of multiple overlapping anti-diamond detections (color 7 dominates, matching the pattern's corner/center fills creating stripe-like visuals) in a larger grid, with some blocks invalidated or overwritten leading to partial fills and zero gaps.
 * It looks plausibly correct for a test input with clustered 7/8 triggers forming anti-diamond chains, but subtle differences could arise if overlaps should prioritize differently or if diamond/Z shapes (colors 1/6) are present but overwritten by later 7-fills— the absence of colors other than 0/7 suggests the test input may lack 2/3/5 triggers or they were invalidated.
 * The output does not look obviously wrong (no random artifacts or full-grid fills), but the zero rows/borders imply no detections near edges, which aligns with the i/j < n-3 scanning limit; however, if the test expects fills wrapping or global adjustments, this would mismatch (unknown without input).
