=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-01 00:33:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    """
    Remove non-background pixels with fewer than 2 same-color 4-neighbors.
    This handles removal of isolated and low-connectivity protrusions.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 00:45:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 00:55:31] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, as seen in both trainings where bg=8 for train1 and bg=0 for train2.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """

    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Identify and remove connected components of non-background pixels smaller than min_size.
    """
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(Helpful for initial noise removal, but min_size=2 in the attempt was too low, removing valid small parts; suggest tuning to 3+ and applying selectively.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Iteratively remove non-background pixels with fewer than threshold same-color 4-neighbors until no changes.

    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

[2025-10-01 00:55:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, as seen in both trainings where bg=8 for train1 and bg=0 for train2.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    """
    Extract connected components of non-bg colors using 4-connectivity flood-fill.
    Returns list of components, each a list of (i, j, color) tuples.
    """
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Identify and remove connected components of non-background pixels smaller than min_size.
    """
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(Helpful for initial noise removal, but min_size=2 in the attempt was too low, removing valid small parts; suggest tuning to 3+ and applying selectively.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Iteratively remove non-background pixels with fewer than threshold same-color 4-neighbors until no changes.
    """
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 01:05:43] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle.

Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem.

[2025-10-01 01:06:48] Response:
### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs only, the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that show the same type of interaction in **both** train examples (i.e., every provided puzzle). No high-level interpretation or solution is implied. Connections are described in terms of direct effects (e.g., one property affecting another), and only those with clear, repeated patterns across both trains are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., stationary 1-pixel Maroon blocks that do not change) are excluded. If a transformation lacks an obvious connected cause (e.g., why pixels are lost), it is noted as unknown rather than explained.

- **Central polyomino-like structure (color: Pink or Red, holes=1, pixels ≈9–20, bbox spans multiple units)** interacts with its own position (bbox minx): A +1 increase in minx (rightward shift of left edge) consistently causes a decrease in pixels (–1 to –2). This structure is the largest non-background component without small standalone traits. No other position property (e.g., miny, maxx, maxy) shows consistent effect across both examples.
  
- **Secondary bar-like or extension structure (color: Blue or Yellow, holes=0 or 1, pixels ≈20–28, bbox horizontal/vertical span)** interacts with its own position (bbox minx or miny): A +1 shift in either minx (rightward) or miny (downward, assuming y increases downward) consistently causes a decrease in pixels (–2 to –3). Direction of shift varies but the position-to-pixel-loss link is consistent. No interaction with other components (e.g., central structure) is obvious.

- **Small clustered Maroon blocks (color: Maroon, holes=0, pixels=2–4, bbox spans 1–2 units horizontally)** interact with their own position (bbox minx): A +1 increase in minx (rightward shift) consistently causes a halving of pixels (e.g., 4→2). These are distinct from 1-pixel Maroon dots, which show no changes. Pixel loss mechanism (e.g., where halved pixels go) is unknown—no consistent link to background or other colors.

No other consistent interactions are identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-position effects, no hole count influencing movement, no cross-component effects like central structure affecting small blocks directly). Background (large Maroon, holes=3) appears only in train 1 and shows pixel gain (+7), but absence in train 2 prevents consistency. Total pixel conservation occurs in train 1 but not train 2, so no consistent global interaction. Test inputs are not analyzed for patterns, as instructions limit to train data for identification.

[2025-10-01 01:06:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                objects.append(component)

(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs only, the following are obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that show the same type of interaction in **both** train examples (i.e., every provided puzzle). No high-level interpretation or solution is implied. Connections are described in terms of direct effects (e.g., one property affecting another), and only those with clear, repeated patterns across both trains are included. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., stationary 1-pixel Maroon blocks that do not change) are excluded. If a transformation lacks an obvious connected cause (e.g., why pixels are lost), it is noted as unknown rather than explained.

- **Central polyomino-like structure (color: Pink or Red, holes=1, pixels ≈9–20, bbox spans multiple units)** interacts with its own position (bbox minx): A +1 increase in minx (rightward shift of left edge) consistently causes a decrease in pixels (–1 to –2). This structure is the largest non-background component without small standalone traits. No other position property (e.g., miny, maxx, maxy) shows consistent effect across both examples.
  
- **Secondary bar-like or extension structure (color: Blue or Yellow, holes=0 or 1, pixels ≈20–28, bbox horizontal/vertical span)** interacts with its own position (bbox minx or miny): A +1 shift in either minx (rightward) or miny (downward, assuming y increases downward) consistently causes a decrease in pixels (–2 to –3). Direction of shift varies but the position-to-pixel-loss link is consistent. No interaction with other components (e.g., central structure) is obvious.

- **Small clustered Maroon blocks (color: Maroon, holes=0, pixels=2–4, bbox spans 1–2 units horizontally)** interact with their own position (bbox minx): A +1 increase in minx (rightward shift) consistently causes a halving of pixels (e.g., 4→2). These are distinct from 1-pixel Maroon dots, which show no changes. Pixel loss mechanism (e.g., where halved pixels go) is unknown—no consistent link to background or other colors.

No other consistent interactions are identifiable (e.g., no reliable color-to-position effects, no hole count influencing movement, no cross-component effects like central structure affecting small blocks directly). Background (large Maroon, holes=3) appears only in train 1 and shows pixel gain (+7), but absence in train 2 prevents consistency. Total pixel conservation occurs in train 1 but not train 2, so no consistent global interaction. Test inputs are not analyzed for patterns, as instructions limit to train data for identification.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 01:22:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties that appear in **every** train puzzle (i.e., both Train 1 and Train 2). I focused solely on changes or relations that are directly observable in the data for both, without speculation, high-level interpretation, or forcing non-existent links. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., fixed small Maroon single-pixel shapes that never change across both, like [7,4,7,4] in Train 2 or [17,6,17,6] in Train 1) are excluded, as they show no interaction. Components without changes or links in both are omitted. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained by consistent data (e.g., exact pixel loss amount varies), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Central/Upper Shape (high-pixel-count component with holes ≥1, e.g., Pink in Train 1, Red in Train 2)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox (position), pixels.  
   - **Interconnection**: Position (bbox x_min) shifts right by +1; this is consistently linked to a decrease in pixels (amount unknown, as -1 in Train 1 vs. -2 in Train 2). No consistent y-shift or holes change.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Occurs for at least one such shape in every train; no color dependency (Pink/Red both exhibit it).

2. **Bottom/Platform Shape (horizontal-ish component at higher y-values, e.g., grouped Red segments in Train 1, Yellow in Train 2)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox (position), pixels.  
   - **Interconnection**: Position (bbox x_min) shifts right by +1 for the overall structure; this is consistently linked to a decrease in pixels (-3 total for Red segments in Train 1 vs. -2 for Yellow in Train 2). In Train 1, this involves reconfiguration/splitting into more sub-components; amount unknown in Train 2.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Always at y ≥12; interacts via position with upper shapes (see #3); no holes change.

3. **Upper Shape Position → Bottom Shape Position (cross-component: Central/Upper to Bottom/Platform)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox x_min (position) of upper shape affects bbox x_min of bottom shape.  
   - **Interconnection**: When the upper shape's x_min shifts right by +1, the bottom shape's x_min also shifts right by +1 (consistent directional effect). Pixel decreases in both are linked but amount unknown. No consistent y or holes effect.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Observed in both trains (Pink/Red upper affects Yellow/Red bottom); suggests positional influence (e.g., alignment or proximity in x), but exact mechanism unknown.

4. **Upper Shape Position → Pixels (self-interaction within Central/Upper Shape)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox y_min (vertical position) and pixels.  
   - **Interconnection**: y_min shifts down by +1, consistently linked to pixel decrease (amount unknown, -3 for Blue in Train 1 vs. -2 for Red in Train 2). x-shift (from #1) compounds the pixel loss. No holes change.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Applies to upper shapes with low initial y_min (<5); no color dependency.

**Unknowns/Non-Consistent Elements**:  
- Background (large full-bbox Maroon in Train 1 only; absent from Train 2 data) shows pixel increase (+7) linked to total losses from other shapes in Train 1, but cannot confirm consistency without Train 2 listing—marked unknown.  
- Small Maroon clusters (e.g., [5,5,6,6] in Train 2 shrinks and shifts right by +1 in x_min, pixels -2): No equivalent change in Train 1 (all small Maroons fixed), so inconsistent—not included.  
- Green/Orange elements (mentioned in description but absent from train data): No interactions observable.  
- Hole count: No consistent changes or links to other properties across both trains (stays same for affected shapes).  
- Color: No consistent effect on movement or transformation (e.g., Pink/Red/Blue/Yellow all shift similarly when positioned upper/central).  

No other connections (e.g., holes → color, silhouettes/edges → movement) are obvious or consistent in every train example. Test inputs were not used for this analysis, as instructions emphasize train consistency only.

[2025-10-01 01:26:05] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1

This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:

                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])

        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]

                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the two train examples, below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between components/properties that appear in **every** train puzzle (i.e., both Train 1 and Train 2). I focused solely on changes or relations that are directly observable in the data for both, without speculation, high-level interpretation, or forcing non-existent links. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., fixed small Maroon single-pixel shapes that never change across both, like [7,4,7,4] in Train 2 or [17,6,17,6] in Train 1) are excluded, as they show no interaction. Components without changes or links in both are omitted. Where a transformation cannot be fully explained by consistent data (e.g., exact pixel loss amount varies), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Central/Upper Shape (high-pixel-count component with holes ≥1, e.g., Pink in Train 1, Red in Train 2)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox (position), pixels.  
   - **Interconnection**: Position (bbox x_min) shifts right by +1; this is consistently linked to a decrease in pixels (amount unknown, as -1 in Train 1 vs. -2 in Train 2). No consistent y-shift or holes change.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Occurs for at least one such shape in every train; no color dependency (Pink/Red both exhibit it).

2. **Bottom/Platform Shape (horizontal-ish component at higher y-values, e.g., grouped Red segments in Train 1, Yellow in Train 2)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox (position), pixels.  
   - **Interconnection**: Position (bbox x_min) shifts right by +1 for the overall structure; this is consistently linked to a decrease in pixels (-3 total for Red segments in Train 1 vs. -2 for Yellow in Train 2). In Train 1, this involves reconfiguration/splitting into more sub-components; amount unknown in Train 2.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Always at y ≥12; interacts via position with upper shapes (see #3); no holes change.

3. **Upper Shape Position → Bottom Shape Position (cross-component: Central/Upper to Bottom/Platform)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox x_min (position) of upper shape affects bbox x_min of bottom shape.  
   - **Interconnection**: When the upper shape's x_min shifts right by +1, the bottom shape's x_min also shifts right by +1 (consistent directional effect). Pixel decreases in both are linked but amount unknown. No consistent y or holes effect.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Observed in both trains (Pink/Red upper affects Yellow/Red bottom); suggests positional influence (e.g., alignment or proximity in x), but exact mechanism unknown.

4. **Upper Shape Position → Pixels (self-interaction within Central/Upper Shape)**  
   - **Properties Involved**: bbox y_min (vertical position) and pixels.  
   - **Interconnection**: y_min shifts down by +1, consistently linked to pixel decrease (amount unknown, -3 for Blue in Train 1 vs. -2 for Red in Train 2). x-shift (from #1) compounds the pixel loss. No holes change.  
   - **Consistency Note**: Applies to upper shapes with low initial y_min (<5); no color dependency.

**Unknowns/Non-Consistent Elements**:  
- Background (large full-bbox Maroon in Train 1 only; absent from Train 2 data) shows pixel increase (+7) linked to total losses from other shapes in Train 1, but cannot confirm consistency without Train 2 listing—marked unknown.  
- Small Maroon clusters (e.g., [5,5,6,6] in Train 2 shrinks and shifts right by +1 in x_min, pixels -2): No equivalent change in Train 1 (all small Maroons fixed), so inconsistent—not included.  
- Green/Orange elements (mentioned in description but absent from train data): No interactions observable.  
- Hole count: No consistent changes or links to other properties across both trains (stays same for affected shapes).  
- Color: No consistent effect on movement or transformation (e.g., Pink/Red/Blue/Yellow all shift similarly when positioned upper/central).  

No other connections (e.g., holes → color, silhouettes/edges → movement) are obvious or consistent in every train example. Test inputs were not used for this analysis, as instructions emphasize train consistency only.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 01:36:48] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

    # ... (code as provided, but over-applies to wrong shapes)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train input/output pairs (the only examples with before/after states for consistency checking), here is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **both** train examples without contradiction. I focused only on properties like position, pixel count, holes, color, and bbox that show direct effects or links between components (e.g., one affecting another's count or position). No high-level solving or assumptions about unlisted elements (e.g., implied solid backgrounds in train 2) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small shape counts that vary, or transformations not seen in both) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., exact reason for pixel loss amounts or why some shifts are x-only vs. y-involved) are noted as such rather than explained.

- **Foreground shapes (e.g., pink, blue, red, yellow polyominoes with holes=1 or holes=0) ↔ Background (large full-bbox shape, e.g., maroon with holes=3 in train 1)**: Pixel counts transfer from foreground to background. Foreground shapes consistently lose pixels (e.g., -1 to -3 per shape in train 1; -2 per shape in train 2), while the background gains pixels by the net total lost from all foregrounds (e.g., +7 total in train 1). This keeps the sum of listed pixels increasing for background but decreasing for foregrounds. (Unknown: exact per-shape loss rule, as amounts vary slightly; consistent only in direction and net transfer.)
  
- **Position (bbox min x/y coordinates) → Foreground shape size (bbox width/height and pixel count)**: Shifts in min x (+1 consistently for shapes with holes=1 like pink/red/yellow in both trains) or min y (+1 for shapes like blue in train 1 or red in train 2) lead to reduced bbox dimensions (width or height decreases by 1 in most cases) and corresponding pixel loss. This interaction affects movement-like changes in all major foreground shapes across both examples. (Unknown: why some shapes shift only x, only y, or both; consistent only in positive direction and resulting size reduction.)

- **Hole count → Shape identity and transformation**: Shapes retain their exact hole count (e.g., holes=1 for pink/red/yellow stays 1; holes=0 for blue/small shapes stays 0; background holes=3 stays 3 in train 1) while undergoing position and pixel changes. This property links to consistent "survival" of the same component without hole alteration, affecting how it interacts with position shifts and pixel loss. (No holes=1 shape gains/loses holes in either train.)

- **Color → Shape persistence**: Individual shape colors do not change (e.g., pink stays pink, red stays red, yellow stays yellow, blue stays blue, maroon stays maroon across both trains), linking color to the ongoing identity of components during position/pixel interactions. This ensures transformations affect properties like pixels and position but not color.

- **Small 1-pixel or low-pixel shapes (e.g., maroon/red dots or bars, often holes=0) ↔ Foreground polyominoes**: These small shapes adjust positions slightly (e.g., x min +1 for a 4-pixel maroon in train 2; scattered red/maroon repositions in train 1) and lose pixels (net -2 to -3 total in smalls for both trains), contributing to the overall foreground pixel loss to background. Their positions seem tied to nearby polyomino bboxes (e.g., near bottom or central areas), affecting minor transformations in the larger shapes' edges or silhouettes. (Unknown: exact repositioning rule for each small shape; consistent only in net pixel loss and minor shifts paralleling polyomino movements.)

No other connections (e.g., color → color, hole count → color, or specific bottom-left/right interactions) are consistent across both train examples, as they either vary (e.g., green/orange not present in train 2) or lack clear effects (e.g., no consistent hole count influencing color or total shape count). Test inputs were not used for interactions, as they lack outputs for comparison.

[2025-10-01 01:38:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

                objects.append(component)

(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True

                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on the provided train input/output pairs (the only examples with before/after states for consistency checking), here is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements/properties. These are limited to patterns that appear in **both** train examples without contradiction. I focused only on properties like position, pixel count, holes, color, and bbox that show direct effects or links between components (e.g., one affecting another's count or position). No high-level solving or assumptions about unlisted elements (e.g., implied solid backgrounds in train 2) are included. Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., specific small shape counts that vary, or transformations not seen in both) are excluded. Unknowns (e.g., exact reason for pixel loss amounts or why some shifts are x-only vs. y-involved) are noted as such rather than explained.

- **Foreground shapes (e.g., pink, blue, red, yellow polyominoes with holes=1 or holes=0) ↔ Background (large full-bbox shape, e.g., maroon with holes=3 in train 1)**: Pixel counts transfer from foreground to background. Foreground shapes consistently lose pixels (e.g., -1 to -3 per shape in train 1; -2 per shape in train 2), while the background gains pixels by the net total lost from all foregrounds (e.g., +7 total in train 1). This keeps the sum of listed pixels increasing for background but decreasing for foregrounds. (Unknown: exact per-shape loss rule, as amounts vary slightly; consistent only in direction and net transfer.)
  
- **Position (bbox min x/y coordinates) → Foreground shape size (bbox width/height and pixel count)**: Shifts in min x (+1 consistently for shapes with holes=1 like pink/red/yellow in both trains) or min y (+1 for shapes like blue in train 1 or red in train 2) lead to reduced bbox dimensions (width or height decreases by 1 in most cases) and corresponding pixel loss. This interaction affects movement-like changes in all major foreground shapes across both examples. (Unknown: why some shapes shift only x, only y, or both; consistent only in positive direction and resulting size reduction.)

- **Hole count → Shape identity and transformation**: Shapes retain their exact hole count (e.g., holes=1 for pink/red/yellow stays 1; holes=0 for blue/small shapes stays 0; background holes=3 stays 3 in train 1) while undergoing position and pixel changes. This property links to consistent "survival" of the same component without hole alteration, affecting how it interacts with position shifts and pixel loss. (No holes=1 shape gains/loses holes in either train.)

- **Color → Shape persistence**: Individual shape colors do not change (e.g., pink stays pink, red stays red, yellow stays yellow, blue stays blue, maroon stays maroon across both trains), linking color to the ongoing identity of components during position/pixel interactions. This ensures transformations affect properties like pixels and position but not color.

- **Small 1-pixel or low-pixel shapes (e.g., maroon/red dots or bars, often holes=0) ↔ Foreground polyominoes**: These small shapes adjust positions slightly (e.g., x min +1 for a 4-pixel maroon in train 2; scattered red/maroon repositions in train 1) and lose pixels (net -2 to -3 total in smalls for both trains), contributing to the overall foreground pixel loss to background. Their positions seem tied to nearby polyomino bboxes (e.g., near bottom or central areas), affecting minor transformations in the larger shapes' edges or silhouettes. (Unknown: exact repositioning rule for each small shape; consistent only in net pixel loss and minor shifts paralleling polyomino movements.)

No other connections (e.g., color → color, hole count → color, or specific bottom-left/right interactions) are consistent across both train examples, as they either vary (e.g., green/orange not present in train 2) or lack clear effects (e.g., no consistent hole count influencing color or total shape count). Test inputs were not used for interactions, as they lack outputs for comparison.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 01:50:53] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to clean up noisy images by identifying the background color, extracting and removing small connected objects (noise), and pruning protrusions or thin extensions from larger objects to reveal clean, main shapes. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected clean versions of shapes like letters or symbols formed by colored pixels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (only up, down, left, right adjacency; no diagonals), same color only.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., min_size=3) by setting them to background.
 * Pruning removes individual cells that have fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), iteratively, to eliminate spikes or thin protrusions, but preserve thick/main body of objects.
 * Iterations in pruning are limited (e.g., max_iters=2-3) to avoid over-eroding large objects.
 * Subtleties: Pruning can disconnect or alter shapes if threshold/iterations are wrong; e.g., it might remove valid parts of irregular shapes like letters with thin arms. Small objects might be part of larger ones if not fully extracted. In examples, shapes like '1', '6', '2', '4', '8' need to be preserved in specific connected forms, but noise (isolated pixels or tiny clusters) must go. Expected outputs often fill in or connect implied shapes subtly (e.g., extending lines in '1' or closing gaps in '8'), suggesting possible need for minor filling or different connectivity. Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), colors are small integers (0-8). Process in stages: background ID -> remove small -> prune, but order matters (pruning after removal prevents re-growth of noise).
 * Easy to miss: Pruning should use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration; over-pruning can remove corners of objects; min_size=3 catches 1-2 pixel noise but might miss valid tiny features; background can be 0 (empty) or other values like 1/8.
 * All attempts so far apply these but fail on shape fidelity; no rotation/flipping, just in-place cleaning.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(Helpful: Correctly identifies most common color as background; used successfully in all examples.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(Helpful: BFS-based connected component labeling for same-color 4-connectivity; essential for identifying objects to remove or analyze; works well but doesn't handle multi-color objects.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(Helpful: Uses extract_objects to remove tiny components; deepcopy prevents side effects; min_size=3 catches common noise but may need tuning for larger noise.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(Helpful in concept: Iteratively removes low-connectivity cells using temp grid; threshold=2 targets protrusions with <2 neighbors; but max_iters=2-3 is too low for complex shapes, leading to incomplete pruning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it applies background detection (works: correctly IDs 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), small object removal (partially works: removes some isolates but misses integrated noise), and protrusion pruning (doesn't work well: leaves jagged edges and doesn't fully clean shapes).
 * Train1: Generated keeps isolated 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) that expected removes or connects; 6's are pruned too aggressively (expected has full row of 6's in row7, but generated has gaps); 2's in rows15-17 are simplified but expected has more connected verticals (e.g., col16 row15/17 missing in generated); overall, shape of '1' (top) is fragmented vs. expected's smoother connections; unknown why row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated (possible over-pruning).
 * Train2: Generated leaves 8's as two separate verticals (rows5-6 cols5-6 and row7 col6), but expected connects them horizontally/vertically with fills (e.g., row4 col6=8 added, row5 col7=8); 4's are mostly kept but expected removes more internals (e.g., row16 col13=4 in generated but 0 in expected, creating hole); 2's are unchanged, matching expected (success there).
 * extract_objects is essential for removal step and works correctly for component sizing.
 * prune_protrusions is helpful but broken in practice: uses current new_g for neighbor checks but temp_g for writes (correct), but threshold=2 removes too many edge cells in irregular shapes; max_iters=3 still insufficient for propagating changes in train1's 1's and 6's; doesn't handle corners well (e.g., removes valid 1-pixel extensions).
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but doesn't catch small protrusions that are part of larger objects (pruning should handle, but fails).
 * Overall attempt shows partial understanding (cleans some noise) but mismatches on shape preservation; no filling of gaps, which expected sometimes implies.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have done minimal cleaning: background=1 correctly identified, but most 6's (rows6-11) and 4's (rows19-21) are left almost intact with only minor prunings (e.g., some 6's in row8 col3-6 removed? Wait, no—generated shows connected 6's but fragmented vs. likely expected clean shapes; row17-18 has 3's kept, but if they are small, should be removed). It looks like over-retention: e.g., the 6-cluster seems like a noisy 'O' or ring but expected probably a solid shape without innards; 4's at bottom look like a '4' with extensions, but generated leaves protrusions (e.g., row21 col7-8=4, possibly thin). Differences: No small objects removed (e.g., isolated 3's in row17-18 should go if <3); pruning didn't smooth the 6's (e.g., row9 col13-16=6 kept, but jagged). This suggests the program under-prunes or has wrong thresholds for this denser grid; doesn't make sense as final clean output since shapes remain noisy compared to training expecteds' simplicity.

[2025-10-01 01:50:53] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, as seen in both trainings where bg=8 for train1 and bg=0 for train2.)

                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:

                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

                objects.append(component)

```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

    # ... (code as provided, but over-applies to wrong shapes)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to clean up noisy images by identifying the background color, extracting and removing small connected objects (noise), and pruning protrusions or thin extensions from larger objects to reveal clean, main shapes. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected clean versions of shapes like letters or symbols formed by colored pixels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (only up, down, left, right adjacency; no diagonals), same color only.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., min_size=3) by setting them to background.
 * Pruning removes individual cells that have fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), iteratively, to eliminate spikes or thin protrusions, but preserve thick/main body of objects.
 * Iterations in pruning are limited (e.g., max_iters=2-3) to avoid over-eroding large objects.
 * Subtleties: Pruning can disconnect or alter shapes if threshold/iterations are wrong; e.g., it might remove valid parts of irregular shapes like letters with thin arms. Small objects might be part of larger ones if not fully extracted. In examples, shapes like '1', '6', '2', '4', '8' need to be preserved in specific connected forms, but noise (isolated pixels or tiny clusters) must go. Expected outputs often fill in or connect implied shapes subtly (e.g., extending lines in '1' or closing gaps in '8'), suggesting possible need for minor filling or different connectivity. Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), colors are small integers (0-8). Process in stages: background ID -> remove small -> prune, but order matters (pruning after removal prevents re-growth of noise).
 * Easy to miss: Pruning should use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration; over-pruning can remove corners of objects; min_size=3 catches 1-2 pixel noise but might miss valid tiny features; background can be 0 (empty) or other values like 1/8.
 * All attempts so far apply these but fail on shape fidelity; no rotation/flipping, just in-place cleaning.

(Helpful: BFS-based connected component labeling for same-color 4-connectivity; essential for identifying objects to remove or analyze; works well but doesn't handle multi-color objects.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(Helpful: Uses extract_objects to remove tiny components; deepcopy prevents side effects; min_size=3 catches common noise but may need tuning for larger noise.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(Helpful in concept: Iteratively removes low-connectivity cells using temp grid; threshold=2 targets protrusions with <2 neighbors; but max_iters=2-3 is too low for complex shapes, leading to incomplete pruning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it applies background detection (works: correctly IDs 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), small object removal (partially works: removes some isolates but misses integrated noise), and protrusion pruning (doesn't work well: leaves jagged edges and doesn't fully clean shapes).
 * Train1: Generated keeps isolated 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) that expected removes or connects; 6's are pruned too aggressively (expected has full row of 6's in row7, but generated has gaps); 2's in rows15-17 are simplified but expected has more connected verticals (e.g., col16 row15/17 missing in generated); overall, shape of '1' (top) is fragmented vs. expected's smoother connections; unknown why row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated (possible over-pruning).
 * Train2: Generated leaves 8's as two separate verticals (rows5-6 cols5-6 and row7 col6), but expected connects them horizontally/vertically with fills (e.g., row4 col6=8 added, row5 col7=8); 4's are mostly kept but expected removes more internals (e.g., row16 col13=4 in generated but 0 in expected, creating hole); 2's are unchanged, matching expected (success there).
 * extract_objects is essential for removal step and works correctly for component sizing.
 * prune_protrusions is helpful but broken in practice: uses current new_g for neighbor checks but temp_g for writes (correct), but threshold=2 removes too many edge cells in irregular shapes; max_iters=3 still insufficient for propagating changes in train1's 1's and 6's; doesn't handle corners well (e.g., removes valid 1-pixel extensions).
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but doesn't catch small protrusions that are part of larger objects (pruning should handle, but fails).
 * Overall attempt shows partial understanding (cleans some noise) but mismatches on shape preservation; no filling of gaps, which expected sometimes implies.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have done minimal cleaning: background=1 correctly identified, but most 6's (rows6-11) and 4's (rows19-21) are left almost intact with only minor prunings (e.g., some 6's in row8 col3-6 removed? Wait, no—generated shows connected 6's but fragmented vs. likely expected clean shapes; row17-18 has 3's kept, but if they are small, should be removed). It looks like over-retention: e.g., the 6-cluster seems like a noisy 'O' or ring but expected probably a solid shape without innards; 4's at bottom look like a '4' with extensions, but generated leaves protrusions (e.g., row21 col7-8=4, possibly thin). Differences: No small objects removed (e.g., isolated 3's in row17-18 should go if <3); pruning didn't smooth the 6's (e.g., row9 col13-16=6 kept, but jagged). This suggests the program under-prunes or has wrong thresholds for this denser grid; doesn't make sense as final clean output since shapes remain noisy compared to training expecteds' simplicity.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:02:54] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean up noisy pixel art or segmented objects, where the goal is to identify and preserve main connected components of non-background colors while removing small noise artifacts and pruning thin or protruding elements that don't form solid shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all processing treats it as the "empty" space to fill in removed areas.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) to group adjacent cells, which helps capture irregular but intended shapes but can sometimes over-group noisy pixels.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., 3 cells) to eliminate isolated noise pixels or tiny specks, but this must be tuned to avoid removing parts of legitimate small objects.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove "protrusions" or thin arms by checking neighbor counts (e.g., using 4-connectivity for stricter boundary checks), but limited iterations prevent over-eroding main bodies; threshold (e.g., <2 neighbors) and max iterations (e.g., 3) are key to avoid destroying valid structures.
 * Shapes must be preserved exactly as in the expected output, including holes, branches, or specific topologies (e.g., the '1' and '6' in train 1 form digit-like structures with specific connections; '8' in train 2 has internal loops that shouldn't be filled or removed).
 * Subtle elements: Connectivity rules differ (8 for extraction vs. 4 for pruning) to balance grouping vs. smoothing; over-pruning can disconnect or shrink valid objects (e.g., turning a solid bar into fragments); color-specific processing isn't needed since objects are per-color, but multi-object grids require handling overlaps or adjacencies carefully.
 * All background areas must be uniformly set to the bg color post-processing; no new colors introduced.
 * Grids are rectangular (h x w), and edge cases like objects touching borders or single-cell objects need handling without assuming infinite padding.
 * Iterative changes in pruning must use temporary grids to avoid modifying during the same pass, preventing chain reactions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all steps.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This BFS-based extraction of 8-connected components per color is core and helpful for identifying removable objects; it captures positions and colors accurately.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, _ in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This applies the size threshold correctly to noise removal and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input; tuning min_size is key.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This iteratively smooths edges by removing low-neighbor cells using a temp grid; helpful for protrusions but needs parameter tuning to avoid over-pruning; uses 4-connectivity to be conservative.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown, using background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, max_iters=3) in sequence.
 * In train 1, small object removal worked partially (e.g., some isolated 1's and 2's gone), but failed to remove all noise—left a single 1 at [4][11], fragmented the main 1-shape (missing connections like [4][5-7], [5][11-12], [9][6]), kept noisy 6's intact but incomplete (e.g., [5][16-18] as 6,6,6 but expected more structure), and the 2's at bottom are reduced to two pairs but expected a more connected cross-like shape with [14][16], [15][16-17], [16][11,15]; pruning didn't fully connect or clean the 1's and 6's, possibly due to 8-connectivity over-grouping or insufficient iterations.
 * In train 1, the generated grid has extra empty rows (0-3,9-13) matching expected, but core shapes mismatch in topology (e.g., 1's look broken, not forming clean digits).
 * In train 2, small object removal incorrectly removed parts of the 8 (e.g., expected [4][6]=8, [5][6-8]=8,0,8 but generated all 0's except [5][5-6]=8,8; [6][6-8]=8,0,8 became 0,0,0 in some spots? Wait, generated shows [5][5-6]=8,8 but then prunes them away partially), and the 4's are heavily fragmented (e.g., expected solid [15][10-14]=4's with branches, but generated removes [15][12-13]=0,0 and [16][12]=4 but prunes others like [14][11]=0 instead of 4); pruning over-applied, turning valid thin parts into noise.
 * In train 2, the top 2's are preserved well (matching expected), showing small object removal works for clusters >3, but 8's internal structure (like loops) gets eroded.
 * extract_objects is essential and works for identifying components, but combined with pruning, it doesn't preserve expected shapes—possibly needs higher threshold or 8-connectivity in pruning too.
 * The main program chains functions correctly (bg -> remove_small -> prune), but parameters are too aggressive, leading to under-cleaning in some areas (train 1 noise remnants) and over-cleaning in others (train 2 shape loss).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant, but prune_protrusions is borderline overkill and may need replacement with a more targeted erosion (e.g., morphological operations) if it keeps failing on thin legit parts; deepcopy and temp_g usage is good but could be optimized.
 * Overall, the approach understands noise removal but misses subtlety in preserving exact object topologies, especially for digit-like or branched shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied the same logic but left excessive noise in the 6's (e.g., scattered 6's in rows 5-11 form irregular clusters like [5][5-7,13], [6][5-7,13], but expected likely a cleaner single shape or removal of protrusions to form a solid object; many single/isolated 6's should be gone per min_size=3, but they're retained and not pruned fully).
 * The 3's at [17][19-20], [18][19-20] are new/preserved but look like small pairs (<3? Wait, 4 cells total, but if connected, might stay; however, expected probably removes them as noise since they're tiny and bottom-placed, unlike main objects).
 * The 4's in rows 19-22 are partially preserved but fragmented (e.g., [19][4-8]=4's solid, [20][4-8]=4's, [21][5-8]=4's, [22][5-7]=4's, but [22][7-8]=1,1 instead of 4's? Generated shows [22][7]=1? No, [22] is [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]—wait, only up to [5-6]=4,4 then 1's, so pruning cut the bottom row short, missing expected full base).
 * Background is 1 (most common), correctly identified, and top rows are all 1's (good), but mid-section 6's are noisy/unpruned, and bottom 3's/4's are incomplete—suggests the program under-prunes scattered parts but over-prunes edges of larger objects; to handle test, need stricter small removal (maybe min_size=5) or better neighbor checks including diagonals in pruning to preserve branches.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for large blobs but fails on fine details, indicating the rules work for gross noise but not subtle shapes—e.g., 6's should form a clean loop or digit, but look jagged.

[2025-10-01 02:02:54] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

```
(Helpful for initial noise removal, but min_size=2 in the attempt was too low, removing valid small parts; suggest tuning to 3+ and applying selectively.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Iteratively remove non-background pixels with fewer than threshold same-color 4-neighbors until no changes.

    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean up noisy pixel art or segmented objects, where the goal is to identify and preserve main connected components of non-background colors while removing small noise artifacts and pruning thin or protruding elements that don't form solid shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all processing treats it as the "empty" space to fill in removed areas.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) to group adjacent cells, which helps capture irregular but intended shapes but can sometimes over-group noisy pixels.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., 3 cells) to eliminate isolated noise pixels or tiny specks, but this must be tuned to avoid removing parts of legitimate small objects.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove "protrusions" or thin arms by checking neighbor counts (e.g., using 4-connectivity for stricter boundary checks), but limited iterations prevent over-eroding main bodies; threshold (e.g., <2 neighbors) and max iterations (e.g., 3) are key to avoid destroying valid structures.
 * Shapes must be preserved exactly as in the expected output, including holes, branches, or specific topologies (e.g., the '1' and '6' in train 1 form digit-like structures with specific connections; '8' in train 2 has internal loops that shouldn't be filled or removed).
 * Subtle elements: Connectivity rules differ (8 for extraction vs. 4 for pruning) to balance grouping vs. smoothing; over-pruning can disconnect or shrink valid objects (e.g., turning a solid bar into fragments); color-specific processing isn't needed since objects are per-color, but multi-object grids require handling overlaps or adjacencies carefully.
 * All background areas must be uniformly set to the bg color post-processing; no new colors introduced.
 * Grids are rectangular (h x w), and edge cases like objects touching borders or single-cell objects need handling without assuming infinite padding.
 * Iterative changes in pruning must use temporary grids to avoid modifying during the same pass, preventing chain reactions.

(This applies the size threshold correctly to noise removal and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input; tuning min_size is key.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This iteratively smooths edges by removing low-neighbor cells using a temp grid; helpful for protrusions but needs parameter tuning to avoid over-pruning; uses 4-connectivity to be conservative.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown, using background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, max_iters=3) in sequence.
 * In train 1, small object removal worked partially (e.g., some isolated 1's and 2's gone), but failed to remove all noise—left a single 1 at [4][11], fragmented the main 1-shape (missing connections like [4][5-7], [5][11-12], [9][6]), kept noisy 6's intact but incomplete (e.g., [5][16-18] as 6,6,6 but expected more structure), and the 2's at bottom are reduced to two pairs but expected a more connected cross-like shape with [14][16], [15][16-17], [16][11,15]; pruning didn't fully connect or clean the 1's and 6's, possibly due to 8-connectivity over-grouping or insufficient iterations.
 * In train 1, the generated grid has extra empty rows (0-3,9-13) matching expected, but core shapes mismatch in topology (e.g., 1's look broken, not forming clean digits).
 * In train 2, small object removal incorrectly removed parts of the 8 (e.g., expected [4][6]=8, [5][6-8]=8,0,8 but generated all 0's except [5][5-6]=8,8; [6][6-8]=8,0,8 became 0,0,0 in some spots? Wait, generated shows [5][5-6]=8,8 but then prunes them away partially), and the 4's are heavily fragmented (e.g., expected solid [15][10-14]=4's with branches, but generated removes [15][12-13]=0,0 and [16][12]=4 but prunes others like [14][11]=0 instead of 4); pruning over-applied, turning valid thin parts into noise.
 * In train 2, the top 2's are preserved well (matching expected), showing small object removal works for clusters >3, but 8's internal structure (like loops) gets eroded.
 * extract_objects is essential and works for identifying components, but combined with pruning, it doesn't preserve expected shapes—possibly needs higher threshold or 8-connectivity in pruning too.
 * The main program chains functions correctly (bg -> remove_small -> prune), but parameters are too aggressive, leading to under-cleaning in some areas (train 1 noise remnants) and over-cleaning in others (train 2 shape loss).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant, but prune_protrusions is borderline overkill and may need replacement with a more targeted erosion (e.g., morphological operations) if it keeps failing on thin legit parts; deepcopy and temp_g usage is good but could be optimized.
 * Overall, the approach understands noise removal but misses subtlety in preserving exact object topologies, especially for digit-like or branched shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied the same logic but left excessive noise in the 6's (e.g., scattered 6's in rows 5-11 form irregular clusters like [5][5-7,13], [6][5-7,13], but expected likely a cleaner single shape or removal of protrusions to form a solid object; many single/isolated 6's should be gone per min_size=3, but they're retained and not pruned fully).
 * The 3's at [17][19-20], [18][19-20] are new/preserved but look like small pairs (<3? Wait, 4 cells total, but if connected, might stay; however, expected probably removes them as noise since they're tiny and bottom-placed, unlike main objects).
 * The 4's in rows 19-22 are partially preserved but fragmented (e.g., [19][4-8]=4's solid, [20][4-8]=4's, [21][5-8]=4's, [22][5-7]=4's, but [22][7-8]=1,1 instead of 4's? Generated shows [22][7]=1? No, [22] is [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]—wait, only up to [5-6]=4,4 then 1's, so pruning cut the bottom row short, missing expected full base).
 * Background is 1 (most common), correctly identified, and top rows are all 1's (good), but mid-section 6's are noisy/unpruned, and bottom 3's/4's are incomplete—suggests the program under-prunes scattered parts but over-prunes edges of larger objects; to handle test, need stricter small removal (maybe min_size=5) or better neighbor checks including diagonals in pruning to preserve branches.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for large blobs but fails on fine details, indicating the rules work for gross noise but not subtle shapes—e.g., 6's should form a clean loop or digit, but look jagged.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

    # ... (code as provided, but over-applies to wrong shapes)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to clean up noisy images by identifying the background color, extracting and removing small connected objects (noise), and pruning protrusions or thin extensions from larger objects to reveal clean, main shapes. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected clean versions of shapes like letters or symbols formed by colored pixels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (only up, down, left, right adjacency; no diagonals), same color only.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., min_size=3) by setting them to background.
 * Pruning removes individual cells that have fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), iteratively, to eliminate spikes or thin protrusions, but preserve thick/main body of objects.
 * Iterations in pruning are limited (e.g., max_iters=2-3) to avoid over-eroding large objects.
 * Subtleties: Pruning can disconnect or alter shapes if threshold/iterations are wrong; e.g., it might remove valid parts of irregular shapes like letters with thin arms. Small objects might be part of larger ones if not fully extracted. In examples, shapes like '1', '6', '2', '4', '8' need to be preserved in specific connected forms, but noise (isolated pixels or tiny clusters) must go. Expected outputs often fill in or connect implied shapes subtly (e.g., extending lines in '1' or closing gaps in '8'), suggesting possible need for minor filling or different connectivity. Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), colors are small integers (0-8). Process in stages: background ID -> remove small -> prune, but order matters (pruning after removal prevents re-growth of noise).
 * Easy to miss: Pruning should use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration; over-pruning can remove corners of objects; min_size=3 catches 1-2 pixel noise but might miss valid tiny features; background can be 0 (empty) or other values like 1/8.
 * All attempts so far apply these but fail on shape fidelity; no rotation/flipping, just in-place cleaning.

        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(Helpful in concept: Iteratively removes low-connectivity cells using temp grid; threshold=2 targets protrusions with <2 neighbors; but max_iters=2-3 is too low for complex shapes, leading to incomplete pruning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it applies background detection (works: correctly IDs 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), small object removal (partially works: removes some isolates but misses integrated noise), and protrusion pruning (doesn't work well: leaves jagged edges and doesn't fully clean shapes).
 * Train1: Generated keeps isolated 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) that expected removes or connects; 6's are pruned too aggressively (expected has full row of 6's in row7, but generated has gaps); 2's in rows15-17 are simplified but expected has more connected verticals (e.g., col16 row15/17 missing in generated); overall, shape of '1' (top) is fragmented vs. expected's smoother connections; unknown why row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated (possible over-pruning).
 * Train2: Generated leaves 8's as two separate verticals (rows5-6 cols5-6 and row7 col6), but expected connects them horizontally/vertically with fills (e.g., row4 col6=8 added, row5 col7=8); 4's are mostly kept but expected removes more internals (e.g., row16 col13=4 in generated but 0 in expected, creating hole); 2's are unchanged, matching expected (success there).
 * extract_objects is essential for removal step and works correctly for component sizing.
 * prune_protrusions is helpful but broken in practice: uses current new_g for neighbor checks but temp_g for writes (correct), but threshold=2 removes too many edge cells in irregular shapes; max_iters=3 still insufficient for propagating changes in train1's 1's and 6's; doesn't handle corners well (e.g., removes valid 1-pixel extensions).
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but doesn't catch small protrusions that are part of larger objects (pruning should handle, but fails).
 * Overall attempt shows partial understanding (cleans some noise) but mismatches on shape preservation; no filling of gaps, which expected sometimes implies.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have done minimal cleaning: background=1 correctly identified, but most 6's (rows6-11) and 4's (rows19-21) are left almost intact with only minor prunings (e.g., some 6's in row8 col3-6 removed? Wait, no—generated shows connected 6's but fragmented vs. likely expected clean shapes; row17-18 has 3's kept, but if they are small, should be removed). It looks like over-retention: e.g., the 6-cluster seems like a noisy 'O' or ring but expected probably a solid shape without innards; 4's at bottom look like a '4' with extensions, but generated leaves protrusions (e.g., row21 col7-8=4, possibly thin). Differences: No small objects removed (e.g., isolated 3's in row17-18 should go if <3); pruning didn't smooth the 6's (e.g., row9 col13-16=6 kept, but jagged). This suggests the program under-prunes or has wrong thresholds for this denser grid; doesn't make sense as final clean output since shapes remain noisy compared to training expecteds' simplicity.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:09:18] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to preprocess and clean up the grid by identifying a background color, extracting and removing small or noisy connected components (objects), and pruning thin protrusions or isolated parts to reveal or simplify the main intended shapes, likely for object recognition or shape completion in a stylized drawing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, but care must be taken as it may not be zero or a neutral value (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test).
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color; use 8-connectivity for extraction to capture diagonal connections, but 4-connectivity for pruning to avoid over-removal of diagonal structures.
 * Remove small objects below a size threshold (e.g., <4 cells) entirely, as they represent noise; however, this must not fragment larger intended shapes.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove cells with few same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3 in 4 directions) to eliminate protrusions, but limit iterations (e.g., max 2) to avoid eroding core shapes; threshold and iterations need tuning per example.
 * Shapes may need implicit connection or filling (e.g., in train1 expected, some 1's are connected across gaps, and 2's form a specific pattern not fully pruned in generated); subtle elements include handling near-connections or holes, and ensuring color-specific rules (e.g., 8's in train2 form a cross-like shape in expected but are over-removed in generated).
 * Grids are 22x22 based on outputs; assume rectangular and uniform width.
 * Do not alter background cells; preserve large, solid objects but clean their boundaries.
 * Potential for color-specific behaviors (e.g., 6's and 1's interact in train1, 8's and 4's in train2), but rules seem general; watch for overlapping or adjacent objects of different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Generated outputs often leave remnants of small/noisy parts (e.g., isolated 1's in train1) or fail to connect intended blobs (e.g., 1's in row4-9 of train1), and pruning may not handle diagonal protrusions well.
 * In test, background 1's dominate; objects like 6's (large shape), 3's (small pair), and 4's (medium shape) need cleaning, but expected likely removes 3's entirely and prunes 4's/6's to canonical forms without fragmenting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying connected components by color using BFS with 8-connectivity; useful for size-based removal.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 4) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This works for noise removal but may need adjustable min_size; helpful but not sufficient alone.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This is helpful for removing thin parts but uses 4-connectivity, which may miss diagonals; threshold=2 and max_iters=2 are a starting point but need tuning to avoid over-pruning solid shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt (the "last submission"), which combines background detection, small object removal (min_size=4), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, 4-connectivity, max_iters=2).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2). Extracts objects with 8-connectivity, allowing proper grouping of diagonally adjacent cells. Removes some small noise in train1 (e.g., isolated 1's reduced but not all). In train2, keeps large 2's and 4's intact while attempting to clean 8's.
 * What didn't work: In train1, failed to fully connect or clean the 1's shape (generated has fragmented 1's in rows 4-8, e.g., single 1 at [4][5], missing connections like expected [4][5-7]=1,1,1 and [5][4-5]=1,1; also left 6's partially pruned but not to expected solid triangle; bottom 2's are two separate pairs instead of expected cross-like [14][11]=2, [15][9-10,12-14,16]=2's in pattern). In train2, over-removed or misconnected 8's (generated has solid [5][5-6]=8,8 and [6][5-6]=8,8 but expected has scattered [4][6]=8, [5][6,8]=8,8, [6][6,8]=8,8, [7][7]=8 with gaps; 4's in rows 12-16 are fragmented, e.g., generated keeps extra 4's at [14][10]=4 and [16][12]=4 that expected removes or repositions). Pruning doesn't handle subtle shape completions (e.g., filling gaps in 1's or 8's). Small objects like potential 3's in test aren't removed if borderline size.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct for component analysis.
 * remove_small_objects is partially helpful but min_size=4 may be too low/high for some noises (e.g., didn't remove all small 1's in train1).
 * prune_protrusions is broken for shapes with diagonals (4-connectivity misses them, leading to incomplete cleaning in train1 6's and train2 8's); not aggressive enough for protrusions in 4's of train2.
 * Overall program chains steps well but parameters (min_size, threshold, iters, connectivity) need per-example or adaptive tuning; doesn't handle shape-specific rules like connecting across single gaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it preserves nearly all non-background elements (1 is bg), including the large 6's shape (rows 5-12, which seems like a complex blob but may need pruning to simplify), the small 3's pair (row17-18 cols19-21, size=5>4 so not removed, but expected likely removes as noise), and the 4's shape (rows18-21, kept mostly intact but with potential protrusions like [21][6-8]=4,4,1? wait, [21][5-7?]=4,4,1,1 but listed as 4,4,1,1,1; expected probably prunes to a cleaner form like a triangle or bar without extras).
 * Differences: No removal of small 3's (expected: set to 1's entirely). 6's are unpruned, leaving jagged edges (e.g., [5][5-6,12-13]=6's isolated from main; expected likely connects/simplifies to solid object). 4's have remnants (e.g., [18][4-7]=4's but [21][3]=4? wait, row19 [3-9]=4's solid, but generated keeps all without trimming singles like [21][6?]=1 but pattern suggests over-retention). It looks like minimal cleaning happened since objects are >4 cells, but puzzle requires more aggressive boundary smoothing or gap-filling, making the output too noisy compared to expected clean shapes.
 * To handle test: Increase pruning iterations/threshold or use 8-connectivity in pruning; add gap-filling logic for near-components; remove objects <6-8 size to catch 3's.

[2025-10-01 02:09:19] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, as seen in both trainings where bg=8 for train1 and bg=0 for train2.)

                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

        new_g = temp_g
    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean up noisy pixel art or segmented objects, where the goal is to identify and preserve main connected components of non-background colors while removing small noise artifacts and pruning thin or protruding elements that don't form solid shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all processing treats it as the "empty" space to fill in removed areas.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) to group adjacent cells, which helps capture irregular but intended shapes but can sometimes over-group noisy pixels.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., 3 cells) to eliminate isolated noise pixels or tiny specks, but this must be tuned to avoid removing parts of legitimate small objects.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove "protrusions" or thin arms by checking neighbor counts (e.g., using 4-connectivity for stricter boundary checks), but limited iterations prevent over-eroding main bodies; threshold (e.g., <2 neighbors) and max iterations (e.g., 3) are key to avoid destroying valid structures.
 * Shapes must be preserved exactly as in the expected output, including holes, branches, or specific topologies (e.g., the '1' and '6' in train 1 form digit-like structures with specific connections; '8' in train 2 has internal loops that shouldn't be filled or removed).
 * Subtle elements: Connectivity rules differ (8 for extraction vs. 4 for pruning) to balance grouping vs. smoothing; over-pruning can disconnect or shrink valid objects (e.g., turning a solid bar into fragments); color-specific processing isn't needed since objects are per-color, but multi-object grids require handling overlaps or adjacencies carefully.
 * All background areas must be uniformly set to the bg color post-processing; no new colors introduced.
 * Grids are rectangular (h x w), and edge cases like objects touching borders or single-cell objects need handling without assuming infinite padding.
 * Iterative changes in pruning must use temporary grids to avoid modifying during the same pass, preventing chain reactions.

(This BFS-based extraction of 8-connected components per color is core and helpful for identifying removable objects; it captures positions and colors accurately.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, _ in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This applies the size threshold correctly to noise removal and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input; tuning min_size is key.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This iteratively smooths edges by removing low-neighbor cells using a temp grid; helpful for protrusions but needs parameter tuning to avoid over-pruning; uses 4-connectivity to be conservative.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown, using background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, max_iters=3) in sequence.
 * In train 1, small object removal worked partially (e.g., some isolated 1's and 2's gone), but failed to remove all noise—left a single 1 at [4][11], fragmented the main 1-shape (missing connections like [4][5-7], [5][11-12], [9][6]), kept noisy 6's intact but incomplete (e.g., [5][16-18] as 6,6,6 but expected more structure), and the 2's at bottom are reduced to two pairs but expected a more connected cross-like shape with [14][16], [15][16-17], [16][11,15]; pruning didn't fully connect or clean the 1's and 6's, possibly due to 8-connectivity over-grouping or insufficient iterations.
 * In train 1, the generated grid has extra empty rows (0-3,9-13) matching expected, but core shapes mismatch in topology (e.g., 1's look broken, not forming clean digits).
 * In train 2, small object removal incorrectly removed parts of the 8 (e.g., expected [4][6]=8, [5][6-8]=8,0,8 but generated all 0's except [5][5-6]=8,8; [6][6-8]=8,0,8 became 0,0,0 in some spots? Wait, generated shows [5][5-6]=8,8 but then prunes them away partially), and the 4's are heavily fragmented (e.g., expected solid [15][10-14]=4's with branches, but generated removes [15][12-13]=0,0 and [16][12]=4 but prunes others like [14][11]=0 instead of 4); pruning over-applied, turning valid thin parts into noise.
 * In train 2, the top 2's are preserved well (matching expected), showing small object removal works for clusters >3, but 8's internal structure (like loops) gets eroded.
 * extract_objects is essential and works for identifying components, but combined with pruning, it doesn't preserve expected shapes—possibly needs higher threshold or 8-connectivity in pruning too.
 * The main program chains functions correctly (bg -> remove_small -> prune), but parameters are too aggressive, leading to under-cleaning in some areas (train 1 noise remnants) and over-cleaning in others (train 2 shape loss).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant, but prune_protrusions is borderline overkill and may need replacement with a more targeted erosion (e.g., morphological operations) if it keeps failing on thin legit parts; deepcopy and temp_g usage is good but could be optimized.
 * Overall, the approach understands noise removal but misses subtlety in preserving exact object topologies, especially for digit-like or branched shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied the same logic but left excessive noise in the 6's (e.g., scattered 6's in rows 5-11 form irregular clusters like [5][5-7,13], [6][5-7,13], but expected likely a cleaner single shape or removal of protrusions to form a solid object; many single/isolated 6's should be gone per min_size=3, but they're retained and not pruned fully).
 * The 3's at [17][19-20], [18][19-20] are new/preserved but look like small pairs (<3? Wait, 4 cells total, but if connected, might stay; however, expected probably removes them as noise since they're tiny and bottom-placed, unlike main objects).
 * The 4's in rows 19-22 are partially preserved but fragmented (e.g., [19][4-8]=4's solid, [20][4-8]=4's, [21][5-8]=4's, [22][5-7]=4's, but [22][7-8]=1,1 instead of 4's? Generated shows [22][7]=1? No, [22] is [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]—wait, only up to [5-6]=4,4 then 1's, so pruning cut the bottom row short, missing expected full base).
 * Background is 1 (most common), correctly identified, and top rows are all 1's (good), but mid-section 6's are noisy/unpruned, and bottom 3's/4's are incomplete—suggests the program under-prunes scattered parts but over-prunes edges of larger objects; to handle test, need stricter small removal (maybe min_size=5) or better neighbor checks including diagonals in pruning to preserve branches.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for large blobs but fails on fine details, indicating the rules work for gross noise but not subtle shapes—e.g., 6's should form a clean loop or digit, but look jagged.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to preprocess and clean up the grid by identifying a background color, extracting and removing small or noisy connected components (objects), and pruning thin protrusions or isolated parts to reveal or simplify the main intended shapes, likely for object recognition or shape completion in a stylized drawing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, but care must be taken as it may not be zero or a neutral value (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test).
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color; use 8-connectivity for extraction to capture diagonal connections, but 4-connectivity for pruning to avoid over-removal of diagonal structures.
 * Remove small objects below a size threshold (e.g., <4 cells) entirely, as they represent noise; however, this must not fragment larger intended shapes.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove cells with few same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3 in 4 directions) to eliminate protrusions, but limit iterations (e.g., max 2) to avoid eroding core shapes; threshold and iterations need tuning per example.
 * Shapes may need implicit connection or filling (e.g., in train1 expected, some 1's are connected across gaps, and 2's form a specific pattern not fully pruned in generated); subtle elements include handling near-connections or holes, and ensuring color-specific rules (e.g., 8's in train2 form a cross-like shape in expected but are over-removed in generated).
 * Grids are 22x22 based on outputs; assume rectangular and uniform width.
 * Do not alter background cells; preserve large, solid objects but clean their boundaries.
 * Potential for color-specific behaviors (e.g., 6's and 1's interact in train1, 8's and 4's in train2), but rules seem general; watch for overlapping or adjacent objects of different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Generated outputs often leave remnants of small/noisy parts (e.g., isolated 1's in train1) or fail to connect intended blobs (e.g., 1's in row4-9 of train1), and pruning may not handle diagonal protrusions well.
 * In test, background 1's dominate; objects like 6's (large shape), 3's (small pair), and 4's (medium shape) need cleaning, but expected likely removes 3's entirely and prunes 4's/6's to canonical forms without fragmenting.

```
(This is essential for identifying connected components by color using BFS with 8-connectivity; useful for size-based removal.)

            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This works for noise removal but may need adjustable min_size; helpful but not sufficient alone.)

                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:

                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This is helpful for removing thin parts but uses 4-connectivity, which may miss diagonals; threshold=2 and max_iters=2 are a starting point but need tuning to avoid over-pruning solid shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt (the "last submission"), which combines background detection, small object removal (min_size=4), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, 4-connectivity, max_iters=2).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2). Extracts objects with 8-connectivity, allowing proper grouping of diagonally adjacent cells. Removes some small noise in train1 (e.g., isolated 1's reduced but not all). In train2, keeps large 2's and 4's intact while attempting to clean 8's.
 * What didn't work: In train1, failed to fully connect or clean the 1's shape (generated has fragmented 1's in rows 4-8, e.g., single 1 at [4][5], missing connections like expected [4][5-7]=1,1,1 and [5][4-5]=1,1; also left 6's partially pruned but not to expected solid triangle; bottom 2's are two separate pairs instead of expected cross-like [14][11]=2, [15][9-10,12-14,16]=2's in pattern). In train2, over-removed or misconnected 8's (generated has solid [5][5-6]=8,8 and [6][5-6]=8,8 but expected has scattered [4][6]=8, [5][6,8]=8,8, [6][6,8]=8,8, [7][7]=8 with gaps; 4's in rows 12-16 are fragmented, e.g., generated keeps extra 4's at [14][10]=4 and [16][12]=4 that expected removes or repositions). Pruning doesn't handle subtle shape completions (e.g., filling gaps in 1's or 8's). Small objects like potential 3's in test aren't removed if borderline size.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct for component analysis.
 * remove_small_objects is partially helpful but min_size=4 may be too low/high for some noises (e.g., didn't remove all small 1's in train1).
 * prune_protrusions is broken for shapes with diagonals (4-connectivity misses them, leading to incomplete cleaning in train1 6's and train2 8's); not aggressive enough for protrusions in 4's of train2.
 * Overall program chains steps well but parameters (min_size, threshold, iters, connectivity) need per-example or adaptive tuning; doesn't handle shape-specific rules like connecting across single gaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it preserves nearly all non-background elements (1 is bg), including the large 6's shape (rows 5-12, which seems like a complex blob but may need pruning to simplify), the small 3's pair (row17-18 cols19-21, size=5>4 so not removed, but expected likely removes as noise), and the 4's shape (rows18-21, kept mostly intact but with potential protrusions like [21][6-8]=4,4,1? wait, [21][5-7?]=4,4,1,1 but listed as 4,4,1,1,1; expected probably prunes to a cleaner form like a triangle or bar without extras).
 * Differences: No removal of small 3's (expected: set to 1's entirely). 6's are unpruned, leaving jagged edges (e.g., [5][5-6,12-13]=6's isolated from main; expected likely connects/simplifies to solid object). 4's have remnants (e.g., [18][4-7]=4's but [21][3]=4? wait, row19 [3-9]=4's solid, but generated keeps all without trimming singles like [21][6?]=1 but pattern suggests over-retention). It looks like minimal cleaning happened since objects are >4 cells, but puzzle requires more aggressive boundary smoothing or gap-filling, making the output too noisy compared to expected clean shapes.
 * To handle test: Increase pruning iterations/threshold or use 8-connectivity in pruning; add gap-filling logic for near-components; remove objects <6-8 size to catch 3's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to clean up noisy images by identifying the background color, extracting and removing small connected objects (noise), and pruning protrusions or thin extensions from larger objects to reveal clean, main shapes. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected clean versions of shapes like letters or symbols formed by colored pixels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (only up, down, left, right adjacency; no diagonals), same color only.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., min_size=3) by setting them to background.
 * Pruning removes individual cells that have fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), iteratively, to eliminate spikes or thin protrusions, but preserve thick/main body of objects.
 * Iterations in pruning are limited (e.g., max_iters=2-3) to avoid over-eroding large objects.
 * Subtleties: Pruning can disconnect or alter shapes if threshold/iterations are wrong; e.g., it might remove valid parts of irregular shapes like letters with thin arms. Small objects might be part of larger ones if not fully extracted. In examples, shapes like '1', '6', '2', '4', '8' need to be preserved in specific connected forms, but noise (isolated pixels or tiny clusters) must go. Expected outputs often fill in or connect implied shapes subtly (e.g., extending lines in '1' or closing gaps in '8'), suggesting possible need for minor filling or different connectivity. Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), colors are small integers (0-8). Process in stages: background ID -> remove small -> prune, but order matters (pruning after removal prevents re-growth of noise).
 * Easy to miss: Pruning should use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration; over-pruning can remove corners of objects; min_size=3 catches 1-2 pixel noise but might miss valid tiny features; background can be 0 (empty) or other values like 1/8.
 * All attempts so far apply these but fail on shape fidelity; no rotation/flipping, just in-place cleaning.

(Helpful in concept: Iteratively removes low-connectivity cells using temp grid; threshold=2 targets protrusions with <2 neighbors; but max_iters=2-3 is too low for complex shapes, leading to incomplete pruning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it applies background detection (works: correctly IDs 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), small object removal (partially works: removes some isolates but misses integrated noise), and protrusion pruning (doesn't work well: leaves jagged edges and doesn't fully clean shapes).
 * Train1: Generated keeps isolated 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) that expected removes or connects; 6's are pruned too aggressively (expected has full row of 6's in row7, but generated has gaps); 2's in rows15-17 are simplified but expected has more connected verticals (e.g., col16 row15/17 missing in generated); overall, shape of '1' (top) is fragmented vs. expected's smoother connections; unknown why row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated (possible over-pruning).
 * Train2: Generated leaves 8's as two separate verticals (rows5-6 cols5-6 and row7 col6), but expected connects them horizontally/vertically with fills (e.g., row4 col6=8 added, row5 col7=8); 4's are mostly kept but expected removes more internals (e.g., row16 col13=4 in generated but 0 in expected, creating hole); 2's are unchanged, matching expected (success there).
 * extract_objects is essential for removal step and works correctly for component sizing.
 * prune_protrusions is helpful but broken in practice: uses current new_g for neighbor checks but temp_g for writes (correct), but threshold=2 removes too many edge cells in irregular shapes; max_iters=3 still insufficient for propagating changes in train1's 1's and 6's; doesn't handle corners well (e.g., removes valid 1-pixel extensions).
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but doesn't catch small protrusions that are part of larger objects (pruning should handle, but fails).
 * Overall attempt shows partial understanding (cleans some noise) but mismatches on shape preservation; no filling of gaps, which expected sometimes implies.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have done minimal cleaning: background=1 correctly identified, but most 6's (rows6-11) and 4's (rows19-21) are left almost intact with only minor prunings (e.g., some 6's in row8 col3-6 removed? Wait, no—generated shows connected 6's but fragmented vs. likely expected clean shapes; row17-18 has 3's kept, but if they are small, should be removed). It looks like over-retention: e.g., the 6-cluster seems like a noisy 'O' or ring but expected probably a solid shape without innards; 4's at bottom look like a '4' with extensions, but generated leaves protrusions (e.g., row21 col7-8=4, possibly thin). Differences: No small objects removed (e.g., isolated 3's in row17-18 should go if <3); pruning didn't smooth the 6's (e.g., row9 col13-16=6 kept, but jagged). This suggests the program under-prunes or has wrong thresholds for this denser grid; doesn't make sense as final clean output since shapes remain noisy compared to training expecteds' simplicity.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-01 02:15:12] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing a visual image, where the most common value is the background, and other values form connected "objects" or blobs that need cleaning: small objects (under a certain size) are removed, while larger ones have internal gaps filled based on neighborhood rules and protruding or low-connectivity parts pruned to reveal clean shapes. The goal is to output a modified grid with noise removed and shapes standardized, likely for pattern recognition or denoising in a puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training 1, 0 in training 2, 1 in test); all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Connected components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) for identifying blobs of the same value, but filling gaps uses 4-connectivity (orthogonal only) with a threshold of >=3 neighboring cells of the same color to avoid over-filling.
 * Small components (size <3) are entirely removed by setting to background, which handles noise but may miss subtle rules if components are defined differently (e.g., perhaps 4-connectivity for extraction in some cases).
 * For larger components, process within the bounding box: first fill background gaps inside if they have high orthogonal connectivity to the object; then iteratively prune (up to 2 iterations) cells of the object that have <2 neighbors (8-connectivity) to remove thin protrusions or isolated parts.
 * Subtlety: Pruning and filling are done per-component bounding box, which limits scope and prevents interference between objects, but may fail if objects are adjacent or if bounding boxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: The order matters—fill gaps before pruning to avoid removing cells that could connect; also, deep copies are used to avoid modifying during iteration, but multiple iterations of pruning stop early if no changes.
 * Components must be same-value only; different numbers (e.g., 1 and 6) are treated as separate objects, so no merging across colors.
 * Potential issue: The rules seem aimed at "skeletonizing" or "cleaning" shapes to match expected "ideal" forms, but thresholds (e.g., size<3, neighbors>=3 for fill, <2 for prune) may be too aggressive or not tuned, leading to over-pruning or under-filling.
 * Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), but heights/widths vary; assume consistent but verify bounds in all operations.

        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                c = g[i][j]
                comp = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    comp.append((x, y, c))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == c:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                components.append(comp)
    return components
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies background and extracts 8-connected components, which is essential for isolating objects like the 1's, 6's, 2's, etc., without merging different colors.
 * It successfully removes small components (<3 cells) by setting them to background, which works for obvious noise but may not handle cases where small parts are intended to stay if connected differently.
 * Gap-filling within bounding boxes using 4-connectivity (>=3 orthogonal neighbors) partially works but over-fills in training 1 (e.g., adds extra 1's in row 4 and connects unrelated areas) and under-fills in training 2 (e.g., fails to connect the 8's properly, leaving gaps).
 * Pruning with 8-connectivity (<2 neighbors, up to 2 iterations) removes some protrusions correctly (e.g., isolates some 6's in training 1) but over-prunes in training 1 (removes legs of the 1-shape and distorts 2's) and training 2 (leaves jagged 2's and 4's instead of smoothing).
 * In training 1, generated output keeps too many 1's in noisy positions (e.g., row 3 col 9 is 1 but expected 8; row 6 col 4-5 are 1's but expected connected differently) and fails to fill the 6's gap (row 6 col 18 is 6 but expected filled); 2's are pruned too much (row 15 col 11 is 2 but expected 8? Wait, no—expected has sparse 2's, but generated fills a blob).
 * In training 1, the 1-shape is over-connected and noisy (e.g., extra 1's in row 9 col 10-11), differing from expected clean outline; 6's have extra cells (row 7 col 17=6 but expected 8); 2's form a solid blob in generated but sparse in expected.
 * In training 2, generated adds extra 2's (e.g., row 2 col 15-18=2 but expected starts lower; row 5 col 14-17 over-filled) and fails to prune 8's correctly (row 5 col 5-8=8 but expected sparse); 4's are over-pruned (row 14 col 11-12=4 but expected more connected, row 16 col 12=4 but expected 0).
 * The program processes each component independently, which is good for multi-object grids, but bounding box limits may cause issues if objects are close (e.g., 1's and 6's in training 1 interfere indirectly).
 * Deep copies for temp grids are helpful to avoid iteration bugs, but the fixed 2 pruning iterations may be insufficient for complex shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the specific thresholds (size<3, fill>=3, prune<2) seem mismatched to the puzzle's expected clean shapes, suggesting they need tuning; extract_components is helpful and should be retained.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have incorrectly identified 1 as background (filling much of the grid with 1's) but retained distorted versions of 6's, 3's, and 4's, suggesting failed component extraction or over-aggressive filling/pruning.
 * For the 6's (upper middle), generated keeps a partial blob (e.g., rows 5-10 have 6's) but adds extras (row 6 col 5-7=6 but may overfill) and fails to clean connections to background, differing from what should be a clean shape (likely pruned to a simple form based on training patterns).
 * The 4's (bottom left) are partially retained but jagged (e.g., row 18 col 6=4 isolated, row 20 col 4-7=4 but expected smoother outline), and 3's (bottom right) are kept as a block but possibly over-pruned (row 17 col 17-20=3 but may need gap filling).
 * Overall, the test output fills too much with background 1's (e.g., entire top rows are 1's, erasing potential objects) and leaves uncleaned protrusions in 6's/4's, not matching the expected denoising to ideal shapes seen in training (where noise is removed and gaps filled precisely).
 * It does not make sense as a cleaned puzzle output, as it distorts shapes inconsistently (e.g., 6's look like a messy cluster instead of a pruned icon), indicating the program's thresholds fail on denser or larger components.

[2025-10-01 02:15:12] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:

                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean up noisy pixel art or segmented objects, where the goal is to identify and preserve main connected components of non-background colors while removing small noise artifacts and pruning thin or protruding elements that don't form solid shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all processing treats it as the "empty" space to fill in removed areas.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) to group adjacent cells, which helps capture irregular but intended shapes but can sometimes over-group noisy pixels.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., 3 cells) to eliminate isolated noise pixels or tiny specks, but this must be tuned to avoid removing parts of legitimate small objects.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove "protrusions" or thin arms by checking neighbor counts (e.g., using 4-connectivity for stricter boundary checks), but limited iterations prevent over-eroding main bodies; threshold (e.g., <2 neighbors) and max iterations (e.g., 3) are key to avoid destroying valid structures.
 * Shapes must be preserved exactly as in the expected output, including holes, branches, or specific topologies (e.g., the '1' and '6' in train 1 form digit-like structures with specific connections; '8' in train 2 has internal loops that shouldn't be filled or removed).
 * Subtle elements: Connectivity rules differ (8 for extraction vs. 4 for pruning) to balance grouping vs. smoothing; over-pruning can disconnect or shrink valid objects (e.g., turning a solid bar into fragments); color-specific processing isn't needed since objects are per-color, but multi-object grids require handling overlaps or adjacencies carefully.
 * All background areas must be uniformly set to the bg color post-processing; no new colors introduced.
 * Grids are rectangular (h x w), and edge cases like objects touching borders or single-cell objects need handling without assuming infinite padding.
 * Iterative changes in pruning must use temporary grids to avoid modifying during the same pass, preventing chain reactions.

(This BFS-based extraction of 8-connected components per color is core and helpful for identifying removable objects; it captures positions and colors accurately.)

            for i, j, _ in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This applies the size threshold correctly to noise removal and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input; tuning min_size is key.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)

        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):

                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1

        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This iteratively smooths edges by removing low-neighbor cells using a temp grid; helpful for protrusions but needs parameter tuning to avoid over-pruning; uses 4-connectivity to be conservative.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown, using background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, max_iters=3) in sequence.
 * In train 1, small object removal worked partially (e.g., some isolated 1's and 2's gone), but failed to remove all noise—left a single 1 at [4][11], fragmented the main 1-shape (missing connections like [4][5-7], [5][11-12], [9][6]), kept noisy 6's intact but incomplete (e.g., [5][16-18] as 6,6,6 but expected more structure), and the 2's at bottom are reduced to two pairs but expected a more connected cross-like shape with [14][16], [15][16-17], [16][11,15]; pruning didn't fully connect or clean the 1's and 6's, possibly due to 8-connectivity over-grouping or insufficient iterations.
 * In train 1, the generated grid has extra empty rows (0-3,9-13) matching expected, but core shapes mismatch in topology (e.g., 1's look broken, not forming clean digits).
 * In train 2, small object removal incorrectly removed parts of the 8 (e.g., expected [4][6]=8, [5][6-8]=8,0,8 but generated all 0's except [5][5-6]=8,8; [6][6-8]=8,0,8 became 0,0,0 in some spots? Wait, generated shows [5][5-6]=8,8 but then prunes them away partially), and the 4's are heavily fragmented (e.g., expected solid [15][10-14]=4's with branches, but generated removes [15][12-13]=0,0 and [16][12]=4 but prunes others like [14][11]=0 instead of 4); pruning over-applied, turning valid thin parts into noise.
 * In train 2, the top 2's are preserved well (matching expected), showing small object removal works for clusters >3, but 8's internal structure (like loops) gets eroded.
 * extract_objects is essential and works for identifying components, but combined with pruning, it doesn't preserve expected shapes—possibly needs higher threshold or 8-connectivity in pruning too.
 * The main program chains functions correctly (bg -> remove_small -> prune), but parameters are too aggressive, leading to under-cleaning in some areas (train 1 noise remnants) and over-cleaning in others (train 2 shape loss).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant, but prune_protrusions is borderline overkill and may need replacement with a more targeted erosion (e.g., morphological operations) if it keeps failing on thin legit parts; deepcopy and temp_g usage is good but could be optimized.
 * Overall, the approach understands noise removal but misses subtlety in preserving exact object topologies, especially for digit-like or branched shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied the same logic but left excessive noise in the 6's (e.g., scattered 6's in rows 5-11 form irregular clusters like [5][5-7,13], [6][5-7,13], but expected likely a cleaner single shape or removal of protrusions to form a solid object; many single/isolated 6's should be gone per min_size=3, but they're retained and not pruned fully).
 * The 3's at [17][19-20], [18][19-20] are new/preserved but look like small pairs (<3? Wait, 4 cells total, but if connected, might stay; however, expected probably removes them as noise since they're tiny and bottom-placed, unlike main objects).
 * The 4's in rows 19-22 are partially preserved but fragmented (e.g., [19][4-8]=4's solid, [20][4-8]=4's, [21][5-8]=4's, [22][5-7]=4's, but [22][7-8]=1,1 instead of 4's? Generated shows [22][7]=1? No, [22] is [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]—wait, only up to [5-6]=4,4 then 1's, so pruning cut the bottom row short, missing expected full base).
 * Background is 1 (most common), correctly identified, and top rows are all 1's (good), but mid-section 6's are noisy/unpruned, and bottom 3's/4's are incomplete—suggests the program under-prunes scattered parts but over-prunes edges of larger objects; to handle test, need stricter small removal (maybe min_size=5) or better neighbor checks including diagonals in pruning to preserve branches.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for large blobs but fails on fine details, indicating the rules work for gross noise but not subtle shapes—e.g., 6's should form a clean loop or digit, but look jagged.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to preprocess and clean up the grid by identifying a background color, extracting and removing small or noisy connected components (objects), and pruning thin protrusions or isolated parts to reveal or simplify the main intended shapes, likely for object recognition or shape completion in a stylized drawing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, but care must be taken as it may not be zero or a neutral value (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test).
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color; use 8-connectivity for extraction to capture diagonal connections, but 4-connectivity for pruning to avoid over-removal of diagonal structures.
 * Remove small objects below a size threshold (e.g., <4 cells) entirely, as they represent noise; however, this must not fragment larger intended shapes.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove cells with few same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3 in 4 directions) to eliminate protrusions, but limit iterations (e.g., max 2) to avoid eroding core shapes; threshold and iterations need tuning per example.
 * Shapes may need implicit connection or filling (e.g., in train1 expected, some 1's are connected across gaps, and 2's form a specific pattern not fully pruned in generated); subtle elements include handling near-connections or holes, and ensuring color-specific rules (e.g., 8's in train2 form a cross-like shape in expected but are over-removed in generated).
 * Grids are 22x22 based on outputs; assume rectangular and uniform width.
 * Do not alter background cells; preserve large, solid objects but clean their boundaries.
 * Potential for color-specific behaviors (e.g., 6's and 1's interact in train1, 8's and 4's in train2), but rules seem general; watch for overlapping or adjacent objects of different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Generated outputs often leave remnants of small/noisy parts (e.g., isolated 1's in train1) or fail to connect intended blobs (e.g., 1's in row4-9 of train1), and pruning may not handle diagonal protrusions well.
 * In test, background 1's dominate; objects like 6's (large shape), 3's (small pair), and 4's (medium shape) need cleaning, but expected likely removes 3's entirely and prunes 4's/6's to canonical forms without fragmenting.

    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:

    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying connected components by color using BFS with 8-connectivity; useful for size-based removal.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 4) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This works for noise removal but may need adjustable min_size; helpful but not sufficient alone.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])

        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This is helpful for removing thin parts but uses 4-connectivity, which may miss diagonals; threshold=2 and max_iters=2 are a starting point but need tuning to avoid over-pruning solid shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt (the "last submission"), which combines background detection, small object removal (min_size=4), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, 4-connectivity, max_iters=2).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2). Extracts objects with 8-connectivity, allowing proper grouping of diagonally adjacent cells. Removes some small noise in train1 (e.g., isolated 1's reduced but not all). In train2, keeps large 2's and 4's intact while attempting to clean 8's.
 * What didn't work: In train1, failed to fully connect or clean the 1's shape (generated has fragmented 1's in rows 4-8, e.g., single 1 at [4][5], missing connections like expected [4][5-7]=1,1,1 and [5][4-5]=1,1; also left 6's partially pruned but not to expected solid triangle; bottom 2's are two separate pairs instead of expected cross-like [14][11]=2, [15][9-10,12-14,16]=2's in pattern). In train2, over-removed or misconnected 8's (generated has solid [5][5-6]=8,8 and [6][5-6]=8,8 but expected has scattered [4][6]=8, [5][6,8]=8,8, [6][6,8]=8,8, [7][7]=8 with gaps; 4's in rows 12-16 are fragmented, e.g., generated keeps extra 4's at [14][10]=4 and [16][12]=4 that expected removes or repositions). Pruning doesn't handle subtle shape completions (e.g., filling gaps in 1's or 8's). Small objects like potential 3's in test aren't removed if borderline size.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct for component analysis.
 * remove_small_objects is partially helpful but min_size=4 may be too low/high for some noises (e.g., didn't remove all small 1's in train1).
 * prune_protrusions is broken for shapes with diagonals (4-connectivity misses them, leading to incomplete cleaning in train1 6's and train2 8's); not aggressive enough for protrusions in 4's of train2.
 * Overall program chains steps well but parameters (min_size, threshold, iters, connectivity) need per-example or adaptive tuning; doesn't handle shape-specific rules like connecting across single gaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it preserves nearly all non-background elements (1 is bg), including the large 6's shape (rows 5-12, which seems like a complex blob but may need pruning to simplify), the small 3's pair (row17-18 cols19-21, size=5>4 so not removed, but expected likely removes as noise), and the 4's shape (rows18-21, kept mostly intact but with potential protrusions like [21][6-8]=4,4,1? wait, [21][5-7?]=4,4,1,1 but listed as 4,4,1,1,1; expected probably prunes to a cleaner form like a triangle or bar without extras).
 * Differences: No removal of small 3's (expected: set to 1's entirely). 6's are unpruned, leaving jagged edges (e.g., [5][5-6,12-13]=6's isolated from main; expected likely connects/simplifies to solid object). 4's have remnants (e.g., [18][4-7]=4's but [21][3]=4? wait, row19 [3-9]=4's solid, but generated keeps all without trimming singles like [21][6?]=1 but pattern suggests over-retention). It looks like minimal cleaning happened since objects are >4 cells, but puzzle requires more aggressive boundary smoothing or gap-filling, making the output too noisy compared to expected clean shapes.
 * To handle test: Increase pruning iterations/threshold or use 8-connectivity in pruning; add gap-filling logic for near-components; remove objects <6-8 size to catch 3's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing a visual image, where the most common value is the background, and other values form connected "objects" or blobs that need cleaning: small objects (under a certain size) are removed, while larger ones have internal gaps filled based on neighborhood rules and protruding or low-connectivity parts pruned to reveal clean shapes. The goal is to output a modified grid with noise removed and shapes standardized, likely for pattern recognition or denoising in a puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training 1, 0 in training 2, 1 in test); all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Connected components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) for identifying blobs of the same value, but filling gaps uses 4-connectivity (orthogonal only) with a threshold of >=3 neighboring cells of the same color to avoid over-filling.
 * Small components (size <3) are entirely removed by setting to background, which handles noise but may miss subtle rules if components are defined differently (e.g., perhaps 4-connectivity for extraction in some cases).
 * For larger components, process within the bounding box: first fill background gaps inside if they have high orthogonal connectivity to the object; then iteratively prune (up to 2 iterations) cells of the object that have <2 neighbors (8-connectivity) to remove thin protrusions or isolated parts.
 * Subtlety: Pruning and filling are done per-component bounding box, which limits scope and prevents interference between objects, but may fail if objects are adjacent or if bounding boxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: The order matters—fill gaps before pruning to avoid removing cells that could connect; also, deep copies are used to avoid modifying during iteration, but multiple iterations of pruning stop early if no changes.
 * Components must be same-value only; different numbers (e.g., 1 and 6) are treated as separate objects, so no merging across colors.
 * Potential issue: The rules seem aimed at "skeletonizing" or "cleaning" shapes to match expected "ideal" forms, but thresholds (e.g., size<3, neighbors>=3 for fill, <2 for prune) may be too aggressive or not tuned, leading to over-pruning or under-filling.
 * Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), but heights/widths vary; assume consistent but verify bounds in all operations.

    return components
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies background and extracts 8-connected components, which is essential for isolating objects like the 1's, 6's, 2's, etc., without merging different colors.
 * It successfully removes small components (<3 cells) by setting them to background, which works for obvious noise but may not handle cases where small parts are intended to stay if connected differently.
 * Gap-filling within bounding boxes using 4-connectivity (>=3 orthogonal neighbors) partially works but over-fills in training 1 (e.g., adds extra 1's in row 4 and connects unrelated areas) and under-fills in training 2 (e.g., fails to connect the 8's properly, leaving gaps).
 * Pruning with 8-connectivity (<2 neighbors, up to 2 iterations) removes some protrusions correctly (e.g., isolates some 6's in training 1) but over-prunes in training 1 (removes legs of the 1-shape and distorts 2's) and training 2 (leaves jagged 2's and 4's instead of smoothing).
 * In training 1, generated output keeps too many 1's in noisy positions (e.g., row 3 col 9 is 1 but expected 8; row 6 col 4-5 are 1's but expected connected differently) and fails to fill the 6's gap (row 6 col 18 is 6 but expected filled); 2's are pruned too much (row 15 col 11 is 2 but expected 8? Wait, no—expected has sparse 2's, but generated fills a blob).
 * In training 1, the 1-shape is over-connected and noisy (e.g., extra 1's in row 9 col 10-11), differing from expected clean outline; 6's have extra cells (row 7 col 17=6 but expected 8); 2's form a solid blob in generated but sparse in expected.
 * In training 2, generated adds extra 2's (e.g., row 2 col 15-18=2 but expected starts lower; row 5 col 14-17 over-filled) and fails to prune 8's correctly (row 5 col 5-8=8 but expected sparse); 4's are over-pruned (row 14 col 11-12=4 but expected more connected, row 16 col 12=4 but expected 0).
 * The program processes each component independently, which is good for multi-object grids, but bounding box limits may cause issues if objects are close (e.g., 1's and 6's in training 1 interfere indirectly).
 * Deep copies for temp grids are helpful to avoid iteration bugs, but the fixed 2 pruning iterations may be insufficient for complex shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the specific thresholds (size<3, fill>=3, prune<2) seem mismatched to the puzzle's expected clean shapes, suggesting they need tuning; extract_components is helpful and should be retained.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have incorrectly identified 1 as background (filling much of the grid with 1's) but retained distorted versions of 6's, 3's, and 4's, suggesting failed component extraction or over-aggressive filling/pruning.
 * For the 6's (upper middle), generated keeps a partial blob (e.g., rows 5-10 have 6's) but adds extras (row 6 col 5-7=6 but may overfill) and fails to clean connections to background, differing from what should be a clean shape (likely pruned to a simple form based on training patterns).
 * The 4's (bottom left) are partially retained but jagged (e.g., row 18 col 6=4 isolated, row 20 col 4-7=4 but expected smoother outline), and 3's (bottom right) are kept as a block but possibly over-pruned (row 17 col 17-20=3 but may need gap filling).
 * Overall, the test output fills too much with background 1's (e.g., entire top rows are 1's, erasing potential objects) and leaves uncleaned protrusions in 6's/4's, not matching the expected denoising to ideal shapes seen in training (where noise is removed and gaps filled precisely).
 * It does not make sense as a cleaned puzzle output, as it distorts shapes inconsistently (e.g., 6's look like a messy cluster instead of a pruned icon), indicating the program's thresholds fail on denser or larger components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

    # ... (code as provided, but over-applies to wrong shapes)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to clean up noisy images by identifying the background color, extracting and removing small connected objects (noise), and pruning protrusions or thin extensions from larger objects to reveal clean, main shapes. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected clean versions of shapes like letters or symbols formed by colored pixels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (only up, down, left, right adjacency; no diagonals), same color only.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., min_size=3) by setting them to background.
 * Pruning removes individual cells that have fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), iteratively, to eliminate spikes or thin protrusions, but preserve thick/main body of objects.
 * Iterations in pruning are limited (e.g., max_iters=2-3) to avoid over-eroding large objects.
 * Subtleties: Pruning can disconnect or alter shapes if threshold/iterations are wrong; e.g., it might remove valid parts of irregular shapes like letters with thin arms. Small objects might be part of larger ones if not fully extracted. In examples, shapes like '1', '6', '2', '4', '8' need to be preserved in specific connected forms, but noise (isolated pixels or tiny clusters) must go. Expected outputs often fill in or connect implied shapes subtly (e.g., extending lines in '1' or closing gaps in '8'), suggesting possible need for minor filling or different connectivity. Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), colors are small integers (0-8). Process in stages: background ID -> remove small -> prune, but order matters (pruning after removal prevents re-growth of noise).
 * Easy to miss: Pruning should use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration; over-pruning can remove corners of objects; min_size=3 catches 1-2 pixel noise but might miss valid tiny features; background can be 0 (empty) or other values like 1/8.
 * All attempts so far apply these but fail on shape fidelity; no rotation/flipping, just in-place cleaning.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(Helpful: Correctly identifies most common color as background; used successfully in all examples.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(Helpful: BFS-based connected component labeling for same-color 4-connectivity; essential for identifying objects to remove or analyze; works well but doesn't handle multi-color objects.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(Helpful: Uses extract_objects to remove tiny components; deepcopy prevents side effects; min_size=3 catches common noise but may need tuning for larger noise.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(Helpful in concept: Iteratively removes low-connectivity cells using temp grid; threshold=2 targets protrusions with <2 neighbors; but max_iters=2-3 is too low for complex shapes, leading to incomplete pruning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it applies background detection (works: correctly IDs 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), small object removal (partially works: removes some isolates but misses integrated noise), and protrusion pruning (doesn't work well: leaves jagged edges and doesn't fully clean shapes).
 * Train1: Generated keeps isolated 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) that expected removes or connects; 6's are pruned too aggressively (expected has full row of 6's in row7, but generated has gaps); 2's in rows15-17 are simplified but expected has more connected verticals (e.g., col16 row15/17 missing in generated); overall, shape of '1' (top) is fragmented vs. expected's smoother connections; unknown why row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated (possible over-pruning).
 * Train2: Generated leaves 8's as two separate verticals (rows5-6 cols5-6 and row7 col6), but expected connects them horizontally/vertically with fills (e.g., row4 col6=8 added, row5 col7=8); 4's are mostly kept but expected removes more internals (e.g., row16 col13=4 in generated but 0 in expected, creating hole); 2's are unchanged, matching expected (success there).
 * extract_objects is essential for removal step and works correctly for component sizing.
 * prune_protrusions is helpful but broken in practice: uses current new_g for neighbor checks but temp_g for writes (correct), but threshold=2 removes too many edge cells in irregular shapes; max_iters=3 still insufficient for propagating changes in train1's 1's and 6's; doesn't handle corners well (e.g., removes valid 1-pixel extensions).
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but doesn't catch small protrusions that are part of larger objects (pruning should handle, but fails).
 * Overall attempt shows partial understanding (cleans some noise) but mismatches on shape preservation; no filling of gaps, which expected sometimes implies.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have done minimal cleaning: background=1 correctly identified, but most 6's (rows6-11) and 4's (rows19-21) are left almost intact with only minor prunings (e.g., some 6's in row8 col3-6 removed? Wait, no—generated shows connected 6's but fragmented vs. likely expected clean shapes; row17-18 has 3's kept, but if they are small, should be removed). It looks like over-retention: e.g., the 6-cluster seems like a noisy 'O' or ring but expected probably a solid shape without innards; 4's at bottom look like a '4' with extensions, but generated leaves protrusions (e.g., row21 col7-8=4, possibly thin). Differences: No small objects removed (e.g., isolated 3's in row17-18 should go if <3); pruning didn't smooth the 6's (e.g., row9 col13-16=6 kept, but jagged). This suggests the program under-prunes or has wrong thresholds for this denser grid; doesn't make sense as final clean output since shapes remain noisy compared to training expecteds' simplicity.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:22:27] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image cleanup, where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected objects (likely 8-connected components), remove small noise objects below a certain size threshold, and prune thin protrusions or isolated pixels from larger objects to simplify and reveal clean main shapes, while preserving the overall structure of significant blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals) to group pixels.
 * Small objects (e.g., isolated pixels or tiny clusters) should be removed entirely if below a size threshold (e.g., 3-4 pixels), as they represent noise.
 * Larger objects may have protrusions (e.g., single pixels or thin arms with few neighboring same-color pixels); these should be iteratively pruned if a pixel has fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), but only up to a limited number of iterations to avoid over-pruning core shapes.
 * Subtleties include: not removing parts of large connected objects prematurely (e.g., don't disconnect main blobs); handling cases where noise touches main objects without merging them; ensuring pruning doesn't fill in intentional holes or thin features in expected clean shapes; 8-connectivity is crucial as 4-connectivity might split objects incorrectly; min_size and threshold need tuning per example (e.g., 4 worked partially but not fully); iterations in pruning prevent excessive erosion but can miss multi-step protrusions.
 * Grids are rectangular (consistent width, e.g., 22 columns here), and outputs must match exactly in pixel values and positions.
 * Colors are integers (e.g., 0/1/8 as bg, 1/2/4/6 as objects); same-color components are treated separately.
 * Easy to miss: protrusions might be diagonal or require multiple pruning passes; small objects adjacent to large ones aren't absorbed; expected outputs often fill noise back to bg but retain imperfect shapes if they match the "clean" intent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected component extraction, returns list of pixel lists per object with positions and color; helpful for identifying small vs. large blobs.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This works well for eliminating tiny noise clusters but needs tunable min_size, e.g., 4 in this attempt; doesn't affect large objects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and uses 8-connectivity for extraction, which is a good foundation.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=4 removed some noise (e.g., isolated 1 in ex1 row 3) but failed to remove others, like small 1 protrusions in ex1 rows 4-5 and 9.
 * prune_protrusions with threshold=2 and max_iters=3 partially smoothed shapes (e.g., removed some thin parts in ex1 6's and ex2 2's) but over-pruned or under-pruned: in ex1, left extra 1's in row 4 (generated: 1,1,8 vs. expected: 1,1,1,1? wait, actually mismatched filling); in ex2, failed to remove a single 2 in row 2 col15 and extra 4 in row 16 col13.
 * In ex1, generated retained noisy 1's around the main 1 shape (e.g., row 4 has only two 1's instead of four connected; row 8 has extra 1 in col7), differing from expected by not connecting/filling the main blob properly and leaving protrusions; 6's in rows 5-8 have gaps filled incorrectly (generated row5: 6,6,6,6 vs. expected similar but contextually clean); bottom 2's in rows 14-16 have extra disconnected 2's (e.g., row14 col11 single 2 retained vs. expected removed).
 * In ex2, generated left a small 2 cluster in rows 2-3 (single 2 in row2 col15, trio in row3) which should be part of or removed from main 2 shape (expected starts clean in row2 all 0's, row3 has four 2's); 8's shape is mostly cleaned but generated row5 has extra 8's positions; bottom 4's in row16 retained a single 4 (col13) vs. expected 0 there, and row15 has mismatched 4 positions.
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection; deepcopy is necessary to avoid mutating input.
 * prune_protrusions is somewhat helpful for erosion but broken in implementation: it checks neighbors in original new_g but updates temp_g, which can cause inconsistent counting across iterations; threshold=2 removes pixels with <2 neighbors (i.e., 0-1), but may need >2 for stricter pruning; max_iters=3 is too low for deeper protrusions, leading to incomplete cleanup.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but mismatches in exact pixel positions (e.g., unknown why ex1 row4 doesn't connect 1's fully; ex2 row16 extra 4 persists), suggesting over-reliance on fixed params without shape-specific logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=1, objects in 6/3/4) partially cleans the grid by removing some small noise but retains or incorrectly modifies main shapes, so it does not look fully correct.
 * Upper 6's shape (rows 5-11) has protrusions pruned (e.g., row6 col8-12 simplified to 1's) but leaves thin arms (e.g., row7 col6 single 6? wait, generated row7: 6,6,1's) that might need further removal; compared to mental run of rules (remove <4 size, prune <2 neighbors), it seems to have over-pruned some connections (e.g., row8 col3-6: 6,6,6,6 but expected might retain more for blob integrity).
 * Middle 6's in rows 12-14 look smoothed but row13 has extra 6's in col7-12 that could be protrusion remnants; lower 3's (rows 17-19) retain small cluster (e.g., row17 col17-20: 3,3,3,3 but possibly too small to keep if <4).
 * Bottom 4's (rows 19-22) have the main shape but extra 4 in row18 col6 and thin line in row22 col6-9; overall, output fills much to bg=1 correctly but differences like retained small 3's and unpruned 4 arms suggest incomplete pruning (e.g., why row22 col6-9 not removed if low neighbors? unknown, but it mismatches a clean expectation of solid 4 blob without tails).
 * Test makes partial sense (noise reduced) but not correct, as subtle connections (e.g., diagonal 6's) aren't fully handled, leading to fragmented shapes; to fix, increase min_size to 5 for 3's, raise threshold to 3, or add post-processing for hole filling.

[2025-10-01 02:22:27] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

    return new_g
```
(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean up noisy pixel art or segmented objects, where the goal is to identify and preserve main connected components of non-background colors while removing small noise artifacts and pruning thin or protruding elements that don't form solid shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all processing treats it as the "empty" space to fill in removed areas.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) to group adjacent cells, which helps capture irregular but intended shapes but can sometimes over-group noisy pixels.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., 3 cells) to eliminate isolated noise pixels or tiny specks, but this must be tuned to avoid removing parts of legitimate small objects.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove "protrusions" or thin arms by checking neighbor counts (e.g., using 4-connectivity for stricter boundary checks), but limited iterations prevent over-eroding main bodies; threshold (e.g., <2 neighbors) and max iterations (e.g., 3) are key to avoid destroying valid structures.
 * Shapes must be preserved exactly as in the expected output, including holes, branches, or specific topologies (e.g., the '1' and '6' in train 1 form digit-like structures with specific connections; '8' in train 2 has internal loops that shouldn't be filled or removed).
 * Subtle elements: Connectivity rules differ (8 for extraction vs. 4 for pruning) to balance grouping vs. smoothing; over-pruning can disconnect or shrink valid objects (e.g., turning a solid bar into fragments); color-specific processing isn't needed since objects are per-color, but multi-object grids require handling overlaps or adjacencies carefully.
 * All background areas must be uniformly set to the bg color post-processing; no new colors introduced.
 * Grids are rectangular (h x w), and edge cases like objects touching borders or single-cell objects need handling without assuming infinite padding.
 * Iterative changes in pruning must use temporary grids to avoid modifying during the same pass, preventing chain reactions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque, defaultdict
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all steps.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This BFS-based extraction of 8-connected components per color is core and helpful for identifying removable objects; it captures positions and colors accurately.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, _ in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This applies the size threshold correctly to noise removal and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input; tuning min_size is key.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This iteratively smooths edges by removing low-neighbor cells using a temp grid; helpful for protrusions but needs parameter tuning to avoid over-pruning; uses 4-connectivity to be conservative.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown, using background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, max_iters=3) in sequence.
 * In train 1, small object removal worked partially (e.g., some isolated 1's and 2's gone), but failed to remove all noise—left a single 1 at [4][11], fragmented the main 1-shape (missing connections like [4][5-7], [5][11-12], [9][6]), kept noisy 6's intact but incomplete (e.g., [5][16-18] as 6,6,6 but expected more structure), and the 2's at bottom are reduced to two pairs but expected a more connected cross-like shape with [14][16], [15][16-17], [16][11,15]; pruning didn't fully connect or clean the 1's and 6's, possibly due to 8-connectivity over-grouping or insufficient iterations.
 * In train 1, the generated grid has extra empty rows (0-3,9-13) matching expected, but core shapes mismatch in topology (e.g., 1's look broken, not forming clean digits).
 * In train 2, small object removal incorrectly removed parts of the 8 (e.g., expected [4][6]=8, [5][6-8]=8,0,8 but generated all 0's except [5][5-6]=8,8; [6][6-8]=8,0,8 became 0,0,0 in some spots? Wait, generated shows [5][5-6]=8,8 but then prunes them away partially), and the 4's are heavily fragmented (e.g., expected solid [15][10-14]=4's with branches, but generated removes [15][12-13]=0,0 and [16][12]=4 but prunes others like [14][11]=0 instead of 4); pruning over-applied, turning valid thin parts into noise.
 * In train 2, the top 2's are preserved well (matching expected), showing small object removal works for clusters >3, but 8's internal structure (like loops) gets eroded.
 * extract_objects is essential and works for identifying components, but combined with pruning, it doesn't preserve expected shapes—possibly needs higher threshold or 8-connectivity in pruning too.
 * The main program chains functions correctly (bg -> remove_small -> prune), but parameters are too aggressive, leading to under-cleaning in some areas (train 1 noise remnants) and over-cleaning in others (train 2 shape loss).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant, but prune_protrusions is borderline overkill and may need replacement with a more targeted erosion (e.g., morphological operations) if it keeps failing on thin legit parts; deepcopy and temp_g usage is good but could be optimized.
 * Overall, the approach understands noise removal but misses subtlety in preserving exact object topologies, especially for digit-like or branched shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied the same logic but left excessive noise in the 6's (e.g., scattered 6's in rows 5-11 form irregular clusters like [5][5-7,13], [6][5-7,13], but expected likely a cleaner single shape or removal of protrusions to form a solid object; many single/isolated 6's should be gone per min_size=3, but they're retained and not pruned fully).
 * The 3's at [17][19-20], [18][19-20] are new/preserved but look like small pairs (<3? Wait, 4 cells total, but if connected, might stay; however, expected probably removes them as noise since they're tiny and bottom-placed, unlike main objects).
 * The 4's in rows 19-22 are partially preserved but fragmented (e.g., [19][4-8]=4's solid, [20][4-8]=4's, [21][5-8]=4's, [22][5-7]=4's, but [22][7-8]=1,1 instead of 4's? Generated shows [22][7]=1? No, [22] is [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]—wait, only up to [5-6]=4,4 then 1's, so pruning cut the bottom row short, missing expected full base).
 * Background is 1 (most common), correctly identified, and top rows are all 1's (good), but mid-section 6's are noisy/unpruned, and bottom 3's/4's are incomplete—suggests the program under-prunes scattered parts but over-prunes edges of larger objects; to handle test, need stricter small removal (maybe min_size=5) or better neighbor checks including diagonals in pruning to preserve branches.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for large blobs but fails on fine details, indicating the rules work for gross noise but not subtle shapes—e.g., 6's should form a clean loop or digit, but look jagged.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to preprocess and clean up the grid by identifying a background color, extracting and removing small or noisy connected components (objects), and pruning thin protrusions or isolated parts to reveal or simplify the main intended shapes, likely for object recognition or shape completion in a stylized drawing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, but care must be taken as it may not be zero or a neutral value (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test).
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color; use 8-connectivity for extraction to capture diagonal connections, but 4-connectivity for pruning to avoid over-removal of diagonal structures.
 * Remove small objects below a size threshold (e.g., <4 cells) entirely, as they represent noise; however, this must not fragment larger intended shapes.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove cells with few same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3 in 4 directions) to eliminate protrusions, but limit iterations (e.g., max 2) to avoid eroding core shapes; threshold and iterations need tuning per example.
 * Shapes may need implicit connection or filling (e.g., in train1 expected, some 1's are connected across gaps, and 2's form a specific pattern not fully pruned in generated); subtle elements include handling near-connections or holes, and ensuring color-specific rules (e.g., 8's in train2 form a cross-like shape in expected but are over-removed in generated).
 * Grids are 22x22 based on outputs; assume rectangular and uniform width.
 * Do not alter background cells; preserve large, solid objects but clean their boundaries.
 * Potential for color-specific behaviors (e.g., 6's and 1's interact in train1, 8's and 4's in train2), but rules seem general; watch for overlapping or adjacent objects of different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Generated outputs often leave remnants of small/noisy parts (e.g., isolated 1's in train1) or fail to connect intended blobs (e.g., 1's in row4-9 of train1), and pruning may not handle diagonal protrusions well.
 * In test, background 1's dominate; objects like 6's (large shape), 3's (small pair), and 4's (medium shape) need cleaning, but expected likely removes 3's entirely and prunes 4's/6's to canonical forms without fragmenting.

    return new_g
```
(This is helpful for removing thin parts but uses 4-connectivity, which may miss diagonals; threshold=2 and max_iters=2 are a starting point but need tuning to avoid over-pruning solid shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt (the "last submission"), which combines background detection, small object removal (min_size=4), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, 4-connectivity, max_iters=2).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2). Extracts objects with 8-connectivity, allowing proper grouping of diagonally adjacent cells. Removes some small noise in train1 (e.g., isolated 1's reduced but not all). In train2, keeps large 2's and 4's intact while attempting to clean 8's.
 * What didn't work: In train1, failed to fully connect or clean the 1's shape (generated has fragmented 1's in rows 4-8, e.g., single 1 at [4][5], missing connections like expected [4][5-7]=1,1,1 and [5][4-5]=1,1; also left 6's partially pruned but not to expected solid triangle; bottom 2's are two separate pairs instead of expected cross-like [14][11]=2, [15][9-10,12-14,16]=2's in pattern). In train2, over-removed or misconnected 8's (generated has solid [5][5-6]=8,8 and [6][5-6]=8,8 but expected has scattered [4][6]=8, [5][6,8]=8,8, [6][6,8]=8,8, [7][7]=8 with gaps; 4's in rows 12-16 are fragmented, e.g., generated keeps extra 4's at [14][10]=4 and [16][12]=4 that expected removes or repositions). Pruning doesn't handle subtle shape completions (e.g., filling gaps in 1's or 8's). Small objects like potential 3's in test aren't removed if borderline size.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct for component analysis.
 * remove_small_objects is partially helpful but min_size=4 may be too low/high for some noises (e.g., didn't remove all small 1's in train1).
 * prune_protrusions is broken for shapes with diagonals (4-connectivity misses them, leading to incomplete cleaning in train1 6's and train2 8's); not aggressive enough for protrusions in 4's of train2.
 * Overall program chains steps well but parameters (min_size, threshold, iters, connectivity) need per-example or adaptive tuning; doesn't handle shape-specific rules like connecting across single gaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it preserves nearly all non-background elements (1 is bg), including the large 6's shape (rows 5-12, which seems like a complex blob but may need pruning to simplify), the small 3's pair (row17-18 cols19-21, size=5>4 so not removed, but expected likely removes as noise), and the 4's shape (rows18-21, kept mostly intact but with potential protrusions like [21][6-8]=4,4,1? wait, [21][5-7?]=4,4,1,1 but listed as 4,4,1,1,1; expected probably prunes to a cleaner form like a triangle or bar without extras).
 * Differences: No removal of small 3's (expected: set to 1's entirely). 6's are unpruned, leaving jagged edges (e.g., [5][5-6,12-13]=6's isolated from main; expected likely connects/simplifies to solid object). 4's have remnants (e.g., [18][4-7]=4's but [21][3]=4? wait, row19 [3-9]=4's solid, but generated keeps all without trimming singles like [21][6?]=1 but pattern suggests over-retention). It looks like minimal cleaning happened since objects are >4 cells, but puzzle requires more aggressive boundary smoothing or gap-filling, making the output too noisy compared to expected clean shapes.
 * To handle test: Increase pruning iterations/threshold or use 8-connectivity in pruning; add gap-filling logic for near-components; remove objects <6-8 size to catch 3's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing a visual image, where the most common value is the background, and other values form connected "objects" or blobs that need cleaning: small objects (under a certain size) are removed, while larger ones have internal gaps filled based on neighborhood rules and protruding or low-connectivity parts pruned to reveal clean shapes. The goal is to output a modified grid with noise removed and shapes standardized, likely for pattern recognition or denoising in a puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training 1, 0 in training 2, 1 in test); all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Connected components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) for identifying blobs of the same value, but filling gaps uses 4-connectivity (orthogonal only) with a threshold of >=3 neighboring cells of the same color to avoid over-filling.
 * Small components (size <3) are entirely removed by setting to background, which handles noise but may miss subtle rules if components are defined differently (e.g., perhaps 4-connectivity for extraction in some cases).
 * For larger components, process within the bounding box: first fill background gaps inside if they have high orthogonal connectivity to the object; then iteratively prune (up to 2 iterations) cells of the object that have <2 neighbors (8-connectivity) to remove thin protrusions or isolated parts.
 * Subtlety: Pruning and filling are done per-component bounding box, which limits scope and prevents interference between objects, but may fail if objects are adjacent or if bounding boxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: The order matters—fill gaps before pruning to avoid removing cells that could connect; also, deep copies are used to avoid modifying during iteration, but multiple iterations of pruning stop early if no changes.
 * Components must be same-value only; different numbers (e.g., 1 and 6) are treated as separate objects, so no merging across colors.
 * Potential issue: The rules seem aimed at "skeletonizing" or "cleaning" shapes to match expected "ideal" forms, but thresholds (e.g., size<3, neighbors>=3 for fill, <2 for prune) may be too aggressive or not tuned, leading to over-pruning or under-filling.
 * Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), but heights/widths vary; assume consistent but verify bounds in all operations.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies background and extracts 8-connected components, which is essential for isolating objects like the 1's, 6's, 2's, etc., without merging different colors.
 * It successfully removes small components (<3 cells) by setting them to background, which works for obvious noise but may not handle cases where small parts are intended to stay if connected differently.
 * Gap-filling within bounding boxes using 4-connectivity (>=3 orthogonal neighbors) partially works but over-fills in training 1 (e.g., adds extra 1's in row 4 and connects unrelated areas) and under-fills in training 2 (e.g., fails to connect the 8's properly, leaving gaps).
 * Pruning with 8-connectivity (<2 neighbors, up to 2 iterations) removes some protrusions correctly (e.g., isolates some 6's in training 1) but over-prunes in training 1 (removes legs of the 1-shape and distorts 2's) and training 2 (leaves jagged 2's and 4's instead of smoothing).
 * In training 1, generated output keeps too many 1's in noisy positions (e.g., row 3 col 9 is 1 but expected 8; row 6 col 4-5 are 1's but expected connected differently) and fails to fill the 6's gap (row 6 col 18 is 6 but expected filled); 2's are pruned too much (row 15 col 11 is 2 but expected 8? Wait, no—expected has sparse 2's, but generated fills a blob).
 * In training 1, the 1-shape is over-connected and noisy (e.g., extra 1's in row 9 col 10-11), differing from expected clean outline; 6's have extra cells (row 7 col 17=6 but expected 8); 2's form a solid blob in generated but sparse in expected.
 * In training 2, generated adds extra 2's (e.g., row 2 col 15-18=2 but expected starts lower; row 5 col 14-17 over-filled) and fails to prune 8's correctly (row 5 col 5-8=8 but expected sparse); 4's are over-pruned (row 14 col 11-12=4 but expected more connected, row 16 col 12=4 but expected 0).
 * The program processes each component independently, which is good for multi-object grids, but bounding box limits may cause issues if objects are close (e.g., 1's and 6's in training 1 interfere indirectly).
 * Deep copies for temp grids are helpful to avoid iteration bugs, but the fixed 2 pruning iterations may be insufficient for complex shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the specific thresholds (size<3, fill>=3, prune<2) seem mismatched to the puzzle's expected clean shapes, suggesting they need tuning; extract_components is helpful and should be retained.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have incorrectly identified 1 as background (filling much of the grid with 1's) but retained distorted versions of 6's, 3's, and 4's, suggesting failed component extraction or over-aggressive filling/pruning.
 * For the 6's (upper middle), generated keeps a partial blob (e.g., rows 5-10 have 6's) but adds extras (row 6 col 5-7=6 but may overfill) and fails to clean connections to background, differing from what should be a clean shape (likely pruned to a simple form based on training patterns).
 * The 4's (bottom left) are partially retained but jagged (e.g., row 18 col 6=4 isolated, row 20 col 4-7=4 but expected smoother outline), and 3's (bottom right) are kept as a block but possibly over-pruned (row 17 col 17-20=3 but may need gap filling).
 * Overall, the test output fills too much with background 1's (e.g., entire top rows are 1's, erasing potential objects) and leaves uncleaned protrusions in 6's/4's, not matching the expected denoising to ideal shapes seen in training (where noise is removed and gaps filled precisely).
 * It does not make sense as a cleaned puzzle output, as it distorts shapes inconsistently (e.g., 6's look like a messy cluster instead of a pruned icon), indicating the program's thresholds fail on denser or larger components.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

    # ... (code as provided, but over-applies to wrong shapes)
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to clean up noisy images by identifying the background color, extracting and removing small connected objects (noise), and pruning protrusions or thin extensions from larger objects to reveal clean, main shapes. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected clean versions of shapes like letters or symbols formed by colored pixels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (only up, down, left, right adjacency; no diagonals), same color only.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., min_size=3) by setting them to background.
 * Pruning removes individual cells that have fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), iteratively, to eliminate spikes or thin protrusions, but preserve thick/main body of objects.
 * Iterations in pruning are limited (e.g., max_iters=2-3) to avoid over-eroding large objects.
 * Subtleties: Pruning can disconnect or alter shapes if threshold/iterations are wrong; e.g., it might remove valid parts of irregular shapes like letters with thin arms. Small objects might be part of larger ones if not fully extracted. In examples, shapes like '1', '6', '2', '4', '8' need to be preserved in specific connected forms, but noise (isolated pixels or tiny clusters) must go. Expected outputs often fill in or connect implied shapes subtly (e.g., extending lines in '1' or closing gaps in '8'), suggesting possible need for minor filling or different connectivity. Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), colors are small integers (0-8). Process in stages: background ID -> remove small -> prune, but order matters (pruning after removal prevents re-growth of noise).
 * Easy to miss: Pruning should use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration; over-pruning can remove corners of objects; min_size=3 catches 1-2 pixel noise but might miss valid tiny features; background can be 0 (empty) or other values like 1/8.
 * All attempts so far apply these but fail on shape fidelity; no rotation/flipping, just in-place cleaning.

                objects.append(component)

        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(Helpful in concept: Iteratively removes low-connectivity cells using temp grid; threshold=2 targets protrusions with <2 neighbors; but max_iters=2-3 is too low for complex shapes, leading to incomplete pruning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it applies background detection (works: correctly IDs 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), small object removal (partially works: removes some isolates but misses integrated noise), and protrusion pruning (doesn't work well: leaves jagged edges and doesn't fully clean shapes).
 * Train1: Generated keeps isolated 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) that expected removes or connects; 6's are pruned too aggressively (expected has full row of 6's in row7, but generated has gaps); 2's in rows15-17 are simplified but expected has more connected verticals (e.g., col16 row15/17 missing in generated); overall, shape of '1' (top) is fragmented vs. expected's smoother connections; unknown why row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated (possible over-pruning).
 * Train2: Generated leaves 8's as two separate verticals (rows5-6 cols5-6 and row7 col6), but expected connects them horizontally/vertically with fills (e.g., row4 col6=8 added, row5 col7=8); 4's are mostly kept but expected removes more internals (e.g., row16 col13=4 in generated but 0 in expected, creating hole); 2's are unchanged, matching expected (success there).
 * extract_objects is essential for removal step and works correctly for component sizing.
 * prune_protrusions is helpful but broken in practice: uses current new_g for neighbor checks but temp_g for writes (correct), but threshold=2 removes too many edge cells in irregular shapes; max_iters=3 still insufficient for propagating changes in train1's 1's and 6's; doesn't handle corners well (e.g., removes valid 1-pixel extensions).
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but doesn't catch small protrusions that are part of larger objects (pruning should handle, but fails).
 * Overall attempt shows partial understanding (cleans some noise) but mismatches on shape preservation; no filling of gaps, which expected sometimes implies.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have done minimal cleaning: background=1 correctly identified, but most 6's (rows6-11) and 4's (rows19-21) are left almost intact with only minor prunings (e.g., some 6's in row8 col3-6 removed? Wait, no—generated shows connected 6's but fragmented vs. likely expected clean shapes; row17-18 has 3's kept, but if they are small, should be removed). It looks like over-retention: e.g., the 6-cluster seems like a noisy 'O' or ring but expected probably a solid shape without innards; 4's at bottom look like a '4' with extensions, but generated leaves protrusions (e.g., row21 col7-8=4, possibly thin). Differences: No small objects removed (e.g., isolated 3's in row17-18 should go if <3); pruning didn't smooth the 6's (e.g., row9 col13-16=6 kept, but jagged). This suggests the program under-prunes or has wrong thresholds for this denser grid; doesn't make sense as final clean output since shapes remain noisy compared to training expecteds' simplicity.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image cleanup, where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected objects (likely 8-connected components), remove small noise objects below a certain size threshold, and prune thin protrusions or isolated pixels from larger objects to simplify and reveal clean main shapes, while preserving the overall structure of significant blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals) to group pixels.
 * Small objects (e.g., isolated pixels or tiny clusters) should be removed entirely if below a size threshold (e.g., 3-4 pixels), as they represent noise.
 * Larger objects may have protrusions (e.g., single pixels or thin arms with few neighboring same-color pixels); these should be iteratively pruned if a pixel has fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), but only up to a limited number of iterations to avoid over-pruning core shapes.
 * Subtleties include: not removing parts of large connected objects prematurely (e.g., don't disconnect main blobs); handling cases where noise touches main objects without merging them; ensuring pruning doesn't fill in intentional holes or thin features in expected clean shapes; 8-connectivity is crucial as 4-connectivity might split objects incorrectly; min_size and threshold need tuning per example (e.g., 4 worked partially but not fully); iterations in pruning prevent excessive erosion but can miss multi-step protrusions.
 * Grids are rectangular (consistent width, e.g., 22 columns here), and outputs must match exactly in pixel values and positions.
 * Colors are integers (e.g., 0/1/8 as bg, 1/2/4/6 as objects); same-color components are treated separately.
 * Easy to miss: protrusions might be diagonal or require multiple pruning passes; small objects adjacent to large ones aren't absorbed; expected outputs often fill noise back to bg but retain imperfect shapes if they match the "clean" intent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected component extraction, returns list of pixel lists per object with positions and color; helpful for identifying small vs. large blobs.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This works well for eliminating tiny noise clusters but needs tunable min_size, e.g., 4 in this attempt; doesn't affect large objects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and uses 8-connectivity for extraction, which is a good foundation.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=4 removed some noise (e.g., isolated 1 in ex1 row 3) but failed to remove others, like small 1 protrusions in ex1 rows 4-5 and 9.
 * prune_protrusions with threshold=2 and max_iters=3 partially smoothed shapes (e.g., removed some thin parts in ex1 6's and ex2 2's) but over-pruned or under-pruned: in ex1, left extra 1's in row 4 (generated: 1,1,8 vs. expected: 1,1,1,1? wait, actually mismatched filling); in ex2, failed to remove a single 2 in row 2 col15 and extra 4 in row 16 col13.
 * In ex1, generated retained noisy 1's around the main 1 shape (e.g., row 4 has only two 1's instead of four connected; row 8 has extra 1 in col7), differing from expected by not connecting/filling the main blob properly and leaving protrusions; 6's in rows 5-8 have gaps filled incorrectly (generated row5: 6,6,6,6 vs. expected similar but contextually clean); bottom 2's in rows 14-16 have extra disconnected 2's (e.g., row14 col11 single 2 retained vs. expected removed).
 * In ex2, generated left a small 2 cluster in rows 2-3 (single 2 in row2 col15, trio in row3) which should be part of or removed from main 2 shape (expected starts clean in row2 all 0's, row3 has four 2's); 8's shape is mostly cleaned but generated row5 has extra 8's positions; bottom 4's in row16 retained a single 4 (col13) vs. expected 0 there, and row15 has mismatched 4 positions.
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection; deepcopy is necessary to avoid mutating input.
 * prune_protrusions is somewhat helpful for erosion but broken in implementation: it checks neighbors in original new_g but updates temp_g, which can cause inconsistent counting across iterations; threshold=2 removes pixels with <2 neighbors (i.e., 0-1), but may need >2 for stricter pruning; max_iters=3 is too low for deeper protrusions, leading to incomplete cleanup.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but mismatches in exact pixel positions (e.g., unknown why ex1 row4 doesn't connect 1's fully; ex2 row16 extra 4 persists), suggesting over-reliance on fixed params without shape-specific logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=1, objects in 6/3/4) partially cleans the grid by removing some small noise but retains or incorrectly modifies main shapes, so it does not look fully correct.
 * Upper 6's shape (rows 5-11) has protrusions pruned (e.g., row6 col8-12 simplified to 1's) but leaves thin arms (e.g., row7 col6 single 6? wait, generated row7: 6,6,1's) that might need further removal; compared to mental run of rules (remove <4 size, prune <2 neighbors), it seems to have over-pruned some connections (e.g., row8 col3-6: 6,6,6,6 but expected might retain more for blob integrity).
 * Middle 6's in rows 12-14 look smoothed but row13 has extra 6's in col7-12 that could be protrusion remnants; lower 3's (rows 17-19) retain small cluster (e.g., row17 col17-20: 3,3,3,3 but possibly too small to keep if <4).
 * Bottom 4's (rows 19-22) have the main shape but extra 4 in row18 col6 and thin line in row22 col6-9; overall, output fills much to bg=1 correctly but differences like retained small 3's and unpruned 4 arms suggest incomplete pruning (e.g., why row22 col6-9 not removed if low neighbors? unknown, but it mismatches a clean expectation of solid 4 blob without tails).
 * Test makes partial sense (noise reduced) but not correct, as subtle connections (e.g., diagonal 6's) aren't fully handled, leading to fragmented shapes; to fix, increase min_size to 5 for 3's, raise threshold to 3, or add post-processing for hole filling.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-10-01 02:28:49] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving image processing on a grid of colored cells (representing a pixel art or segmented image), where the goal is to identify the background color, detect and extract connected objects (blobs of the same color), remove noise in the form of small isolated components or protrusions, and simplify or clean the shapes to match a more coherent, expected form—likely by preserving main objects while eliminating artifacts, potentially filling minor gaps or adjusting connectivity without over-pruning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is reliably the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), but objects can be sparse or irregularly shaped, so extraction must use 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right) to group same-color adjacent cells accurately without diagonal connections bleeding into separate objects.
 * Small objects (connected components with size < 2 or < some threshold) should be fully removed by setting them to background, but the threshold may need tuning (e.g., 2 works for obvious noise but misses larger noise in test); subtle elements include not removing legitimate small parts of larger objects.
 * Pruning protrusions iteratively removes cells with fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), simulating erosion to smooth edges, but this can over-remove if iterations are too many (e.g., max_iters=3) or threshold too low, leading to disconnected remnants or total object loss; key subtlety is that pruning should stop when no changes occur or after limited steps to avoid eroding core shapes.
 * Objects may have holes or gaps (e.g., in train1's 1's and 6's, expected fills some 1's to connect arms/legs of a shape; in train2's 8's and 4's, expected adjusts connectivity around gaps); current approach doesn't fill holes (no dilation or closing operation), so shapes remain fragmented—easy to miss that cleaning might require both removal (opening) and filling (closing) for morphological operations.
 * Colors are distinct (1,2,6 in train1; 2,4,8 in train2; 3,4,6 in test), and multiple objects per color should be handled separately; preserve object identity but clean each independently.
 * Grid size is consistent (22x22 in examples), with objects not spanning the entire grid; edge cases include objects touching borders (e.g., test's 4's at bottom-left) or nearly isolated cells that are actually protrusions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs show "intended" shapes (e.g., train1: 1's form a figure with filled body/arms, 6's a compact blob, 2's a small pattern; train2: 8's form a cross-like with filled center, 4's a cleaned shape without inner gaps); over-pruning removes valid parts (e.g., 2's entirely in train1), while under-pruning leaves noise (e.g., scattered 1's in generated train1).
 * All non-background must be processed per color; no color changes except to background; consider 8-connectivity if 4 misses thin connections, but examples suggest 4 is sufficient.
 * Iterations in pruning must use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during scan, as done, but may need more sophisticated neighbor counting (e.g., only object cells count, not background).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; reliable across examples.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This BFS-based extraction of connected components per color is essential and correct for identifying objects; returns list of lists with (row, col, color) tuples, enabling size checks and targeted removal/filling; use it to iterate over objects for cleaning without global scans.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This is helpful for noise removal; works well for tiny isolates but may need higher min_size (e.g., 3-5) for larger noise; integrates well with extract_objects.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**
```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    iter_count = 0
    changed = True
    while changed and iter_count < max_iters:
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        iter_count += 1
    return new_g
```
(This is partially helpful for edge smoothing but broken in practice: it aggressively erodes objects (e.g., removes entire small objects or fragments larger ones like train1's 2's and scattered 1's/6's), doesn't fill gaps (leading to unconnected expected shapes), and the simultaneous update via temp_g still over-prunes with threshold=2/max_iters=3; not ideal without complementary dilation; avoid as-is, or modify to higher threshold (e.g., 3) and fewer iters (1-2).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single (last) submission analyzed; it correctly identifies background and removes some small isolates (e.g., partial cleanup of 6's in train1, tiny 2's in train2) but fails overall on both training examples.
 * Train1: Generated leaves single stray 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) and fragmented 6's (e.g., row5 col16-18 as 6,6,6 but row6 col17 as 8 instead of 6; row7 col16-18 as 6,6,6 but disconnected); removes all 2's (rows15-16 should have a small pattern like two 2's per row in cols16-17); 1's shape is scattered/missing fills (e.g., expected connects row4 cols5-7 as 1,1,1 and fills row9 col6 as 1); differences unknown but likely over-pruning eroded connections without filling.
 * Train2: Generated removes inner 8's partially (e.g., row4 col6 empty instead of 8; row5 col6-7 as 8,8 but row6 col7 empty; row7 col1 empty instead of 8) but leaves outer noise; 2's mostly intact but unchanged; 4's over-pruned (e.g., row14 col10 empty instead of 4; row16 col12-13 as 4,4 but expected has 4,0,0,0; row17 empty where expected has nothing—wait, generated has row16 col12 as 4 but expected row16 col12 empty); differences: fails to fill 8's cross (expected connects row4 col6=8, row5 col5=8? wait no, expected row4 col6 empty but row5 col6=8,row6 col6=8,row7 col1=8? unclear, but generated fragments it); 4's gaps not closed (expected fills row15 col9-10=4,4, row16 col12 empty).
 * extract_objects is essential and works correctly for component detection; integrate it for targeted ops.
 * remove_small_objects helps but min_size=2 is too low (removes valid small parts like train1 2's); increase to 3+.
 * prune_protrusions over-erodes (e.g., train1 loses 2's entirely, fragments 1's/6's; train2 scatters 8's/4's); needs balancing with gap-filling.
 * No filling/hole-closing, missing subtle connections (e.g., train1 row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated; train2 row15 col9-10=4,4 filled).
 * Deepcopy is good for non-destructive edits.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears minimally changed from what the input likely is (assuming similar noise to training), with all major 6's, 3's, and 4's intact but potentially fragmented—e.g., 6's in rows5-11 form a large irregular shape (possibly a figure or letter) with possible gaps (row7 col6=6 but surrounded by 1's; row9 cols3-7=6's connected but row10 col8=6 isolated? no, connected via row10 cols3-7/9-16); 3's in rows17-18 cols19-20 are small (size=4, preserved but maybe noise); 4's in rows18-21 cols4-8 form a shape with possible protrusion (row21 col7-8=1,1 instead of filled 4's?). It matches expected only if no cleaning is needed, but given training failures, it likely misses filling gaps in 6's (e.g., to connect arms/body) and removing 3's as small noise (size=4 >2, so preserved but expected might remove if <5); 4's look under-pruned (protrusions like row21 col6-8 should be smoothed). Overall, output is too raw—pruning didn't remove edges (e.g., jagged 6's in row11 cols7-8=6,6), and no gap-filling (e.g., row12 col7-8 empty where 6's might connect down). To handle test, add dilation after pruning to fill minor holes, raise min_size to 5 for 3's, and use 8-connectivity if 4 misses thin links in 6's/4's.

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to identify a background color and clean up foreground shapes by removing noise, such as isolated pixels or low-connectivity protrusions (e.g., thin arms or single-cell extensions), to produce smoother, more canonical versions of the shapes while preserving their core structure. The process resembles basic morphological operations like erosion but applied selectively to non-background elements based on neighbor connectivity.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color in the grid; non-background colors form distinct "objects" or shapes that need pruning.
 * Use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) for neighbor counting; diagonal neighbors do not count, which can lead to missing subtle connections in diagonal protrusions.
 * Removal threshold is typically <2 same-color neighbors for a pixel to be considered low-connectivity and replaced with background; this targets isolates (0 neighbors) and endpoints of thin lines (1 neighbor), but chains or branches may require multiple iterations to fully propagate removal.
 * Single-pass removal (as in the current code) often fails on longer protrusions because removing an endpoint doesn't immediately affect inner pixels; iterative application (e.g., repeat until no changes) is crucial for deeper cleaning.
 * Shapes may have holes or enclosed areas, but the puzzle focuses on external protrusions rather than filling holes; preserve connected components that form the main body.
 * In training example 1, the expected output connects some 1's that were treated as separate in generated (e.g., filling a gap in the top 1-shape), suggesting the rule might involve minimal connection or assuming implicit filling for blobs; also, the bottom 2-shape in expected has a more compact form with added connections (e.g., row 14 has 2's filled in positions 11 and 15).
 * In training example 2, the 8-shape (likely a small blob or line) is partially preserved in expected but scattered in generated; the 4-shape in expected has internal fills (e.g., row 14 has extra 4 at position 15) and removals of outliers (e.g., row 16 has only a single 4 removed to bg), indicating a need to identify and smooth per-object rather than globally.
 * Subtle element: Some "protrusions" might be part of a larger weakly connected structure; over-removal can disconnect main shapes, so consider component size or distance from core before full erasure.
 * Grids are 22x22 (based on list lengths), with colors as small integers (e.g., 0-8); empty/mostly bg areas are top/bottom, with shapes clustered in middle rows.
 * Potential over-removal: In generated outputs, valid parts of shapes (e.g., corners with exactly 2 neighbors) are sometimes erased if the single pass misorders processing.
 * Easy to miss: The puzzle may require distinguishing "noise" (small objects < certain size) from main shapes; e.g., in train 2, small 8's are kept if they form a minimal shape, but outliers are removed.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies the background color in all cases (8 for train1, 0 for train2, 1 for test).
 * Basic removal works for isolated pixels (0 neighbors), as seen in partial cleanup of 1's and 6's in train1 generated vs. input (though input not shown, inferred from differences).
 * Single-pass low-connectivity removal partially succeeds on short protrusions but fails on longer ones or branches, e.g., in train1, the top 1-shape has a missing connection in row4 (generated: 1,1,8,8,1,1,1 vs expected: 1,1,1,8,1,1,1), leaving a gap unfilled and protrusion not fully pruned.
 * In train1, bottom 2-shape in generated keeps loose structure (e.g., row15: 2,8,8,2,8,8,2,2 vs expected more compact with fills like row14: 8,2,8,8,8,2), indicating failure to propagate removals or add minimal connections.
 * In train2, generated incorrectly preserves scattered 8's (e.g., row5: 8,8 at cols5-6, but expected has them connected and outliers removed like row7 col1 8 gone); also over-removes 4's (e.g., row16: only 4 at col12 vs expected with 4 at col12 but others pruned differently).
 * Train1 mismatches include unexplained fills in expected (e.g., row9 col6: 1 added, row10 col0-5:8's but expected has 1's? Wait, row9 in generated is all 8's except bottom, but expected has 1's in row9 cols4-11? Grids seem misaligned in listing, but core issue is incomplete shape smoothing).
 * Train2 mismatches: 2-shape mostly intact but 8's not fully erased where they should be (generated keeps row4 col14-15 as 2,2 but expected has 8's influencing? No, 8's are separate; generated erases some 8's prematurely).
 * Function `remove_low_connectivity` is helpful but broken in single-pass mode (needs iteration loop); `find_background` is solid and reusable.
 * No per-object extraction used, which might explain global over-pruning; extract_objects could help by processing shapes independently to avoid cross-color interference.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied no removals at all, as the generated grid retains all protrusions and irregular edges in the 6-shape (e.g., row5: 6,6,6,1,1,1,6,6,6,6 with jagged connections), 3-shape (row17: 3,3,3,3), and 4-shape (row18: 4,4,4,4,1,... with extensions in row19), turning the entire grid into a mostly uniform 1-bg with shapes unchanged, unlike the cleaning seen partially in training.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulated): Should prune low-connectivity parts of 6-shape (e.g., single 6's in row6 col5-6 or row7 col6 might be endpoints with <2 neighbors, requiring iteration to smooth into a compact blob); 3's look like a small solid block, likely preserved; 4's have a protrusion in row21 col5-7 (4,4,1,1,...), which should be removed if <2 neighbors, but generated keeps it.
 * Test mismatches suggest the code's threshold or pass fails on complex, multi-row shapes; e.g., inner 6's have 2+ neighbors so aren't removed, but outer ones should propagate inward over iterations, which doesn't happen.
 * Overall, test generated looks like a "no-op" beyond bg identification, missing any smoothing—does not make sense as it ignores the puzzle's apparent goal of protrusion removal.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image denoising and morphological cleaning, where the goal is to identify and remove noise artifacts like small isolated objects, thin protrusions, and disconnected pixels while preserving the core connected shapes of larger objects. The background color (most frequent) should dominate, and operations must avoid over-pruning valid parts of main components, as seen in the mismatches where legitimate structures are partially erased.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most common color in the grid; all cleaning should set non-background pixels to this value only if they qualify as noise.
 * Connected components use 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right); 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonal connections in some shapes, but 4-connectivity appears standard based on expected outputs.
 * Small objects (e.g., size <3 or <2) should be fully removed, but min_size must be tuned carefully to avoid removing parts of larger valid shapes—e.g., in train1, pairs of 1's were removed prematurely.
 * Pruning should target protrusions (pixels with few same-color neighbors), but iteratively with a low threshold (e.g., <2 or <3 neighbors) can erode main bodies if not stopped early; expected outputs show preservation of jagged but connected edges.
 * Objects of different colors are treated separately; pruning/removal applies per color, not globally.
 * Subtle elements: Expected outputs often "fill" or connect implied shapes (e.g., train1's 1's form a more solid blob, train2's 8's and 4's have restored connections), suggesting possible hole-filling or skeletonization isn't needed, but aggressive noise removal might require post-processing to reconnect.
 * Grids are 22x22; edge cases include objects touching borders or spanning multiple rows/columns without full connectivity.
 * Color-specific: Non-bg colors like 1,2,6 in train1 or 2,4,8 in train2 must retain their identity if part of main objects.
 * Avoid over-removal: In expectations, small but structurally important pixels (e.g., single-pixel bridges) are kept if they connect larger parts.
 * Iterations in pruning must converge without infinite loops, using temporary grids to avoid modifying during scan.

(This is essential for identifying components by size/color; used in removal, and could be extended for per-object analysis like bounding boxes or neighbor counts.)

(Useful for smoothing edges, but the attempt's threshold=2 and full iteration over-pruned main shapes; consider limiting iterations or raising threshold to 3 to preserve more structure.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used remove_small_objects with min_size=2 followed by prune_protrusions with threshold=2, which worked for identifying bg correctly (8 in train1, 0 in train2) and extracting objects via flood-fill.
 * What worked: Small isolated pixels/noise were partially removed (e.g., some stray 1's and 2's in train1 reduced), and the iterative pruning loop converged without errors.
 * What didn't work: Over-removal of valid components—e.g., in train1, the 1's blob was reduced to just two pixels at [7,4-5] and [8,4-5], but expected a full connected shape spanning rows 4-9 with ~20+ 1's; 6's were pruned to a partial L-shape instead of full; 2's reduced to two pairs but expected a more distributed pattern.
 * In train2, generated kept fragmented 2's and 4's but failed to restore connections (e.g., 8's at [5,5-6] and [6,5-6] remained but expected includes [4,6] and [7,6]; 4's had gaps filled in expected but not generated, like [14,10-11] connected better).
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection, but wasn't fully leveraged (e.g., could filter by size/shape before pruning).
 * prune_protrusions is conceptually right but broken in aggressiveness—erodes cores (e.g., unknown reason for train1's 1's collapse, possibly due to scanning order exposing inner pixels); not unhelpful, but needs safeguards like max iterations (e.g., 5) or per-object application.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=2 removed too much (e.g., small valid protrusions in 6's of train1); suggest min_size=3-5.
 * Overall, attempt showed understanding of bg detection and component-based cleaning but missed subtlety of preserving connectivity in noisy but structured shapes; no handling for color-specific rules or post-connection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (bg=1) partially cleans noise but does not look correct—it retains fragmented 6's (e.g., rows 5-7 and 9-12) that appear over-pruned compared to likely expected full shapes, similar to train1's 6's issue; 3's are kept as a small pair but might need removal if < min_size; 4's in rows 19-22 form a shape but expected probably connects or smooths the protrusion at [21,6-9].
 * Differences from mental simulation of rules: Assuming rules mirror trainings (remove small objs <3, prune <2 neighbors iteratively but limited), output should preserve larger 6's blob (rows 8-12, cols 3-15) as a solid shape without fragments, remove isolated 3's if size=2, and smooth 4's to a cleaner rectangle without the single 1 at [21,7-8] if it's a protrusion; current output matches bg fill but fragments don't align with expected preservation.
 * Test has multiple colors (6,3,4) on bg=1; output makes sense for aggressive pruning but not for puzzle goal, as it leaves disconnected 6's (e.g., [8,3-7] separate from [9,3-16]) that should connect if noise-removed.
 * To handle test: Increase min_size to 4, raise prune threshold to 3, or add connectivity restoration (e.g., merge nearby same-color components < distance threshold); unknown why 6's fragment so much, but likely over-iteration in pruning.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where the goal is to clean a noisy image by identifying the background color, extracting connected components (objects) of foreground colors, removing small noise objects, and pruning thin or protruding parts of larger objects to reveal clean, intended shapes without over-removing or fragmenting main structures.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background cells as potential objects.
 * Objects are connected components of the same color (4-directional connectivity: up, down, left, right; no diagonals).
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., size <3) to eliminate noise dots or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove cells with fewer than a threshold (e.g., <2) same-color neighbors, but limit iterations (e.g., 2) to avoid eroding main shapes; this targets thin arms or spikes but can accidentally fragment if thresholds are too aggressive.
 * Main shapes may have internal holes or complex boundaries, but the cleaning should preserve overall topology (e.g., don't fill holes or add cells).
 * Colors are distinct per object type; do not merge different colors even if adjacent.
 * Grids are rectangular (e.g., 22x22 in examples), but assume variable size; process row-by-row without assuming fixed dimensions.
 * Subtleties: Connected components must be accurately extracted via BFS/DFS to avoid missing parts; pruning can remove "bridges" between main blobs if they are thin, leading to fragmentation; small objects might be part of larger intended shapes if connected, but examples suggest aggressive noise removal; in train 2, small same-color groups like 8's should be kept if size >= threshold but were partially or incorrectly handled; over-pruning can turn solid shapes into dotted remnants (e.g., 1's in train 1); test case has multiple object types (6's, 3's, 4's) where 3's appear as small noise to remove, while 6's and 4's are main shapes needing minor cleanup.
 * Edge cases: Objects touching borders; isolated single cells; protrusions of length 1-2; components exactly at threshold size.
 * All attempts assume min_size=3 and threshold=2, which works for some noise but fails on borderline cases.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
This correctly identifies the background as the most common color.

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
This is essential: uses BFS for accurate 4-connected same-color component extraction, returning list of objects as lists of (row, col, color) tuples; visited matrix prevents re-processing.

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
Helpful for noise removal: deepcopies grid to avoid mutation, only removes small components entirely.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) provided attempt; it uses background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2 neighbors, max 2 iterations).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test); removes some tiny noise (e.g., isolated 1's in train1); keeps larger components like 6's in train1 and 2's/4's in train2/train test; BFS extraction seems solid for connectivity.
 * What didn't work: In train1, fragmented the main 1's object (generated has disconnected singles/doubles like row4 col5=1, col10-11=1,1; row8 col4-5=1,1 etc., while expected has a solid connected shape spanning rows4-9 with filled areas like row4 col5-7=1,1,1 and row5 col4-6=1,1,8? Wait, expected row5 col4=1,col5=1,col11=1,col12=1; pruning over-removed "thin" parts, turning solid into sparse; also added/kept an erroneous 1 at row9 col6; 2's reduced to tiny 2-cell groups in rows14-15 col16-17, while expected has a structured 2's pattern in rows14-16 cols11-15 like a cross or letter; 6's mostly kept but positions mismatch slightly (e.g., generated row7 col16-18=6,6,6 vs expected row7 col16-20? but close).
 * In train2, incorrectly handled 8's object: generated keeps only partial 8's in rows5-6 cols5-6 (4 cells, forming a small square), but removes others, while expected preserves a connected 5-cell 8's shape across rows4-7 cols6-8 (e.g., expected row4 col7=8, row5 col6=8/col8=8, row6 col6=8/col8=8, row7 col7=8); likely BFS missed connections or pruning eroded it post-removal; 2's and 4's mostly match but 4's in row16 expected has col12=4 but generated has col12=0? Wait, generated row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] vs expected row16: [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]—generated extra 4 at col13, missing intent.
 * Prune_protrusions is helpful but flawed: it only counts 4-directional neighbors and applies globally per iteration, but can remove cells that are part of thin-but-intended features (e.g., bridges in 1's or 8's); temp_g usage is good for safety, but max_iters=2 is too few for complex shapes, leading to incomplete cleaning; it skips bg cells correctly but doesn't handle color-specific pruning well if objects touch.
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but fails if small objects are protrusions of larger ones (since it removes pre-pruning); deepcopy is necessary but copy is slow for large grids.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but over-prunes, leading to fragmentation; thresholds need tuning (e.g., higher min_size or neighbor threshold); no handling for filling gaps or post-processing to reconnect.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct; find_background is correct; prune_protrusions is partially helpful but broken for preserving thin intended parts (e.g., erodes 8's and 1's); remove_small_objects is helpful but should run after or integrated with pruning to avoid removing keepers.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and mirrors training failures: bg=1 is identified right, 6's form two main shapes (one in rows5-7 cols5-6 and scattered, another complex in rows8-12 cols3-15) which seem partially cleaned but fragmented (e.g., row6 col12=1 instead of connected 6? looks like pruning broke connections, similar to train1 1's); 4's in rows18-21 form a clean shape matching likely intent (solid blob row19 cols3-9=4's, with protrusions pruned appropriately); but small 3's in rows17-18 cols18-21 (5 connected cells: (17,19-20)=3,3; (18,18-20)=3,3,3? wait, row18 has 3 at cols18-20, connected vertically/horizontally, size=5 >=3 so kept, but this looks like noise—expected probably removes it entirely as a tiny artifact, unlike main 6's/4's; positions: row17 ends 3,3,1; row18 ends 3,3,3,1—yes, a small L or cluster that should be bg=1). It kept noise (3's) and likely over-pruned 6's (gaps like row7 col12=1 in a 6 area), making shapes incomplete; does not make sense as a clean output—main objects should be solid without small outliers, so adjust to remove size<5 or tune pruning to <3 neighbors.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored pixels (numbers represent colors) where the background is the most common color, and foreground objects form connected components resembling digits (like 1,2,3,4,6,8). The goal is to output a "cleaned" version of the grid by identifying the largest object per digit color, fitting it to a predefined template shape for that digit, scaling the template to the object's bounding box via nearest-neighbor-like sampling, and overwriting the output grid with this scaled template while keeping the background elsewhere—effectively denoising or standardizing irregular digit drawings to match ideal forms.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the most frequent color; all non-background connected components (using 8-connectivity for diagonal connections) of specific digit colors (1,2,3,4,6,8) are candidates, but only the largest (by pixel count) per color is processed to avoid duplicates or noise.
 * Templates are fixed binary grids (1 for foreground, 0 for background) for each digit, defined by relative positions; scaling must map the object's bounding box height/width to the template's, using integer division and clamping (e.g., min(int(i * base_h / ch), base_h - 1)) to sample template pixels, which can cause blocky or imprecise approximations if dimensions don't divide evenly.
 * Only process if object has at least 3 pixels to filter tiny noise; output starts as full background, then overlays scaled templates at the object's min_r/min_c offset—overlaps between objects aren't handled (last one wins), and out-of-bounds is skipped.
 * Subtle issues: Scaling is lossy and doesn't preserve exact shapes (e.g., thin lines become blocks); templates may not match all variations (e.g., no 0,5,7,9); assumes one main digit per color, ignoring multiples; 8-connectivity includes diagonals, which can merge objects unexpectedly if noisy.
 * Easy to miss: Digits might be rotated, stretched unevenly, or partially occluded; background can appear in "holes" of digits (e.g., 8's loops), but extraction treats same-color connected regions as single objects, so holes aren't filled unless template does it; color 5 is missing from templates, so ignored.
 * General: Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples); process only listed colors, leave others as background; ensure visited matrix prevents re-processing.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color by frequency counting.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(di, dj) for di in [-1, 0, 1] for dj in [-1, 0, 1] if not (di == 0 and dj == 0)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected components, returns list of objects as (row, col, color) tuples, filtering out background—helpful for isolating digit-like blobs.)

The main program logic (defaultdict for components by color, selecting max_obj, bounding box calc, template scaling/placement) is partially helpful but flawed in scaling precision and template accuracy.

Unhelpful/broken functions: None explicitly broken, but the scaling loop uses crude int sampling which distorts shapes (e.g., doesn't interpolate); template dict has hardcoded positions that may not generalize to all sizes/orientations—avoid direct reuse without refinement; no function for hole detection or rotation invariance, which isn't needed yet but could be if shapes vary.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/described attempt; it correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and extracts components via 8-connectivity, grouping by color and selecting largest per color.
 * Worked: Basic object detection and placement outline (e.g., in ex1, roughly positions 1's, 6's, 2's in expected areas; in ex2, detects 2's, 8's, 4's clusters).
 * Didn't work: Scaling templates leads to mismatches—e.g., in ex1, generated fills extra pixels in 1's (row3 has 1's where expected is bg; row4 duplicates 1's from row5); 6's in row5-8 have misplaced 1's overlapping or extra fills (e.g., row5 col5-7 has 1's not in expected); 2's in rows14-16 are too filled/blocky vs expected's sparser lines (e.g., row15 gen has 2's at col10-12,14-16 but expected has gaps at col12-14). In ex2, 2's in rows2-6 are overfilled (row2 gen has full 2's row where expected starts row3; row4 gen misses gaps); 8's in rows4-7 are shifted/blocky (row5 gen has 8 at col6-7 but expected has at col6,8); 4's in rows12-16 have extra fills (row15 gen has 4's at col9-10,14-15 but expected has gaps and different shape, row16 gen has isolated 4 at col12 not in expected). Reasons unknown but likely scaling clamping causing uniform blocks instead of lines.
 * extract_objects is essential and works well for blob isolation; templates help standardize but need better scaling (e.g., bilinear interp or exact matching).
 * Train1 mismatches blob shapes due to imprecise scaling (e.g., thin arms become thick); Train2 omits gaps in digits (e.g., 2's curves not hollow).
 * Overall, attempt understands component extraction but fails on template fitting, leading to overpainting and shape distortion.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: Background is 1 (likely correct), but it places a massive horizontal block of 6's across cols3-16 in rows5-15 (e.g., rows5-9 and13-15 full 6's, rows10-12 partial with 1's gaps), which seems like over-scaling a single large 6 template without respecting internal structure—probably merged a wide object into one blob, but expected likely has a more vertical/curvy 6 with holes. Bottom rows16-21 have 4's forming irregular shapes (e.g., row17 col5-8 4's, row18 col3-9 and11 4's, row19 col1 and4-11 4's, rows20-21 scattered 4's), suggesting poor scaling of a 4 template to a noisy bounding box, filling extras where gaps/holes should be; row16 ends with 3's at col18-20, but only three pixels, possibly a tiny 3 object not filtered (under 3px rule?) or misprocessed—expected probably has cleaner, separated digits without bleed. It misses subtle connections or leaves potential overlaps unresolved (e.g., 6's and 4's might interact). To handle test, need refined scaling to preserve template topology (e.g., don't fill holes) and better min size/filter for small 3's; account for large aspect ratios causing horizontal stretches.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean up noisy pixel art or segmented objects, where the goal is to identify and preserve main connected components of non-background colors while removing small noise artifacts and pruning thin or protruding elements that don't form solid shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid; all processing treats it as the "empty" space to fill in removed areas.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) to group adjacent cells, which helps capture irregular but intended shapes but can sometimes over-group noisy pixels.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., 3 cells) to eliminate isolated noise pixels or tiny specks, but this must be tuned to avoid removing parts of legitimate small objects.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove "protrusions" or thin arms by checking neighbor counts (e.g., using 4-connectivity for stricter boundary checks), but limited iterations prevent over-eroding main bodies; threshold (e.g., <2 neighbors) and max iterations (e.g., 3) are key to avoid destroying valid structures.
 * Shapes must be preserved exactly as in the expected output, including holes, branches, or specific topologies (e.g., the '1' and '6' in train 1 form digit-like structures with specific connections; '8' in train 2 has internal loops that shouldn't be filled or removed).
 * Subtle elements: Connectivity rules differ (8 for extraction vs. 4 for pruning) to balance grouping vs. smoothing; over-pruning can disconnect or shrink valid objects (e.g., turning a solid bar into fragments); color-specific processing isn't needed since objects are per-color, but multi-object grids require handling overlaps or adjacencies carefully.
 * All background areas must be uniformly set to the bg color post-processing; no new colors introduced.
 * Grids are rectangular (h x w), and edge cases like objects touching borders or single-cell objects need handling without assuming infinite padding.
 * Iterative changes in pruning must use temporary grids to avoid modifying during the same pass, preventing chain reactions.

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = defaultdict(int)
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] += 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color, essential for all steps.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]

    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This BFS-based extraction of 8-connected components per color is core and helpful for identifying removable objects; it captures positions and colors accurately.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, _ in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This applies the size threshold correctly to noise removal and uses deepcopy to avoid mutating input; tuning min_size is key.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This iteratively smooths edges by removing low-neighbor cells using a temp grid; helpful for protrusions but needs parameter tuning to avoid over-pruning; uses 4-connectivity to be conservative.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown, using background detection, small object removal (min_size=3), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, max_iters=3) in sequence.
 * In train 1, small object removal worked partially (e.g., some isolated 1's and 2's gone), but failed to remove all noise—left a single 1 at [4][11], fragmented the main 1-shape (missing connections like [4][5-7], [5][11-12], [9][6]), kept noisy 6's intact but incomplete (e.g., [5][16-18] as 6,6,6 but expected more structure), and the 2's at bottom are reduced to two pairs but expected a more connected cross-like shape with [14][16], [15][16-17], [16][11,15]; pruning didn't fully connect or clean the 1's and 6's, possibly due to 8-connectivity over-grouping or insufficient iterations.
 * In train 1, the generated grid has extra empty rows (0-3,9-13) matching expected, but core shapes mismatch in topology (e.g., 1's look broken, not forming clean digits).
 * In train 2, small object removal incorrectly removed parts of the 8 (e.g., expected [4][6]=8, [5][6-8]=8,0,8 but generated all 0's except [5][5-6]=8,8; [6][6-8]=8,0,8 became 0,0,0 in some spots? Wait, generated shows [5][5-6]=8,8 but then prunes them away partially), and the 4's are heavily fragmented (e.g., expected solid [15][10-14]=4's with branches, but generated removes [15][12-13]=0,0 and [16][12]=4 but prunes others like [14][11]=0 instead of 4); pruning over-applied, turning valid thin parts into noise.
 * In train 2, the top 2's are preserved well (matching expected), showing small object removal works for clusters >3, but 8's internal structure (like loops) gets eroded.
 * extract_objects is essential and works for identifying components, but combined with pruning, it doesn't preserve expected shapes—possibly needs higher threshold or 8-connectivity in pruning too.
 * The main program chains functions correctly (bg -> remove_small -> prune), but parameters are too aggressive, leading to under-cleaning in some areas (train 1 noise remnants) and over-cleaning in others (train 2 shape loss).
 * No unhelpful functions here—all are relevant, but prune_protrusions is borderline overkill and may need replacement with a more targeted erosion (e.g., morphological operations) if it keeps failing on thin legit parts; deepcopy and temp_g usage is good but could be optimized.
 * Overall, the approach understands noise removal but misses subtlety in preserving exact object topologies, especially for digit-like or branched shapes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have applied the same logic but left excessive noise in the 6's (e.g., scattered 6's in rows 5-11 form irregular clusters like [5][5-7,13], [6][5-7,13], but expected likely a cleaner single shape or removal of protrusions to form a solid object; many single/isolated 6's should be gone per min_size=3, but they're retained and not pruned fully).
 * The 3's at [17][19-20], [18][19-20] are new/preserved but look like small pairs (<3? Wait, 4 cells total, but if connected, might stay; however, expected probably removes them as noise since they're tiny and bottom-placed, unlike main objects).
 * The 4's in rows 19-22 are partially preserved but fragmented (e.g., [19][4-8]=4's solid, [20][4-8]=4's, [21][5-8]=4's, [22][5-7]=4's, but [22][7-8]=1,1 instead of 4's? Generated shows [22][7]=1? No, [22] is [1,1,1,1,1,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]—wait, only up to [5-6]=4,4 then 1's, so pruning cut the bottom row short, missing expected full base).
 * Background is 1 (most common), correctly identified, and top rows are all 1's (good), but mid-section 6's are noisy/unpruned, and bottom 3's/4's are incomplete—suggests the program under-prunes scattered parts but over-prunes edges of larger objects; to handle test, need stricter small removal (maybe min_size=5) or better neighbor checks including diagonals in pruning to preserve branches.
 * Overall, test output makes partial sense for large blobs but fails on fine details, indicating the rules work for gross noise but not subtle shapes—e.g., 6's should form a clean loop or digit, but look jagged.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images where the goal is to preprocess and clean up the grid by identifying a background color, extracting and removing small or noisy connected components (objects), and pruning thin protrusions or isolated parts to reveal or simplify the main intended shapes, likely for object recognition or shape completion in a stylized drawing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, but care must be taken as it may not be zero or a neutral value (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test).
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color; use 8-connectivity for extraction to capture diagonal connections, but 4-connectivity for pruning to avoid over-removal of diagonal structures.
 * Remove small objects below a size threshold (e.g., <4 cells) entirely, as they represent noise; however, this must not fragment larger intended shapes.
 * Pruning should iteratively remove cells with few same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3 in 4 directions) to eliminate protrusions, but limit iterations (e.g., max 2) to avoid eroding core shapes; threshold and iterations need tuning per example.
 * Shapes may need implicit connection or filling (e.g., in train1 expected, some 1's are connected across gaps, and 2's form a specific pattern not fully pruned in generated); subtle elements include handling near-connections or holes, and ensuring color-specific rules (e.g., 8's in train2 form a cross-like shape in expected but are over-removed in generated).
 * Grids are 22x22 based on outputs; assume rectangular and uniform width.
 * Do not alter background cells; preserve large, solid objects but clean their boundaries.
 * Potential for color-specific behaviors (e.g., 6's and 1's interact in train1, 8's and 4's in train2), but rules seem general; watch for overlapping or adjacent objects of different colors.
 * Easy to miss: Generated outputs often leave remnants of small/noisy parts (e.g., isolated 1's in train1) or fail to connect intended blobs (e.g., 1's in row4-9 of train1), and pruning may not handle diagonal protrusions well.
 * In test, background 1's dominate; objects like 6's (large shape), 3's (small pair), and 4's (medium shape) need cleaning, but expected likely removes 3's entirely and prunes 4's/6's to canonical forms without fragmenting.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]  # 8-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential for identifying connected components by color using BFS with 8-connectivity; useful for size-based removal.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 4) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This works for noise removal but may need adjustable min_size; helpful but not sufficient alone.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(This is helpful for removing thin parts but uses 4-connectivity, which may miss diagonals; threshold=2 and max_iters=2 are a starting point but need tuning to avoid over-pruning solid shapes.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only provided attempt (the "last submission"), which combines background detection, small object removal (min_size=4), and protrusion pruning (threshold=2, 4-connectivity, max_iters=2).
 * What worked: Correctly identifies background (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2). Extracts objects with 8-connectivity, allowing proper grouping of diagonally adjacent cells. Removes some small noise in train1 (e.g., isolated 1's reduced but not all). In train2, keeps large 2's and 4's intact while attempting to clean 8's.
 * What didn't work: In train1, failed to fully connect or clean the 1's shape (generated has fragmented 1's in rows 4-8, e.g., single 1 at [4][5], missing connections like expected [4][5-7]=1,1,1 and [5][4-5]=1,1; also left 6's partially pruned but not to expected solid triangle; bottom 2's are two separate pairs instead of expected cross-like [14][11]=2, [15][9-10,12-14,16]=2's in pattern). In train2, over-removed or misconnected 8's (generated has solid [5][5-6]=8,8 and [6][5-6]=8,8 but expected has scattered [4][6]=8, [5][6,8]=8,8, [6][6,8]=8,8, [7][7]=8 with gaps; 4's in rows 12-16 are fragmented, e.g., generated keeps extra 4's at [14][10]=4 and [16][12]=4 that expected removes or repositions). Pruning doesn't handle subtle shape completions (e.g., filling gaps in 1's or 8's). Small objects like potential 3's in test aren't removed if borderline size.
 * extract_objects is essential and correct for component analysis.
 * remove_small_objects is partially helpful but min_size=4 may be too low/high for some noises (e.g., didn't remove all small 1's in train1).
 * prune_protrusions is broken for shapes with diagonals (4-connectivity misses them, leading to incomplete cleaning in train1 6's and train2 8's); not aggressive enough for protrusions in 4's of train2.
 * Overall program chains steps well but parameters (min_size, threshold, iters, connectivity) need per-example or adaptive tuning; doesn't handle shape-specific rules like connecting across single gaps.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it preserves nearly all non-background elements (1 is bg), including the large 6's shape (rows 5-12, which seems like a complex blob but may need pruning to simplify), the small 3's pair (row17-18 cols19-21, size=5>4 so not removed, but expected likely removes as noise), and the 4's shape (rows18-21, kept mostly intact but with potential protrusions like [21][6-8]=4,4,1? wait, [21][5-7?]=4,4,1,1 but listed as 4,4,1,1,1; expected probably prunes to a cleaner form like a triangle or bar without extras).
 * Differences: No removal of small 3's (expected: set to 1's entirely). 6's are unpruned, leaving jagged edges (e.g., [5][5-6,12-13]=6's isolated from main; expected likely connects/simplifies to solid object). 4's have remnants (e.g., [18][4-7]=4's but [21][3]=4? wait, row19 [3-9]=4's solid, but generated keeps all without trimming singles like [21][6?]=1 but pattern suggests over-retention). It looks like minimal cleaning happened since objects are >4 cells, but puzzle requires more aggressive boundary smoothing or gap-filling, making the output too noisy compared to expected clean shapes.
 * To handle test: Increase pruning iterations/threshold or use 8-connectivity in pruning; add gap-filling logic for near-components; remove objects <6-8 size to catch 3's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing a visual image, where the most common value is the background, and other values form connected "objects" or blobs that need cleaning: small objects (under a certain size) are removed, while larger ones have internal gaps filled based on neighborhood rules and protruding or low-connectivity parts pruned to reveal clean shapes. The goal is to output a modified grid with noise removed and shapes standardized, likely for pattern recognition or denoising in a puzzle context.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is determined by the most frequent value in the grid (e.g., 8 in training 1, 0 in training 2, 1 in test); all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Connected components are extracted using 8-connectivity (including diagonals) for identifying blobs of the same value, but filling gaps uses 4-connectivity (orthogonal only) with a threshold of >=3 neighboring cells of the same color to avoid over-filling.
 * Small components (size <3) are entirely removed by setting to background, which handles noise but may miss subtle rules if components are defined differently (e.g., perhaps 4-connectivity for extraction in some cases).
 * For larger components, process within the bounding box: first fill background gaps inside if they have high orthogonal connectivity to the object; then iteratively prune (up to 2 iterations) cells of the object that have <2 neighbors (8-connectivity) to remove thin protrusions or isolated parts.
 * Subtlety: Pruning and filling are done per-component bounding box, which limits scope and prevents interference between objects, but may fail if objects are adjacent or if bounding boxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: The order matters—fill gaps before pruning to avoid removing cells that could connect; also, deep copies are used to avoid modifying during iteration, but multiple iterations of pruning stop early if no changes.
 * Components must be same-value only; different numbers (e.g., 1 and 6) are treated as separate objects, so no merging across colors.
 * Potential issue: The rules seem aimed at "skeletonizing" or "cleaning" shapes to match expected "ideal" forms, but thresholds (e.g., size<3, neighbors>=3 for fill, <2 for prune) may be too aggressive or not tuned, leading to over-pruning or under-filling.
 * Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), but heights/widths vary; assume consistent but verify bounds in all operations.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt (this program) correctly identifies background and extracts 8-connected components, which is essential for isolating objects like the 1's, 6's, 2's, etc., without merging different colors.
 * It successfully removes small components (<3 cells) by setting them to background, which works for obvious noise but may not handle cases where small parts are intended to stay if connected differently.
 * Gap-filling within bounding boxes using 4-connectivity (>=3 orthogonal neighbors) partially works but over-fills in training 1 (e.g., adds extra 1's in row 4 and connects unrelated areas) and under-fills in training 2 (e.g., fails to connect the 8's properly, leaving gaps).
 * Pruning with 8-connectivity (<2 neighbors, up to 2 iterations) removes some protrusions correctly (e.g., isolates some 6's in training 1) but over-prunes in training 1 (removes legs of the 1-shape and distorts 2's) and training 2 (leaves jagged 2's and 4's instead of smoothing).
 * In training 1, generated output keeps too many 1's in noisy positions (e.g., row 3 col 9 is 1 but expected 8; row 6 col 4-5 are 1's but expected connected differently) and fails to fill the 6's gap (row 6 col 18 is 6 but expected filled); 2's are pruned too much (row 15 col 11 is 2 but expected 8? Wait, no—expected has sparse 2's, but generated fills a blob).
 * In training 1, the 1-shape is over-connected and noisy (e.g., extra 1's in row 9 col 10-11), differing from expected clean outline; 6's have extra cells (row 7 col 17=6 but expected 8); 2's form a solid blob in generated but sparse in expected.
 * In training 2, generated adds extra 2's (e.g., row 2 col 15-18=2 but expected starts lower; row 5 col 14-17 over-filled) and fails to prune 8's correctly (row 5 col 5-8=8 but expected sparse); 4's are over-pruned (row 14 col 11-12=4 but expected more connected, row 16 col 12=4 but expected 0).
 * The program processes each component independently, which is good for multi-object grids, but bounding box limits may cause issues if objects are close (e.g., 1's and 6's in training 1 interfere indirectly).
 * Deep copies for temp grids are helpful to avoid iteration bugs, but the fixed 2 pruning iterations may be insufficient for complex shapes.
 * No unhelpful functions noted yet, but the specific thresholds (size<3, fill>=3, prune<2) seem mismatched to the puzzle's expected clean shapes, suggesting they need tuning; extract_components is helpful and should be retained.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to have incorrectly identified 1 as background (filling much of the grid with 1's) but retained distorted versions of 6's, 3's, and 4's, suggesting failed component extraction or over-aggressive filling/pruning.
 * For the 6's (upper middle), generated keeps a partial blob (e.g., rows 5-10 have 6's) but adds extras (row 6 col 5-7=6 but may overfill) and fails to clean connections to background, differing from what should be a clean shape (likely pruned to a simple form based on training patterns).
 * The 4's (bottom left) are partially retained but jagged (e.g., row 18 col 6=4 isolated, row 20 col 4-7=4 but expected smoother outline), and 3's (bottom right) are kept as a block but possibly over-pruned (row 17 col 17-20=3 but may need gap filling).
 * Overall, the test output fills too much with background 1's (e.g., entire top rows are 1's, erasing potential objects) and leaves uncleaned protrusions in 6's/4's, not matching the expected denoising to ideal shapes seen in training (where noise is removed and gaps filled precisely).
 * It does not make sense as a cleaned puzzle output, as it distorts shapes inconsistently (e.g., 6's look like a messy cluster instead of a pruned icon), indicating the program's thresholds fail on denser or larger components.

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving image processing on a grid of colored cells (representing a pixel art or segmented image), where the goal is to identify the background color, detect and extract connected objects (blobs of the same color), remove noise in the form of small isolated components or protrusions, and simplify or clean the shapes to match a more coherent, expected form—likely by preserving main objects while eliminating artifacts, potentially filling minor gaps or adjusting connectivity without over-pruning.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is reliably the most frequent color in the grid (e.g., 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), but objects can be sparse or irregularly shaped, so extraction must use 4-connectivity (up/down/left/right) to group same-color adjacent cells accurately without diagonal connections bleeding into separate objects.
 * Small objects (connected components with size < 2 or < some threshold) should be fully removed by setting them to background, but the threshold may need tuning (e.g., 2 works for obvious noise but misses larger noise in test); subtle elements include not removing legitimate small parts of larger objects.
 * Pruning protrusions iteratively removes cells with fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), simulating erosion to smooth edges, but this can over-remove if iterations are too many (e.g., max_iters=3) or threshold too low, leading to disconnected remnants or total object loss; key subtlety is that pruning should stop when no changes occur or after limited steps to avoid eroding core shapes.
 * Objects may have holes or gaps (e.g., in train1's 1's and 6's, expected fills some 1's to connect arms/legs of a shape; in train2's 8's and 4's, expected adjusts connectivity around gaps); current approach doesn't fill holes (no dilation or closing operation), so shapes remain fragmented—easy to miss that cleaning might require both removal (opening) and filling (closing) for morphological operations.
 * Colors are distinct (1,2,6 in train1; 2,4,8 in train2; 3,4,6 in test), and multiple objects per color should be handled separately; preserve object identity but clean each independently.
 * Grid size is consistent (22x22 in examples), with objects not spanning the entire grid; edge cases include objects touching borders (e.g., test's 4's at bottom-left) or nearly isolated cells that are actually protrusions.
 * Subtle: Expected outputs show "intended" shapes (e.g., train1: 1's form a figure with filled body/arms, 6's a compact blob, 2's a small pattern; train2: 8's form a cross-like with filled center, 4's a cleaned shape without inner gaps); over-pruning removes valid parts (e.g., 2's entirely in train1), while under-pruning leaves noise (e.g., scattered 1's in generated train1).
 * All non-background must be processed per color; no color changes except to background; consider 8-connectivity if 4 misses thin connections, but examples suggest 4 is sufficient.
 * Iterations in pruning must use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during scan, as done, but may need more sophisticated neighbor counting (e.g., only object cells count, not background).

    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the dominant background color via frequency count; reliable across examples.)

```python

    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This BFS-based extraction of connected components per color is essential and correct for identifying objects; returns list of lists with (row, col, color) tuples, enabling size checks and targeted removal/filling; use it to iterate over objects for cleaning without global scans.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This is helpful for noise removal; works well for tiny isolates but may need higher min_size (e.g., 3-5) for larger noise; integrates well with extract_objects.)

**Unhelpful or broken functions:**

    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connectivity
    iter_count = 0
    changed = True
    while changed and iter_count < max_iters:
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        iter_count += 1
    return new_g
```
(This is partially helpful for edge smoothing but broken in practice: it aggressively erodes objects (e.g., removes entire small objects or fragments larger ones like train1's 2's and scattered 1's/6's), doesn't fill gaps (leading to unconnected expected shapes), and the simultaneous update via temp_g still over-prunes with threshold=2/max_iters=3; not ideal without complementary dilation; avoid as-is, or modify to higher threshold (e.g., 3) and fewer iters (1-2).)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single (last) submission analyzed; it correctly identifies background and removes some small isolates (e.g., partial cleanup of 6's in train1, tiny 2's in train2) but fails overall on both training examples.
 * Train1: Generated leaves single stray 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) and fragmented 6's (e.g., row5 col16-18 as 6,6,6 but row6 col17 as 8 instead of 6; row7 col16-18 as 6,6,6 but disconnected); removes all 2's (rows15-16 should have a small pattern like two 2's per row in cols16-17); 1's shape is scattered/missing fills (e.g., expected connects row4 cols5-7 as 1,1,1 and fills row9 col6 as 1); differences unknown but likely over-pruning eroded connections without filling.
 * Train2: Generated removes inner 8's partially (e.g., row4 col6 empty instead of 8; row5 col6-7 as 8,8 but row6 col7 empty; row7 col1 empty instead of 8) but leaves outer noise; 2's mostly intact but unchanged; 4's over-pruned (e.g., row14 col10 empty instead of 4; row16 col12-13 as 4,4 but expected has 4,0,0,0; row17 empty where expected has nothing—wait, generated has row16 col12 as 4 but expected row16 col12 empty); differences: fails to fill 8's cross (expected connects row4 col6=8, row5 col5=8? wait no, expected row4 col6 empty but row5 col6=8,row6 col6=8,row7 col1=8? unclear, but generated fragments it); 4's gaps not closed (expected fills row15 col9-10=4,4, row16 col12 empty).
 * extract_objects is essential and works correctly for component detection; integrate it for targeted ops.
 * remove_small_objects helps but min_size=2 is too low (removes valid small parts like train1 2's); increase to 3+.
 * prune_protrusions over-erodes (e.g., train1 loses 2's entirely, fragments 1's/6's; train2 scatters 8's/4's); needs balancing with gap-filling.
 * No filling/hole-closing, missing subtle connections (e.g., train1 row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated; train2 row15 col9-10=4,4 filled).
 * Deepcopy is good for non-destructive edits.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears minimally changed from what the input likely is (assuming similar noise to training), with all major 6's, 3's, and 4's intact but potentially fragmented—e.g., 6's in rows5-11 form a large irregular shape (possibly a figure or letter) with possible gaps (row7 col6=6 but surrounded by 1's; row9 cols3-7=6's connected but row10 col8=6 isolated? no, connected via row10 cols3-7/9-16); 3's in rows17-18 cols19-20 are small (size=4, preserved but maybe noise); 4's in rows18-21 cols4-8 form a shape with possible protrusion (row21 col7-8=1,1 instead of filled 4's?). It matches expected only if no cleaning is needed, but given training failures, it likely misses filling gaps in 6's (e.g., to connect arms/body) and removing 3's as small noise (size=4 >2, so preserved but expected might remove if <5); 4's look under-pruned (protrusions like row21 col6-8 should be smoothed). Overall, output is too raw—pruning didn't remove edges (e.g., jagged 6's in row11 cols7-8=6,6), and no gap-filling (e.g., row12 col7-8 empty where 6's might connect down). To handle test, add dilation after pruning to fill minor holes, raise min_size to 5 for 3's, and use 8-connectivity if 4 misses thin links in 6's/4's.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing to clean and adjust shapes (objects) represented by colored pixels (numbers), likely to standardize or correct noisy or misaligned drawings by identifying background, extracting and filtering connected components, removing noise, pruning irregularities, and performing targeted positional shifts on specific shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of non-background pixels, extracted using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via flood-fill; 8-connectivity (including diagonals) is used only for neighbor counting in pruning.
 * Remove small objects (connected components < min_size, e.g., 2 pixels) to eliminate noise like isolated pixels or tiny artifacts.
 * Prune protrusions iteratively: remove non-background pixels with fewer than a threshold (e.g., 3) same-color 8-neighbors, up to a max number of iterations (e.g., 2), to smooth out thin extensions or irregularities without affecting core shapes.
 * Specific positional adjustments: For large components (>5 pixels) in upper or bottom regions, shift bounding boxes by removing leftmost column pixels to move x_min right by 1; for small upper components (<20 pixels, min row <10), shift y_min down by 1 by removing top row pixels.
 * Subtleties: Adjustments must be selective (e.g., only upper/bottom, size-based) to avoid over-modifying shapes; connected components must preserve color integrity (only same-color neighbors); iterations in pruning stop early if no changes; grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), with shapes often clustered in upper/middle/bottom sections.
 * Potential pitfalls: Over-pruning can disconnect valid shapes; incorrect connectivity (4 vs 8) affects extraction vs smoothing; heuristic thresholds (size 2/5/20, neighbors 3, iters 2) may need tuning per example; background detection assumes no ties in frequency; shifts assume vertical/horizontal alignment issues in specific regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * Background identification via frequency count works reliably across examples (correctly picks 8 in Train 1, 0 in Train 2).
 * Small object removal (<2 pixels) helps eliminate isolated noise but doesn't address larger irregularities in Train 1 (e.g., lingering thin 1's) or Train 2 (e.g., misplaced 2's persist).
 * Protrusion pruning with 8-neighbor threshold=3 and max_iters=2 smooths some edges but fails to fully correct shapes, e.g., in Train 1 it leaves disconnected 1's in rows 4-9 instead of connecting them as in expected.
 * shift_bounding_box and adjust_pixels_for_y_min are the main failures: In Train 1, they remove too many left/top pixels from the upper 1-shape, resulting in sparse/isolate 1's (e.g., row 4: [...,1,8,...] vs expected connected [...,1,1,1,...]) and incorrect bottom 2's shifted wrong (row 14: [...,2,2,8,...] vs expected scattered [...,2,8,...]); in Train 2, they distort the 2-shape (rows 3-6 show fragmented 2's vs expected more compact) and 4-shape (row 16 has isolated 4's removed incorrectly vs expected partial retention).
 * extract_objects is essential and works for component detection, but relies on 4-connectivity which may miss diagonal connections needed for some shapes.
 * Overall, core pipeline (bg -> remove small -> prune) is solid for noise reduction but positional adjustments are overly aggressive/heuristic, causing mismatches in shape connectivity and position (e.g., Train 1 upper shape not fully connected, bottom 2's not aligned; Train 2 8-shape partially erased incorrectly, assuming it's noise).
 * No divider or full-grid stretch handling needed; focus is on localized shape corrections.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 1 as background (filling top rows entirely with 1's, erasing potential upper shapes), while retaining malformed 6-shapes in rows 5-12 (e.g., row 8: [...,6,6,6,1,...] seems pruned wrong, likely disconnecting a intended blob) and bottom 4/3-shapes (rows 17-21 show 4's but with gaps like row 21: [...,4,4,1,...] vs probable expected smoother form).
 * Issues: Over-removal in upper grid (rows 0-4 all 1's suggests small object removal or pruning erased valid pixels); 6-shape in middle looks fragmented (e.g., isolated 6's in row 7 vs expected connected); bottom 3's in row 16-17 are minimal but 4's in 18-21 seem shifted/pruned incorrectly (e.g., row 20 has extra 4's extending right, possibly from failed bounding box shift). This mirrors training failures, indicating adjustments don't handle vertical/middle shapes well—need criteria for non-upper/bottom objects and better preservation of core connectivity.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing to clean up noisy images by identifying the background color, extracting and removing small connected objects (noise), and pruning protrusions or thin extensions from larger objects to reveal clean, main shapes. The goal is to produce a simplified grid that matches expected clean versions of shapes like letters or symbols formed by colored pixels.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is the most frequent color in the grid; all processing treats non-background as potential objects.
 * Objects are 4-connected components (only up, down, left, right adjacency; no diagonals), same color only.
 * Remove entire connected components smaller than a threshold (e.g., min_size=3) by setting them to background.
 * Pruning removes individual cells that have fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), iteratively, to eliminate spikes or thin protrusions, but preserve thick/main body of objects.
 * Iterations in pruning are limited (e.g., max_iters=2-3) to avoid over-eroding large objects.
 * Subtleties: Pruning can disconnect or alter shapes if threshold/iterations are wrong; e.g., it might remove valid parts of irregular shapes like letters with thin arms. Small objects might be part of larger ones if not fully extracted. In examples, shapes like '1', '6', '2', '4', '8' need to be preserved in specific connected forms, but noise (isolated pixels or tiny clusters) must go. Expected outputs often fill in or connect implied shapes subtly (e.g., extending lines in '1' or closing gaps in '8'), suggesting possible need for minor filling or different connectivity. Grids are rectangular (22x22 in examples), colors are small integers (0-8). Process in stages: background ID -> remove small -> prune, but order matters (pruning after removal prevents re-growth of noise).
 * Easy to miss: Pruning should use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration; over-pruning can remove corners of objects; min_size=3 catches 1-2 pixel noise but might miss valid tiny features; background can be 0 (empty) or other values like 1/8.
 * All attempts so far apply these but fail on shape fidelity; no rotation/flipping, just in-place cleaning.

                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(Helpful: BFS-based connected component labeling for same-color 4-connectivity; essential for identifying objects to remove or analyze; works well but doesn't handle multi-color objects.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(Helpful: Uses extract_objects to remove tiny components; deepcopy prevents side effects; min_size=3 catches common noise but may need tuning for larger noise.)

```python
def prune_protrusions(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, threshold: int = 2, max_iters: int = 2) -> List[List[int]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for _ in range(max_iters):
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < threshold:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
        if not changed:
            break
    return new_g
```
(Helpful in concept: Iteratively removes low-connectivity cells using temp grid; threshold=2 targets protrusions with <2 neighbors; but max_iters=2-3 is too low for complex shapes, leading to incomplete pruning.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it applies background detection (works: correctly IDs 8 in train1, 0 in train2, 1 in test), small object removal (partially works: removes some isolates but misses integrated noise), and protrusion pruning (doesn't work well: leaves jagged edges and doesn't fully clean shapes).
 * Train1: Generated keeps isolated 1's (e.g., row4 col11, row5 col5/11, row6 col5/11) that expected removes or connects; 6's are pruned too aggressively (expected has full row of 6's in row7, but generated has gaps); 2's in rows15-17 are simplified but expected has more connected verticals (e.g., col16 row15/17 missing in generated); overall, shape of '1' (top) is fragmented vs. expected's smoother connections; unknown why row9 col6=1 in expected but 8 in generated (possible over-pruning).
 * Train2: Generated leaves 8's as two separate verticals (rows5-6 cols5-6 and row7 col6), but expected connects them horizontally/vertically with fills (e.g., row4 col6=8 added, row5 col7=8); 4's are mostly kept but expected removes more internals (e.g., row16 col13=4 in generated but 0 in expected, creating hole); 2's are unchanged, matching expected (success there).
 * extract_objects is essential for removal step and works correctly for component sizing.
 * prune_protrusions is helpful but broken in practice: uses current new_g for neighbor checks but temp_g for writes (correct), but threshold=2 removes too many edge cells in irregular shapes; max_iters=3 still insufficient for propagating changes in train1's 1's and 6's; doesn't handle corners well (e.g., removes valid 1-pixel extensions).
 * remove_small_objects works for obvious noise but doesn't catch small protrusions that are part of larger objects (pruning should handle, but fails).
 * Overall attempt shows partial understanding (cleans some noise) but mismatches on shape preservation; no filling of gaps, which expected sometimes implies.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to have done minimal cleaning: background=1 correctly identified, but most 6's (rows6-11) and 4's (rows19-21) are left almost intact with only minor prunings (e.g., some 6's in row8 col3-6 removed? Wait, no—generated shows connected 6's but fragmented vs. likely expected clean shapes; row17-18 has 3's kept, but if they are small, should be removed). It looks like over-retention: e.g., the 6-cluster seems like a noisy 'O' or ring but expected probably a solid shape without innards; 4's at bottom look like a '4' with extensions, but generated leaves protrusions (e.g., row21 col7-8=4, possibly thin). Differences: No small objects removed (e.g., isolated 3's in row17-18 should go if <3); pruning didn't smooth the 6's (e.g., row9 col13-16=6 kept, but jagged). This suggests the program under-prunes or has wrong thresholds for this denser grid; doesn't make sense as final clean output since shapes remain noisy compared to training expecteds' simplicity.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image cleanup, where the goal is to identify the background color, extract connected objects (likely 8-connected components), remove small noise objects below a certain size threshold, and prune thin protrusions or isolated pixels from larger objects to simplify and reveal clean main shapes, while preserving the overall structure of significant blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is the most frequent value in the grid, used to distinguish objects from empty space.
 * Objects are connected components of the same non-background color, using 8-directional connectivity (including diagonals) to group pixels.
 * Small objects (e.g., isolated pixels or tiny clusters) should be removed entirely if below a size threshold (e.g., 3-4 pixels), as they represent noise.
 * Larger objects may have protrusions (e.g., single pixels or thin arms with few neighboring same-color pixels); these should be iteratively pruned if a pixel has fewer than a threshold number of same-color neighbors (e.g., <2 or <3), but only up to a limited number of iterations to avoid over-pruning core shapes.
 * Subtleties include: not removing parts of large connected objects prematurely (e.g., don't disconnect main blobs); handling cases where noise touches main objects without merging them; ensuring pruning doesn't fill in intentional holes or thin features in expected clean shapes; 8-connectivity is crucial as 4-connectivity might split objects incorrectly; min_size and threshold need tuning per example (e.g., 4 worked partially but not fully); iterations in pruning prevent excessive erosion but can miss multi-step protrusions.
 * Grids are rectangular (consistent width, e.g., 22 columns here), and outputs must match exactly in pixel values and positions.
 * Colors are integers (e.g., 0/1/8 as bg, 1/2/4/6 as objects); same-color components are treated separately.
 * Easy to miss: protrusions might be diagonal or require multiple pruning passes; small objects adjacent to large ones aren't absorbed; expected outputs often fill noise back to bg but retain imperfect shapes if they match the "clean" intent.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import deque
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This correctly identifies the most common color as background.)

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[List[Tuple[int, int, int]]]:
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    objects = []
    dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != bg and not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                component = []
                queue = deque([(i, j)])
                visited[i][j] = True
                while queue:
                    x, y = queue.popleft()
                    component.append((x, y, color))
                    for dx, dy in dirs:
                        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                        if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == color:
                            visited[nx][ny] = True
                            queue.append((nx, ny))
                objects.append(component)
    return objects
```
(This is essential: uses BFS for 8-connected component extraction, returns list of pixel lists per object with positions and color; helpful for identifying small vs. large blobs.)

```python
def remove_small_objects(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, min_size: int = 3) -> List[List[int]]:
    objects = extract_objects(g, bg)
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    for obj in objects:
        if len(obj) < min_size:
            for i, j, c in obj:
                new_g[i][j] = bg
    return new_g
```
(This works well for eliminating tiny noise clusters but needs tunable min_size, e.g., 4 in this attempt; doesn't affect large objects.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly identifies background (8 in ex1, 0 in ex2) and uses 8-connectivity for extraction, which is a good foundation.
 * remove_small_objects with min_size=4 removed some noise (e.g., isolated 1 in ex1 row 3) but failed to remove others, like small 1 protrusions in ex1 rows 4-5 and 9.
 * prune_protrusions with threshold=2 and max_iters=3 partially smoothed shapes (e.g., removed some thin parts in ex1 6's and ex2 2's) but over-pruned or under-pruned: in ex1, left extra 1's in row 4 (generated: 1,1,8 vs. expected: 1,1,1,1? wait, actually mismatched filling); in ex2, failed to remove a single 2 in row 2 col15 and extra 4 in row 16 col13.
 * In ex1, generated retained noisy 1's around the main 1 shape (e.g., row 4 has only two 1's instead of four connected; row 8 has extra 1 in col7), differing from expected by not connecting/filling the main blob properly and leaving protrusions; 6's in rows 5-8 have gaps filled incorrectly (generated row5: 6,6,6,6 vs. expected similar but contextually clean); bottom 2's in rows 14-16 have extra disconnected 2's (e.g., row14 col11 single 2 retained vs. expected removed).
 * In ex2, generated left a small 2 cluster in rows 2-3 (single 2 in row2 col15, trio in row3) which should be part of or removed from main 2 shape (expected starts clean in row2 all 0's, row3 has four 2's); 8's shape is mostly cleaned but generated row5 has extra 8's positions; bottom 4's in row16 retained a single 4 (col13) vs. expected 0 there, and row15 has mismatched 4 positions.
 * extract_objects is helpful and correct for component detection; deepcopy is necessary to avoid mutating input.
 * prune_protrusions is somewhat helpful for erosion but broken in implementation: it checks neighbors in original new_g but updates temp_g, which can cause inconsistent counting across iterations; threshold=2 removes pixels with <2 neighbors (i.e., 0-1), but may need >2 for stricter pruning; max_iters=3 is too low for deeper protrusions, leading to incomplete cleanup.
 * Overall, attempt shows understanding of noise removal but mismatches in exact pixel positions (e.g., unknown why ex1 row4 doesn't connect 1's fully; ex2 row16 extra 4 persists), suggesting over-reliance on fixed params without shape-specific logic.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=1, objects in 6/3/4) partially cleans the grid by removing some small noise but retains or incorrectly modifies main shapes, so it does not look fully correct.
 * Upper 6's shape (rows 5-11) has protrusions pruned (e.g., row6 col8-12 simplified to 1's) but leaves thin arms (e.g., row7 col6 single 6? wait, generated row7: 6,6,1's) that might need further removal; compared to mental run of rules (remove <4 size, prune <2 neighbors), it seems to have over-pruned some connections (e.g., row8 col3-6: 6,6,6,6 but expected might retain more for blob integrity).
 * Middle 6's in rows 12-14 look smoothed but row13 has extra 6's in col7-12 that could be protrusion remnants; lower 3's (rows 17-19) retain small cluster (e.g., row17 col17-20: 3,3,3,3 but possibly too small to keep if <4).
 * Bottom 4's (rows 19-22) have the main shape but extra 4 in row18 col6 and thin line in row22 col6-9; overall, output fills much to bg=1 correctly but differences like retained small 3's and unpruned 4 arms suggest incomplete pruning (e.g., why row22 col6-9 not removed if low neighbors? unknown, but it mismatches a clean expectation of solid 4 blob without tails).
 * Test makes partial sense (noise reduced) but not correct, as subtle connections (e.g., diagonal 6's) aren't fully handled, leading to fragmented shapes; to fix, increase min_size to 5 for 3's, raise threshold to 3, or add post-processing for hole filling.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-01 02:37:17] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = find_background(g)
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < 2:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
    return new_g
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-01 02:37:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers representing colors or pixels, where the goal is to identify and preserve meaningful connected "objects" or shapes made of non-background colors while removing noise (isolated or weakly connected cells), resulting in a cleaned grid that reveals structured patterns like letters or symbols. The background is the most common color, and objects must maintain their exact connected forms without erosion or over-removal.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background color is determined by the most frequent number in the grid, which should not be altered; all removals target non-background cells only.
 * Connected components (objects) are groups of the same non-background color that are adjacent (likely 4-directional: up, down, left, right), and the puzzle requires preserving only those that form complete, stable shapes—small or dangling parts (e.g., single cells or lines with <2 same-color neighbors) are noise to be converted to background.
 * Iterative processing is needed to handle chained removals (e.g., removing one cell may cause neighbors to become isolated), but over-iteration can erode valid shapes if connectivity checks are too aggressive.
 * Shapes in expected outputs are symmetric or patterned (e.g., in training 1, 1's form a blocky "E" or similar, 6's a triangle, 2's a small cluster; in training 2, 8's form a vertical line, 2's a shape, 4's a cross-like form), suggesting the rule preserves components with sufficient size or closure, not just minimal connectivity.
 * Subtlety: Directionality matters—only orthogonal neighbors count for connectivity; diagonal doesn't seem to apply based on mismatches.
 * Easy to miss: Valid objects may have internal background or holes, but in these examples, shapes are solid without holes; also, multiple objects of the same color must be treated separately if disconnected.
 * All changes must use a temporary grid to avoid modifying during iteration, to prevent premature neighbor checks.
 * The puzzle likely simulates "corrosion" or "thinning" of noise but stops before damaging core shapes; exact match to expected requires preserving edge cases like protrusions with exactly 2 neighbors.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
import copy

def find_background(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    count = {}
    for row in g:
        for cell in row:
            count[cell] = count.get(cell, 0) + 1
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This function correctly identifies the background color by frequency count and is reliable across examples.)

```python
def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    bg = find_background(g)
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    new_g = copy.deepcopy(g)
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        temp_g = [row[:] for row in new_g]
        for i in range(h):
            for j in range(w):
                if new_g[i][j] == bg:
                    continue
                c = new_g[i][j]
                count = 0
                dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
                for di, dj in dirs:
                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < h and 0 <= nj < w and new_g[ni][nj] == c:
                        count += 1
                if count < 2:
                    temp_g[i][j] = bg
                    changed = True
        new_g = temp_g
    return new_g
```
(This is the core processing function from the attempt; it's helpful for iterative neighbor-based removal but needs tuning, e.g., threshold or component size check, as it erodes too slowly or incorrectly.)

(No other functions like object extraction were provided, but a future `extract_objects` could identify full connected components via flood-fill to check size/shape before removal, e.g., preserve if component has >= certain size or specific topology.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used frequency-based background detection (worked correctly in all cases) and iterative 4-directional neighbor counting to remove non-background cells with <2 same-color neighbors (partially worked by removing some isolates but failed to fully clean noise without preserving exact shapes).
 * In training example 1, generated output incorrectly left remnant 6's (e.g., a partial triangle at rows 6-8, cols 16-18) and 1's (scattered at rows 7-8, cols 4-5) and 2's (small cluster at rows 14-15, cols 16-17), while expected preserves larger, connected 1's (blocky shape spanning rows 4-9, cols 4-12 with internal structure), full 6's triangle (rows 5-7, cols 16-18), and 2's (irregular shape rows 14-16, cols 11-17); difference is over-preservation of small dangling parts and under-removal of noise in 1's area (unknown why 1's weren't fully eroded).
 * In training example 2, generated output kept extra 8's (vertical pair at rows 5-6, col 5-6, which should be removed as they form a small line) and altered 4's (e.g., kept full block at rows 13-16 but mismatched positions like row 14 cols 10-14 vs expected adjusted shape with gaps filled to bg), while 2's were partially correct but noisy; expected removes 8's entirely except structured parts, keeps 2's clean (rows 2-6, cols 15-19), and refines 4's to a specific cross (rows 12-16 with targeted bg fills); difference is failure to propagate removals fully for small components like 8's.
 * The neighbor threshold of <2 removes isolates and ends but misses larger noise clusters (e.g., doesn't handle components of size 3+ that are unstable); using temp grid worked to avoid iteration artifacts.
 * No unhelpful functions were present, but the raw loop without component-size validation (e.g., via flood-fill) is insufficient for shape preservation—consider adding a function to extract and validate full objects by size or bounding box.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it identifies 1 as background (correct, as it's dominant) and removes much noise, but leaves irregular 6's (e.g., scattered in rows 5-12, cols 5-13, forming incomplete shapes like a partial "O" or ring, but with extras at row 7 col 6 and row 11 col 6-7 that should likely be bg) and 4's (horizontal bar at rows 18-21, cols 5-8, but extended incorrectly at row 21 cols 7-8 as 1's instead of full 4's), plus small 3's (pair at rows 16-17, col 19, which seems like noise to remove).
 * Expected output (mentally simulated: assuming rules preserve connected shapes > minimal size, like a large 6's forming a loop or letter in rows 5-12 cols 5-13, clean 4's bar in rows 18-21 cols 5-9 without gaps, and remove 3's as isolates) would have more uniform bg fills in noisy areas; the generated mismatches by under-eroding 6's protrusions and over-filling 4's edges (unknown exact threshold needed, but <2 neighbors isn't aggressive enough for test's denser clusters).
 * Test output makes partial sense for basic noise removal but fails on shape fidelity—e.g., 6's should form a closed or symmetric pattern, not jagged remnants; account for multi-iteration stability or min-component-size (e.g., >=4 cells) to handle test's complex 6's area.
