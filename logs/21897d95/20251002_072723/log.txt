=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 07:27:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 07:36:36] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from itertools import zip_longest

def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Main program: transpose the grid to swap dimensions."""
    return transpose_grid(g)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 07:37:11] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs represented as 2D lists of integers (likely pixel-like values for colors or shapes), where the goal is to transform the input into an output grid that simplifies or reinterprets the visual patterns into large uniform blocks or regions, possibly by identifying and filling connected components, propagating boundaries, or applying symmetry/rotation rules to create stylized, blocky representations. The outputs emphasize horizontal or vertical stripes of consistent values, suggesting rules around region expansion, omission of noise, or mirroring that preserve overall structure but simplify details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently feature large, uniform blocks or stripes of the same number (e.g., rows or sections filled with 7s, 3s, 0s), indicating a need to detect and expand connected regions rather than preserving exact pixel values—subtle noise or small variations in input are likely ignored or filled over.
 * Patterns suggest possible rotation, mirroring, or axis-based propagation (e.g., vertical lines becoming horizontal blocks), but not simple transpose, as outputs maintain aspect ratios and block orientations that align with input visuals rather than just swapping rows/columns.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: small isolated values (e.g., 1s or outliers) are often omitted or absorbed into surrounding blocks, while key structural elements (e.g., dividers or blobs) are preserved and expanded—easy to miss that boundaries might "bleed" or fill adjacent areas.
 * Consider grid dimensions: inputs vary (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), but outputs match input size, so transformations must be in-place or reshaping without dimension change; subtle padding or edge effects may occur in non-square grids.
 * Across examples, dominant values (e.g., 6,7,8) form the bulk of blocks, while minor ones (e.g., 1,0) appear in specific positions like corners or transitions—rules likely prioritize majority regions and suppress minorities unless they form distinct objects.
 * Potential for object extraction: inputs may contain "objects" like shapes or blobs (connected same-value cells), which need to be identified, then redrawn in output with filled interiors or outlines; missing this leads to pixel-level copies instead of abstracted blocks.
 * Symmetry and repetition: many expected outputs repeat rows (e.g., 4 identical rows of 7s), hinting at vertical mirroring or replication of horizontal slices—subtle that this isn't uniform across the grid but segmented by value changes.
 * Noise handling: generated outputs retain scattered small values (e.g., isolated 1s, 0s), but expected clean them up into blocks, so rules must include thresholding or flood-filling.
 * All training examples failed, emphasizing that low-level operations like transpose ignore high-level visual semantics.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used only transposition (zip(*g)), which swapped rows and columns but failed to abstract or fill regions, resulting in jumbled, non-blocky outputs that preserved exact values without simplification—e.g., in Training 1, generated scattered 6s/7s/8s with outliers like 1s/0s, while expected clean horizontal blocks of 7s (top 4 rows), 3s (next 4), and 0s (bottom 4) with precise right-side transitions.
 * Training 1: Generated had vertical stripes of 6s/7s/4s mixed with noise (e.g., row 0: [6]*10 + [7,7,7,8,8,8]), differing from expected uniform rows (e.g., first 4 rows all [7]*10 + [3,3,3,7,7,7]); unknown why transpose produced those specific values, but it mismatched block uniformity and omitted 0-block expansion.
 * Training 2: Generated messy 10x10 with scattered 7s/8s/3s/1s (e.g., row 0: [7,7,7,8]*3), vs. expected top 3 rows of [6]*8 + [7,7], then 5 rows of [3,3,3,8,8,6]*3 + [7,7], and bottom 2 of [3]*3 + [8,8,9,9,9,7,7]; transpose failed to create the repeating 6/8 blocks and introduced irrelevant 1s/5s/9s.
 * Training 3: Generated irregular 9x14 with mixed 6s/5s/3s/4s/1s/8s (e.g., row 0: [6]*9 + [5,9,9,9,5]), vs. expected top 3 rows [5]*5 + [3]*9, then 3 rows [7,8]*3 + [6,3]*3 + [6]*3 + [4]*3, and bottom 3 [7,8]*3 + [6]*7 + [4]*3; differences include failure to group 5s/3s into left blocks and expand 6/4 rights, with generated retaining small 1s/9s as noise.
 * Training 4: Generated 10x10 with scattered 2s/6s/1s/3s/4s (e.g., row 0: [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]), vs. expected top 3 and bottom 3 rows [6]*7 + [2]*3, middle 4 [3]*7 + [2]*3; transpose scrambled into non-uniform rows, missing the alternating 6/3 block pattern and filling outliers like 1s into blocks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs to fill—transpose is broken for this puzzle as it doesn't handle connectivity or abstraction (don't use it in future).
 * All attempts (just one) missed core simplification to blocks, leading to 100% incorrect results; subtle repetition in expected (e.g., identical rows) was ignored.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (30x30? irregular lines suggest non-square, but jumbled with 30 elements per row) does not look correct, as it retains high noise and fragmentation (e.g., row 0: [9]*14 + [6]*14 + [9]*2, but mixes in scattered 3s/0s/1s/8s/2s across rows, creating no clear blocks—in row 12: introduces unrelated [0,1,1,1,6,6,9]* etc., which seems like transposed artifacts).
 * It fails to produce expected blocky structure, likely uniform 9/6/3/0/2/8 regions based on patterns from training (e.g., large top 9-blocks, mid 6/0 stripes, bottom 4/8 fills), instead showing irregular spreads (e.g., 2s clustering mid-right but not expanded, 1s as noise); this doesn't make sense visually, as it looks like raw transpose without filling, missing the puzzle's abstraction to clean, repeating stripes.
 * To handle test, must account for larger/more complex inputs with multiple nested regions (e.g., inner 0/1/2 clusters within 3/9 areas), requiring robust region extraction and expansion rules not present in the attempt.

[2025-10-02 07:37:11] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

```python
from typing import List

def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return transpose_grid(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 07:45:46] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored regions or shapes) are processed into output grids that appear to simplify, fill, or reorganize patterns into larger uniform blocks or structured regions, possibly by identifying connected components, propagating values, or applying symmetry/rotation rules. The goal is to match the exact expected outputs, which often feature repeating rows of consistent numbers forming bands or blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs often create horizontal bands of identical numbers across rows, suggesting a rule for filling or averaging regions vertically/horizontally, but with precise boundaries that preserve some original structure (e.g., in Training 1, top 4 rows are all 7s with a 3-column exception on the right; bottom has 0s transitioning to 3s).
 * Subtle element: Outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate scattered numbers into solid blocks (e.g., in Training 1 expected, 7s dominate upper half, 3s in middle, 0s at bottom with right-side 7s; generated has irregular 6s, 1s, 4s, 9s scattered, ignoring block formation).
 * Connected regions or "blobs" of the same number seem key, but not simple flood-filling—outputs expand or select dominant values per row/column while preserving some irregularities (e.g., Training 2 expected has repeating 6s on left, 3s with 8s/9s on right; generated mixes 7s, 1s, 3s randomly).
 * Dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1 is 12x16, Training 2 is 10x10, Training 3 9x14, Training 4 10x10), so code must handle arbitrary sizes without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Possible rotation or mirroring: Outputs don't match simple transposes, but some vertical alignment suggests row-wise processing or vertical propagation (e.g., Training 4 expected repeats 6s and 3s in blocks; generated has jagged 2s, 1s, 3s).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs aren't just copies or mirrors—some numbers change (e.g., Training 3 generated has 1s/4s where expected has 5s/3s/7s/8s/6s in clean bands), implying selection of min/max or mode per region.
 * All training examples show outputs with high repetition per row, hinting at smoothing or consensus rules across columns.
 * No evidence of object extraction yet, but grids may represent scenes with "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need isolation or transformation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs; do not use in future attempts as it ignores block formation.)

No other functions from attempts; no object extraction or blob detection implemented yet, which may be needed for identifying regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses only transposition, which works for reorienting but fails entirely to match any expected patterns, producing scattered numbers instead of uniform blocks (e.g., Training 1 generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s/3s/4s/9s per row, vs. expected clean 7/3/0 bands with right-side consistency).
 * Train 1 mismatches by scattering original numbers (e.g., generated row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected all 7s except right 3s; unknown why transpose preserves some but jumbles others into non-blocks).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes and values (generated mixes 7s/8s/1s/3s/9s/5s/6s irregularly, e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,...] vs. expected [6,6,...,7,7]; doesn't form the vertical 6/3/8 bands).
 * Train 3 mismatches by introducing unrelated 1s/4s/5s/8s without banding (generated row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected [5,5,...,3,3,...]; row 3 has jagged 3/1/4/6/8 vs. expected 7/8/6/3/4 bands—unknown reason for value shifts).
 * Train 4 mismatches row repetitions and block edges (generated has varying 2/6/1/3 per row, e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,...] vs. expected all [6,6,...,2,2,2]; doesn't capture the alternating 6/3/2 bands).
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, missing core need to detect/ fill blobs (essential for future, as grids likely contain distinct shapes).
 * Transpose function is incorrect and not relevant (scrambles without insight; avoid in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears to be a direct (or near-direct) transpose of an unseen input grid, resulting in highly irregular rows with mixed numbers (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s; row 12 introduces 1s/0s scattered amid 9s/6s; later rows have 7s/4s/8s in non-uniform patterns like [9,9,7,7,...1,9,...]).
 * It lacks the uniform banding seen in all expected training outputs (e.g., no repeating identical rows or solid blocks of 6s/3s/9s/8s; instead, jagged edges and intrusions like single 1s or 0s disrupt potential regions, e.g., row 6 has [9,9,9,3,3,3,3,1,8,0,...] vs. what should likely be cleaner horizontal fills).
 * Doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it preserves input noise (scattered 0/1/2/3/8) without consolidation, suggesting no rule application—just mechanical swap; expected test should have structured bands (e.g., large 9/6 areas filled solidly, with transitions like training examples).
 * To handle test, future code must detect and expand dominant numbers per column/row, ignoring isolates; account for larger size (~30x30?) with varying blob densities.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 07:45:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs represented as 2D lists of integers (likely pixel-like values for colors or shapes), where the goal is to transform the input into an output grid that simplifies or reinterprets the visual patterns into large uniform blocks or regions, possibly by identifying and filling connected components, propagating boundaries, or applying symmetry/rotation rules to create stylized, blocky representations. The outputs emphasize horizontal or vertical stripes of consistent values, suggesting rules around region expansion, omission of noise, or mirroring that preserve overall structure but simplify details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently feature large, uniform blocks or stripes of the same number (e.g., rows or sections filled with 7s, 3s, 0s), indicating a need to detect and expand connected regions rather than preserving exact pixel values—subtle noise or small variations in input are likely ignored or filled over.
 * Patterns suggest possible rotation, mirroring, or axis-based propagation (e.g., vertical lines becoming horizontal blocks), but not simple transpose, as outputs maintain aspect ratios and block orientations that align with input visuals rather than just swapping rows/columns.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: small isolated values (e.g., 1s or outliers) are often omitted or absorbed into surrounding blocks, while key structural elements (e.g., dividers or blobs) are preserved and expanded—easy to miss that boundaries might "bleed" or fill adjacent areas.
 * Consider grid dimensions: inputs vary (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), but outputs match input size, so transformations must be in-place or reshaping without dimension change; subtle padding or edge effects may occur in non-square grids.
 * Across examples, dominant values (e.g., 6,7,8) form the bulk of blocks, while minor ones (e.g., 1,0) appear in specific positions like corners or transitions—rules likely prioritize majority regions and suppress minorities unless they form distinct objects.
 * Potential for object extraction: inputs may contain "objects" like shapes or blobs (connected same-value cells), which need to be identified, then redrawn in output with filled interiors or outlines; missing this leads to pixel-level copies instead of abstracted blocks.
 * Symmetry and repetition: many expected outputs repeat rows (e.g., 4 identical rows of 7s), hinting at vertical mirroring or replication of horizontal slices—subtle that this isn't uniform across the grid but segmented by value changes.
 * Noise handling: generated outputs retain scattered small values (e.g., isolated 1s, 0s), but expected clean them up into blocks, so rules must include thresholding or flood-filling.
 * All training examples failed, emphasizing that low-level operations like transpose ignore high-level visual semantics.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used only transposition (zip(*g)), which swapped rows and columns but failed to abstract or fill regions, resulting in jumbled, non-blocky outputs that preserved exact values without simplification—e.g., in Training 1, generated scattered 6s/7s/8s with outliers like 1s/0s, while expected clean horizontal blocks of 7s (top 4 rows), 3s (next 4), and 0s (bottom 4) with precise right-side transitions.
 * Training 1: Generated had vertical stripes of 6s/7s/4s mixed with noise (e.g., row 0: [6]*10 + [7,7,7,8,8,8]), differing from expected uniform rows (e.g., first 4 rows all [7]*10 + [3,3,3,7,7,7]); unknown why transpose produced those specific values, but it mismatched block uniformity and omitted 0-block expansion.
 * Training 2: Generated messy 10x10 with scattered 7s/8s/3s/1s (e.g., row 0: [7,7,7,8]*3), vs. expected top 3 rows of [6]*8 + [7,7], then 5 rows of [3,3,3,8,8,6]*3 + [7,7], and bottom 2 of [3]*3 + [8,8,9,9,9,7,7]; transpose failed to create the repeating 6/8 blocks and introduced irrelevant 1s/5s/9s.
 * Training 3: Generated irregular 9x14 with mixed 6s/5s/3s/4s/1s/8s (e.g., row 0: [6]*9 + [5,9,9,9,5]), vs. expected top 3 rows [5]*5 + [3]*9, then 3 rows [7,8]*3 + [6,3]*3 + [6]*3 + [4]*3, and bottom 3 [7,8]*3 + [6]*7 + [4]*3; differences include failure to group 5s/3s into left blocks and expand 6/4 rights, with generated retaining small 1s/9s as noise.
 * Training 4: Generated 10x10 with scattered 2s/6s/1s/3s/4s (e.g., row 0: [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]), vs. expected top 3 and bottom 3 rows [6]*7 + [2]*3, middle 4 [3]*7 + [2]*3; transpose scrambled into non-uniform rows, missing the alternating 6/3 block pattern and filling outliers like 1s into blocks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs to fill—transpose is broken for this puzzle as it doesn't handle connectivity or abstraction (don't use it in future).
 * All attempts (just one) missed core simplification to blocks, leading to 100% incorrect results; subtle repetition in expected (e.g., identical rows) was ignored.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (30x30? irregular lines suggest non-square, but jumbled with 30 elements per row) does not look correct, as it retains high noise and fragmentation (e.g., row 0: [9]*14 + [6]*14 + [9]*2, but mixes in scattered 3s/0s/1s/8s/2s across rows, creating no clear blocks—in row 12: introduces unrelated [0,1,1,1,6,6,9]* etc., which seems like transposed artifacts).
 * It fails to produce expected blocky structure, likely uniform 9/6/3/0/2/8 regions based on patterns from training (e.g., large top 9-blocks, mid 6/0 stripes, bottom 4/8 fills), instead showing irregular spreads (e.g., 2s clustering mid-right but not expanded, 1s as noise); this doesn't make sense visually, as it looks like raw transpose without filling, missing the puzzle's abstraction to clean, repeating stripes.
 * To handle test, must account for larger/more complex inputs with multiple nested regions (e.g., inner 0/1/2 clusters within 3/9 areas), requiring robust region extraction and expansion rules not present in the attempt.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored regions or shapes) are processed into output grids that appear to simplify, fill, or reorganize patterns into larger uniform blocks or structured regions, possibly by identifying connected components, propagating values, or applying symmetry/rotation rules. The goal is to match the exact expected outputs, which often feature repeating rows of consistent numbers forming bands or blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs often create horizontal bands of identical numbers across rows, suggesting a rule for filling or averaging regions vertically/horizontally, but with precise boundaries that preserve some original structure (e.g., in Training 1, top 4 rows are all 7s with a 3-column exception on the right; bottom has 0s transitioning to 3s).
 * Subtle element: Outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate scattered numbers into solid blocks (e.g., in Training 1 expected, 7s dominate upper half, 3s in middle, 0s at bottom with right-side 7s; generated has irregular 6s, 1s, 4s, 9s scattered, ignoring block formation).
 * Connected regions or "blobs" of the same number seem key, but not simple flood-filling—outputs expand or select dominant values per row/column while preserving some irregularities (e.g., Training 2 expected has repeating 6s on left, 3s with 8s/9s on right; generated mixes 7s, 1s, 3s randomly).
 * Dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1 is 12x16, Training 2 is 10x10, Training 3 9x14, Training 4 10x10), so code must handle arbitrary sizes without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Possible rotation or mirroring: Outputs don't match simple transposes, but some vertical alignment suggests row-wise processing or vertical propagation (e.g., Training 4 expected repeats 6s and 3s in blocks; generated has jagged 2s, 1s, 3s).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs aren't just copies or mirrors—some numbers change (e.g., Training 3 generated has 1s/4s where expected has 5s/3s/7s/8s/6s in clean bands), implying selection of min/max or mode per region.
 * All training examples show outputs with high repetition per row, hinting at smoothing or consensus rules across columns.
 * No evidence of object extraction yet, but grids may represent scenes with "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need isolation or transformation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs; do not use in future attempts as it ignores block formation.)

No other functions from attempts; no object extraction or blob detection implemented yet, which may be needed for identifying regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses only transposition, which works for reorienting but fails entirely to match any expected patterns, producing scattered numbers instead of uniform blocks (e.g., Training 1 generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s/3s/4s/9s per row, vs. expected clean 7/3/0 bands with right-side consistency).
 * Train 1 mismatches by scattering original numbers (e.g., generated row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected all 7s except right 3s; unknown why transpose preserves some but jumbles others into non-blocks).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes and values (generated mixes 7s/8s/1s/3s/9s/5s/6s irregularly, e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,...] vs. expected [6,6,...,7,7]; doesn't form the vertical 6/3/8 bands).
 * Train 3 mismatches by introducing unrelated 1s/4s/5s/8s without banding (generated row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected [5,5,...,3,3,...]; row 3 has jagged 3/1/4/6/8 vs. expected 7/8/6/3/4 bands—unknown reason for value shifts).
 * Train 4 mismatches row repetitions and block edges (generated has varying 2/6/1/3 per row, e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,...] vs. expected all [6,6,...,2,2,2]; doesn't capture the alternating 6/3/2 bands).
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, missing core need to detect/ fill blobs (essential for future, as grids likely contain distinct shapes).
 * Transpose function is incorrect and not relevant (scrambles without insight; avoid in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears to be a direct (or near-direct) transpose of an unseen input grid, resulting in highly irregular rows with mixed numbers (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s; row 12 introduces 1s/0s scattered amid 9s/6s; later rows have 7s/4s/8s in non-uniform patterns like [9,9,7,7,...1,9,...]).
 * It lacks the uniform banding seen in all expected training outputs (e.g., no repeating identical rows or solid blocks of 6s/3s/9s/8s; instead, jagged edges and intrusions like single 1s or 0s disrupt potential regions, e.g., row 6 has [9,9,9,3,3,3,3,1,8,0,...] vs. what should likely be cleaner horizontal fills).
 * Doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it preserves input noise (scattered 0/1/2/3/8) without consolidation, suggesting no rule application—just mechanical swap; expected test should have structured bands (e.g., large 9/6 areas filled solidly, with transitions like training examples).
 * To handle test, future code must detect and expand dominant numbers per column/row, ignoring isolates; account for larger size (~30x30?) with varying blob densities.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 07:58:44] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected regions (blobs) of the same numerical value in a 2D grid, likely to simplify or reconstruct patterns such as filling bounding boxes or transforming shapes while preserving some structural rules, but the exact transformation rules (e.g., value mapping, region selection criteria, or output grid initialization) remain unclear from the failed attempts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are connected components of the same value, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via DFS or BFS, but only large regions (>=3 cells) are considered, ignoring noise/single cells or small groups.
 * The grid is transposed (rows become columns) before processing, which may be intended to rotate or reorient the puzzle for analysis, but this step appears to contribute to mismatches in orientation and positioning.
 * Regions are sorted by size (number of cells) in decreasing order, and their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) are filled with the region's value on a fresh zero-initialized grid; however, this overwrites smaller regions with larger ones, leading to loss of detail and incorrect value placements.
 * Expected outputs show clean, block-like patterns with specific values (e.g., large uniform areas of 7s, 3s, 0s in training 1; structured bands of 6s, 3s, 8s in training 2), suggesting the puzzle may involve value remapping, selective filling without full overwrites, or different connectivity (e.g., 8-connectivity including diagonals).
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must match exact positions and values without extraneous numbers (e.g., generated includes 1s, 4s, 9s where expected has 0s or 3s); zero areas in expectations indicate unfilled or background spaces; patterns suggest vertical/horizontal banding or shape extension, not just BBox filling.
 * Considerations across attempts: No rotation or mirroring beyond transpose; no handling of value-specific rules (e.g., some values like 0 or 1 might be treated as background); potential need to process original grid without transpose or combine multiple steps; small regions might actually be important in some cases despite the >=3 filter; overlapping BBoxes cause generated outputs to have irregular, non-blocky shapes unlike expectations.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import defaultdict

class GridRegion:
    def __init__(self, value: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]):
        self.value = value
        self.positions = positions
        self.bbox = self._compute_bbox()

    def _compute_bbox(self) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
        if not self.positions:
            return 0, 0, 0, 0
        rows = [p[0] for p in self.positions]
        cols = [p[1] for p in self.positions]
        return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(This class is helpful for representing regions with positions and bounding boxes, useful for any blob extraction.)

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This is a standard utility for grid rotation, potentially useful if orientation matters, but may not be needed in all cases.)

```python
def extract_regions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[GridRegion]]:
    """Extract connected components (regions/blobs) of same value using flood-fill or DFS/BFS.
    Returns dict of value -> list of regions. Ignore single-cell noise if len(positions) < 3."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return {}
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    regions = defaultdict(list)

    def dfs(r: int, c: int, val: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]):
        stack = [(r, c)]
        while stack:
            cr, cc = stack.pop()
            if 0 <= cr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols and not visited[cr][cc] and g[cr][cc] == val:
                visited[cr][cc] = True

                stack.append((cr - 1, cc))
                stack.append((cr + 1, cc))
                stack.append((cr, cc - 1))
                stack.append((cr, cc + 1))

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c]:
                val = g[r][c]
                positions = []
                dfs(r, c, val, positions)
                if len(positions) >= 3:
                    regions[val].append(GridRegion(val, positions))
    return regions
```
(This DFS-based extraction is core and helpful for identifying connected regions, though the size threshold and 4-connectivity might need adjustment; it's essential for blob detection in visual puzzles.)

```python
def fill_large_regions(g: List[List[int]], regions: Dict[int, List[GridRegion]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill bounding boxes of large regions in order of decreasing size on a zero-initialized grid."""
    all_regions = []
    for val, reg_list in regions.items():
        all_regions.extend(reg_list)
    all_regions.sort(key=lambda rg: len(rg.positions), reverse=True)
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    output = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    for region in all_regions:
        min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = region.bbox
        for rr in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
            for cc in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
                if 0 <= rr < h and 0 <= cc < w:
                    output[rr][cc] = region.value
    return output
```
(This filling logic is somewhat helpful for reconstructing from BBoxes but is flawed as it overwrites without preserving original details or handling overlaps correctly; consider modifying to avoid full overwrites or use union of regions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed, indicating the core logic (transpose + extract large regions + size-ordered BBox fill on zero grid) does not capture the puzzle's transformation rules.
 * In training 1, generated a top-heavy grid with horizontal bands of 6s, 7s, 4s mixed with small 1s, 8s, 9s, but expected vertical bands of 7s transitioning to 3s and bottom 0s; the transpose likely rotated patterns incorrectly, and BBox filling created unwanted extensions (e.g., 6s where 7s expected), while ignoring small regions lost key separators.
 * In training 2, generated irregular shapes with 7s, 8s, 1s, 3s, 0s, 5s scattered (e.g., small 1s blobs and partial 8s bands), but expected clean horizontal bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, 9s with no small intrusions; size ordering overwrote smaller features like 1s incorrectly, and value mismatch (e.g., 7s instead of 6s) suggests no remapping.
 * In training 3, generated a jumbled mix of 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s, 8s, 5s, 9s with broken lines (e.g., interrupted 4s and 1s blobs), but expected structured rows of 5s/3s transitioning to 7/8/6/4 bands; BBox filling expanded regions too much (e.g., full rows of 6s where partial expected), and transpose misaligned vertical elements.
 * In training 4, generated overlapping 2s, 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s in non-block forms (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s and partial 6s), but expected repeating horizontal blocks of 6s, 3s, 2s; the approach captured some large blobs but failed to extend or clean them into uniform bands, with small 1s regions incorrectly preserved/included.
 * Transpose_grid is helpful but likely unnecessary or wrongly applied, as it consistently rotates patterns away from expected orientations.
 * extract_regions is essential and mostly correct for blob detection but misses subtleties like including smaller regions (<3 cells) or using 8-connectivity; the >=3 filter discards potentially important small features (e.g., 1s in trainings).
 * fill_large_regions is broken/not helpful as-is, because size-ordered overwriting creates artifacts (e.g., large BBoxes erase smaller ones entirely, leading to uniform blocks where mixed or zero areas expected); don't use without modifications like layering or selective filling.
 * Overall, no value remapping or background handling (e.g., propagating 0s), and no consideration for puzzle-specific rules like extending shapes to grid edges or ignoring certain values.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears chaotic/incoherent compared to the structured, blocky expectations from trainings; it has massive horizontal bands of 9s at top/bottom, vertical columns of 6s on the right, irregular intrusions of 3s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 7s, 8s scattered in the middle (e.g., small 1s/2s blobs amid 0s, partial 4s bands overwritten by 8s), creating a non-patterned mess rather than clean regions.
 * It over-relies on BBox filling, expanding large 9s and 6s to dominate while leaving noisy small regions (e.g., isolated 1s/2s where zeros or unified blocks might be expected), and the transpose likely misorients the input's vertical/horizontal features.
 * The output mismatches potential expected clean divisions (e.g., no full zero backgrounds or value shifts like 3-to-0 transitions seen in training 1), with unknown reasons for specific value appearances (e.g., why 4s and 7s emerge); it does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it lacks the banded, uniform structure of expectations—likely needs rules for non-overwriting fills, value substitution, or no transpose to handle the test case's wider grid.

[2025-10-02 07:58:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs represented as 2D lists of integers (likely pixel-like values for colors or shapes), where the goal is to transform the input into an output grid that simplifies or reinterprets the visual patterns into large uniform blocks or regions, possibly by identifying and filling connected components, propagating boundaries, or applying symmetry/rotation rules to create stylized, blocky representations. The outputs emphasize horizontal or vertical stripes of consistent values, suggesting rules around region expansion, omission of noise, or mirroring that preserve overall structure but simplify details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently feature large, uniform blocks or stripes of the same number (e.g., rows or sections filled with 7s, 3s, 0s), indicating a need to detect and expand connected regions rather than preserving exact pixel values—subtle noise or small variations in input are likely ignored or filled over.
 * Patterns suggest possible rotation, mirroring, or axis-based propagation (e.g., vertical lines becoming horizontal blocks), but not simple transpose, as outputs maintain aspect ratios and block orientations that align with input visuals rather than just swapping rows/columns.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: small isolated values (e.g., 1s or outliers) are often omitted or absorbed into surrounding blocks, while key structural elements (e.g., dividers or blobs) are preserved and expanded—easy to miss that boundaries might "bleed" or fill adjacent areas.
 * Consider grid dimensions: inputs vary (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), but outputs match input size, so transformations must be in-place or reshaping without dimension change; subtle padding or edge effects may occur in non-square grids.
 * Across examples, dominant values (e.g., 6,7,8) form the bulk of blocks, while minor ones (e.g., 1,0) appear in specific positions like corners or transitions—rules likely prioritize majority regions and suppress minorities unless they form distinct objects.
 * Potential for object extraction: inputs may contain "objects" like shapes or blobs (connected same-value cells), which need to be identified, then redrawn in output with filled interiors or outlines; missing this leads to pixel-level copies instead of abstracted blocks.
 * Symmetry and repetition: many expected outputs repeat rows (e.g., 4 identical rows of 7s), hinting at vertical mirroring or replication of horizontal slices—subtle that this isn't uniform across the grid but segmented by value changes.
 * Noise handling: generated outputs retain scattered small values (e.g., isolated 1s, 0s), but expected clean them up into blocks, so rules must include thresholding or flood-filling.
 * All training examples failed, emphasizing that low-level operations like transpose ignore high-level visual semantics.

    return output
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used only transposition (zip(*g)), which swapped rows and columns but failed to abstract or fill regions, resulting in jumbled, non-blocky outputs that preserved exact values without simplification—e.g., in Training 1, generated scattered 6s/7s/8s with outliers like 1s/0s, while expected clean horizontal blocks of 7s (top 4 rows), 3s (next 4), and 0s (bottom 4) with precise right-side transitions.
 * Training 1: Generated had vertical stripes of 6s/7s/4s mixed with noise (e.g., row 0: [6]*10 + [7,7,7,8,8,8]), differing from expected uniform rows (e.g., first 4 rows all [7]*10 + [3,3,3,7,7,7]); unknown why transpose produced those specific values, but it mismatched block uniformity and omitted 0-block expansion.
 * Training 2: Generated messy 10x10 with scattered 7s/8s/3s/1s (e.g., row 0: [7,7,7,8]*3), vs. expected top 3 rows of [6]*8 + [7,7], then 5 rows of [3,3,3,8,8,6]*3 + [7,7], and bottom 2 of [3]*3 + [8,8,9,9,9,7,7]; transpose failed to create the repeating 6/8 blocks and introduced irrelevant 1s/5s/9s.
 * Training 3: Generated irregular 9x14 with mixed 6s/5s/3s/4s/1s/8s (e.g., row 0: [6]*9 + [5,9,9,9,5]), vs. expected top 3 rows [5]*5 + [3]*9, then 3 rows [7,8]*3 + [6,3]*3 + [6]*3 + [4]*3, and bottom 3 [7,8]*3 + [6]*7 + [4]*3; differences include failure to group 5s/3s into left blocks and expand 6/4 rights, with generated retaining small 1s/9s as noise.
 * Training 4: Generated 10x10 with scattered 2s/6s/1s/3s/4s (e.g., row 0: [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]), vs. expected top 3 and bottom 3 rows [6]*7 + [2]*3, middle 4 [3]*7 + [2]*3; transpose scrambled into non-uniform rows, missing the alternating 6/3 block pattern and filling outliers like 1s into blocks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs to fill—transpose is broken for this puzzle as it doesn't handle connectivity or abstraction (don't use it in future).
 * All attempts (just one) missed core simplification to blocks, leading to 100% incorrect results; subtle repetition in expected (e.g., identical rows) was ignored.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (30x30? irregular lines suggest non-square, but jumbled with 30 elements per row) does not look correct, as it retains high noise and fragmentation (e.g., row 0: [9]*14 + [6]*14 + [9]*2, but mixes in scattered 3s/0s/1s/8s/2s across rows, creating no clear blocks—in row 12: introduces unrelated [0,1,1,1,6,6,9]* etc., which seems like transposed artifacts).
 * It fails to produce expected blocky structure, likely uniform 9/6/3/0/2/8 regions based on patterns from training (e.g., large top 9-blocks, mid 6/0 stripes, bottom 4/8 fills), instead showing irregular spreads (e.g., 2s clustering mid-right but not expanded, 1s as noise); this doesn't make sense visually, as it looks like raw transpose without filling, missing the puzzle's abstraction to clean, repeating stripes.
 * To handle test, must account for larger/more complex inputs with multiple nested regions (e.g., inner 0/1/2 clusters within 3/9 areas), requiring robust region extraction and expansion rules not present in the attempt.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored regions or shapes) are processed into output grids that appear to simplify, fill, or reorganize patterns into larger uniform blocks or structured regions, possibly by identifying connected components, propagating values, or applying symmetry/rotation rules. The goal is to match the exact expected outputs, which often feature repeating rows of consistent numbers forming bands or blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs often create horizontal bands of identical numbers across rows, suggesting a rule for filling or averaging regions vertically/horizontally, but with precise boundaries that preserve some original structure (e.g., in Training 1, top 4 rows are all 7s with a 3-column exception on the right; bottom has 0s transitioning to 3s).
 * Subtle element: Outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate scattered numbers into solid blocks (e.g., in Training 1 expected, 7s dominate upper half, 3s in middle, 0s at bottom with right-side 7s; generated has irregular 6s, 1s, 4s, 9s scattered, ignoring block formation).
 * Connected regions or "blobs" of the same number seem key, but not simple flood-filling—outputs expand or select dominant values per row/column while preserving some irregularities (e.g., Training 2 expected has repeating 6s on left, 3s with 8s/9s on right; generated mixes 7s, 1s, 3s randomly).
 * Dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1 is 12x16, Training 2 is 10x10, Training 3 9x14, Training 4 10x10), so code must handle arbitrary sizes without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Possible rotation or mirroring: Outputs don't match simple transposes, but some vertical alignment suggests row-wise processing or vertical propagation (e.g., Training 4 expected repeats 6s and 3s in blocks; generated has jagged 2s, 1s, 3s).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs aren't just copies or mirrors—some numbers change (e.g., Training 3 generated has 1s/4s where expected has 5s/3s/7s/8s/6s in clean bands), implying selection of min/max or mode per region.
 * All training examples show outputs with high repetition per row, hinting at smoothing or consensus rules across columns.
 * No evidence of object extraction yet, but grids may represent scenes with "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need isolation or transformation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs; do not use in future attempts as it ignores block formation.)

No other functions from attempts; no object extraction or blob detection implemented yet, which may be needed for identifying regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses only transposition, which works for reorienting but fails entirely to match any expected patterns, producing scattered numbers instead of uniform blocks (e.g., Training 1 generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s/3s/4s/9s per row, vs. expected clean 7/3/0 bands with right-side consistency).
 * Train 1 mismatches by scattering original numbers (e.g., generated row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected all 7s except right 3s; unknown why transpose preserves some but jumbles others into non-blocks).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes and values (generated mixes 7s/8s/1s/3s/9s/5s/6s irregularly, e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,...] vs. expected [6,6,...,7,7]; doesn't form the vertical 6/3/8 bands).
 * Train 3 mismatches by introducing unrelated 1s/4s/5s/8s without banding (generated row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected [5,5,...,3,3,...]; row 3 has jagged 3/1/4/6/8 vs. expected 7/8/6/3/4 bands—unknown reason for value shifts).
 * Train 4 mismatches row repetitions and block edges (generated has varying 2/6/1/3 per row, e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,...] vs. expected all [6,6,...,2,2,2]; doesn't capture the alternating 6/3/2 bands).
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, missing core need to detect/ fill blobs (essential for future, as grids likely contain distinct shapes).
 * Transpose function is incorrect and not relevant (scrambles without insight; avoid in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears to be a direct (or near-direct) transpose of an unseen input grid, resulting in highly irregular rows with mixed numbers (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s; row 12 introduces 1s/0s scattered amid 9s/6s; later rows have 7s/4s/8s in non-uniform patterns like [9,9,7,7,...1,9,...]).
 * It lacks the uniform banding seen in all expected training outputs (e.g., no repeating identical rows or solid blocks of 6s/3s/9s/8s; instead, jagged edges and intrusions like single 1s or 0s disrupt potential regions, e.g., row 6 has [9,9,9,3,3,3,3,1,8,0,...] vs. what should likely be cleaner horizontal fills).
 * Doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it preserves input noise (scattered 0/1/2/3/8) without consolidation, suggesting no rule application—just mechanical swap; expected test should have structured bands (e.g., large 9/6 areas filled solidly, with transitions like training examples).
 * To handle test, future code must detect and expand dominant numbers per column/row, ignoring isolates; account for larger size (~30x30?) with varying blob densities.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected regions (blobs) of the same numerical value in a 2D grid, likely to simplify or reconstruct patterns such as filling bounding boxes or transforming shapes while preserving some structural rules, but the exact transformation rules (e.g., value mapping, region selection criteria, or output grid initialization) remain unclear from the failed attempts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are connected components of the same value, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via DFS or BFS, but only large regions (>=3 cells) are considered, ignoring noise/single cells or small groups.
 * The grid is transposed (rows become columns) before processing, which may be intended to rotate or reorient the puzzle for analysis, but this step appears to contribute to mismatches in orientation and positioning.
 * Regions are sorted by size (number of cells) in decreasing order, and their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) are filled with the region's value on a fresh zero-initialized grid; however, this overwrites smaller regions with larger ones, leading to loss of detail and incorrect value placements.
 * Expected outputs show clean, block-like patterns with specific values (e.g., large uniform areas of 7s, 3s, 0s in training 1; structured bands of 6s, 3s, 8s in training 2), suggesting the puzzle may involve value remapping, selective filling without full overwrites, or different connectivity (e.g., 8-connectivity including diagonals).
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must match exact positions and values without extraneous numbers (e.g., generated includes 1s, 4s, 9s where expected has 0s or 3s); zero areas in expectations indicate unfilled or background spaces; patterns suggest vertical/horizontal banding or shape extension, not just BBox filling.
 * Considerations across attempts: No rotation or mirroring beyond transpose; no handling of value-specific rules (e.g., some values like 0 or 1 might be treated as background); potential need to process original grid without transpose or combine multiple steps; small regions might actually be important in some cases despite the >=3 filter; overlapping BBoxes cause generated outputs to have irregular, non-blocky shapes unlike expectations.

                    regions[val].append(GridRegion(val, positions))

```
(This filling logic is somewhat helpful for reconstructing from BBoxes but is flawed as it overwrites without preserving original details or handling overlaps correctly; consider modifying to avoid full overwrites or use union of regions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed, indicating the core logic (transpose + extract large regions + size-ordered BBox fill on zero grid) does not capture the puzzle's transformation rules.
 * In training 1, generated a top-heavy grid with horizontal bands of 6s, 7s, 4s mixed with small 1s, 8s, 9s, but expected vertical bands of 7s transitioning to 3s and bottom 0s; the transpose likely rotated patterns incorrectly, and BBox filling created unwanted extensions (e.g., 6s where 7s expected), while ignoring small regions lost key separators.
 * In training 2, generated irregular shapes with 7s, 8s, 1s, 3s, 0s, 5s scattered (e.g., small 1s blobs and partial 8s bands), but expected clean horizontal bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, 9s with no small intrusions; size ordering overwrote smaller features like 1s incorrectly, and value mismatch (e.g., 7s instead of 6s) suggests no remapping.
 * In training 3, generated a jumbled mix of 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s, 8s, 5s, 9s with broken lines (e.g., interrupted 4s and 1s blobs), but expected structured rows of 5s/3s transitioning to 7/8/6/4 bands; BBox filling expanded regions too much (e.g., full rows of 6s where partial expected), and transpose misaligned vertical elements.
 * In training 4, generated overlapping 2s, 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s in non-block forms (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s and partial 6s), but expected repeating horizontal blocks of 6s, 3s, 2s; the approach captured some large blobs but failed to extend or clean them into uniform bands, with small 1s regions incorrectly preserved/included.
 * Transpose_grid is helpful but likely unnecessary or wrongly applied, as it consistently rotates patterns away from expected orientations.
 * extract_regions is essential and mostly correct for blob detection but misses subtleties like including smaller regions (<3 cells) or using 8-connectivity; the >=3 filter discards potentially important small features (e.g., 1s in trainings).
 * fill_large_regions is broken/not helpful as-is, because size-ordered overwriting creates artifacts (e.g., large BBoxes erase smaller ones entirely, leading to uniform blocks where mixed or zero areas expected); don't use without modifications like layering or selective filling.
 * Overall, no value remapping or background handling (e.g., propagating 0s), and no consideration for puzzle-specific rules like extending shapes to grid edges or ignoring certain values.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears chaotic/incoherent compared to the structured, blocky expectations from trainings; it has massive horizontal bands of 9s at top/bottom, vertical columns of 6s on the right, irregular intrusions of 3s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 7s, 8s scattered in the middle (e.g., small 1s/2s blobs amid 0s, partial 4s bands overwritten by 8s), creating a non-patterned mess rather than clean regions.
 * It over-relies on BBox filling, expanding large 9s and 6s to dominate while leaving noisy small regions (e.g., isolated 1s/2s where zeros or unified blocks might be expected), and the transpose likely misorients the input's vertical/horizontal features.
 * The output mismatches potential expected clean divisions (e.g., no full zero backgrounds or value shifts like 3-to-0 transitions seen in training 1), with unknown reasons for specific value appearances (e.g., why 4s and 7s emerge); it does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it lacks the banded, uniform structure of expectations—likely needs rules for non-overwriting fills, value substitution, or no transpose to handle the test case's wider grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:09:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving identifying connected regions (blobs) of the same numerical value in a 2D grid, likely representing colors or shapes, and then transforming the grid by expanding or filling these regions in a specific way to create larger uniform blocks or patterns, followed by a possible transposition of the grid. The goal appears to be reconstructing a "completed" or stylized version of the input where dominant regions are emphasized or extended, while smaller or isolated elements are handled differently, resulting in clean, blocky outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), as implemented in the DFS, which seems correct for blob extraction but may miss nuances if regions have holes or irregular shapes.
 * Only "large" regions are processed (current code uses >=3 cells), but this threshold might be too low or incorrect—expected outputs suggest focusing on the largest or most prominent blobs per value, potentially ignoring small ones entirely (e.g., single cells or pairs), and possibly merging or extending them to form rectangular or strip-like blocks that align with grid edges.
 * Bounding box filling overfills areas, overwriting non-connected cells and causing overlaps (e.g., in training 1, it creates unwanted 6-filled rows and mixes 7s with 1s/4s/9s, instead of clean 7/3/0 strips); the puzzle likely requires filling only the minimal enclosing shape or expanding in specific directions (e.g., vertically/horizontally to edges) without overwriting other regions.
 * Sorting regions by size descending and filling largest first is a good idea for prioritization but fails due to bbox overreach; subtleties include handling overlapping bboxes (current code doesn't resolve conflicts) and preserving small regions or backgrounds (e.g., 0s in expected outputs).
 * Transposition (zip(*grid)) is applied at the end, which may be key for some orientations (e.g., turning row-based patterns into column-based), but in the examples, it leads to mismatches—perhaps it should be conditional or applied before/after filling.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16 in train 1, 10x10 in train 2, 9x14 in train 3, 10x10 in train 4, larger irregular in test), so code must handle dynamic dimensions; inputs may have sparse or irregular distributions, with values like 0 as background.
 * Expected outputs show clean, uniform horizontal/vertical bands or quadrants (e.g., train 1 has stacked rows of 7s, 3s, 0s; train 2 has mixed but blocky patterns; train 4 emphasizes 6s and 3s in blocks), suggesting the transformation "simplifies" the grid by promoting dominant colors to full rows/columns while demoting others.
 * Subtle elements: Possible color-specific rules (e.g., highest value dominates?); handling of isolated cells (e.g., 1s in train 1 expected as part of 3s or omitted); no diagonal connectivity; potential for regions to "grow" towards edges but not beyond other blobs; test input has many small scattered elements (1s, 2s, 4s, 7s), which may need ignoring or minimal filling.
 * All examples are transposed in output, but inputs aren't shown—assume input is pre-transposed or needs it to match orientation.
 * Avoid filling entire bboxes if regions aren't rectangular; perhaps compute filled rectangles only if the region spans fully in one dimension.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import defaultdict

class GridRegion:
    def __init__(self, value: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]):
        self.value = value
        self.positions = positions
        self.bbox = self._compute_bbox()

    def _compute_bbox(self) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
        if not self.positions:
            return 0, 0, 0, 0
        rows = [p[0] for p in self.positions]
        cols = [p[1] for p in self.positions]
        return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(This class is helpful for representing regions and computing bounding boxes, which is essential for any expansion logic; keep it but modify filling to avoid overreach.)

```python
def extract_regions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[GridRegion]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return {}
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    regions = defaultdict(list)

    def dfs(r: int, c: int, val: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]):
        stack = [(r, c)]
        while stack:
            cr, cc = stack.pop()
            if 0 <= cr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols and not visited[cr][cc] and g[cr][cc] == val:
                visited[cr][cc] = True
                positions.append((cr, cc))
                stack.append((cr - 1, cc))
                stack.append((cr + 1, cc))
                stack.append((cr, cc - 1))
                stack.append((cr, cc + 1))

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c]:
                val = g[r][c]
                positions = []
                dfs(r, c, val, positions)
                if len(positions) >= 3:  # Threshold may need adjustment, e.g., >=4 or per-value max
                    regions[val].append(GridRegion(val, positions))
    return regions
```
(This function correctly extracts 4-connected regions and filters small ones; it's essential and mostly working, but adjust threshold/filter to keep only the largest per value, and ensure it doesn't skip backgrounds like 0s if needed.)

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This is helpful for final orientation adjustment, as all expected outputs appear transposed; keep but verify if it should be applied to input first.)

```python
def fill_large_regions(g: List[List[int]], regions: Dict[int, List[GridRegion]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    all_regions = []
    for val, reg_list in regions.items():
        all_regions.extend(reg_list)
    all_regions.sort(key=lambda rg: len(rg.positions), reverse=True)
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    output = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    for region in all_regions:
        min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = region.bbox
        for rr in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
            for cc in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
                if 0 <= rr < h and 0 <= cc < w:
                    output[rr][cc] = region.value
    return output
```
(This function is broken/not helpful as-is because full bbox filling causes overlaps and incorrect expansions (e.g., turns irregular blobs into rectangles that overwrite everything); don't use in future—replace with targeted filling, e.g., only fill positions within the region or extend to edges without overwriting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed, with generated outputs showing overfilled bounding boxes that create unwanted uniform strips or mixed regions (e.g., train 1 generated top-heavy 6s/7s with scattered 1s/4s/9s/8s, differing from expected stacked 7/3/0 bands; train 2 generated irregular 7/8/1/3/0/5 blocks, missing expected 6/3/8/7/9 structure; train 3 generated fragmented 6/1/4/3/8/5/9, unlike expected clean 5/3/7/8/6/4 rows; train 4 generated scattered 2/6/1/4/3, not matching expected 6/3/2 blocks).
 * Connected component extraction via DFS worked for identifying blobs (e.g., correctly groups same-value cells), but filtering >=3 cells may include too many small regions, leading to noise.
 * Sorting by size and filling largest first is a partial win for prioritizing dominant blobs but fails due to bbox overfill, which ignores region shape and causes cascading overwrites (e.g., large 9s in test overwrite everything into messy patterns).
 * Transposition is applied but mismatches orientations—e.g., in train 1, it produces horizontal strips that don't align with expected vertical-ish bands (unknown if input needs pre-transpose).
 * No handling for color dominance or background preservation (e.g., 0s in train 1 expected at bottom, but generated as partial fills); small elements like isolated 1s are incorrectly incorporated.
 * extract_regions is essential and mostly correct (keep/modify threshold); GridRegion class is useful for bbox but needs better filling logic.
 * fill_large_regions is incorrect and not relevant (overfills; avoid in future).
 * Missed subtlety of expanding to grid edges without overlaps (e.g., train 4 expected 6s/3s/2s as full blocks, but generated keeps small 1s/4s).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob merging for unknown reason (e.g., 1s and 3s not combined into expected 8/6/9 areas).
 * Train 3 has bbox filling that fragments middle rows (1s/4s mixed), differing from expected unified 3/6/4 bands.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a chaotic overfill of 9s dominating edges and large areas, with scattered small blobs of 3/0/1/2/8/6/4/7 not forming clean blocks, unlike the uniform band/quadrant patterns in expected trainings (e.g., excessive 9s fill almost entire rows/columns, overwriting potential structures like the small 1s/2s/4s/7s into irregular patches; 6s form a vertical strip but are interrupted, and 8s/4s create mismatched bottom blocks).
 * It fails to simplify into large uniform regions (e.g., no clear stacking like train 1's 7/3/0), instead amplifying bbox errors on the large input (30 cols, ~30 rows?) with many small scattered elements, resulting in a "smeared" grid rather than a stylized completion.
 * Likely incorrect because it doesn't demote small regions (e.g., isolated 1s/2s should be absorbed or omitted, not bbox-filled into lines); to handle test, need rules for ignoring < certain size, resolving overlaps by priority (e.g., value-based), and possibly row/column-wise dominance.

[2025-10-02 08:09:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs represented as 2D lists of integers (likely pixel-like values for colors or shapes), where the goal is to transform the input into an output grid that simplifies or reinterprets the visual patterns into large uniform blocks or regions, possibly by identifying and filling connected components, propagating boundaries, or applying symmetry/rotation rules to create stylized, blocky representations. The outputs emphasize horizontal or vertical stripes of consistent values, suggesting rules around region expansion, omission of noise, or mirroring that preserve overall structure but simplify details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently feature large, uniform blocks or stripes of the same number (e.g., rows or sections filled with 7s, 3s, 0s), indicating a need to detect and expand connected regions rather than preserving exact pixel values—subtle noise or small variations in input are likely ignored or filled over.
 * Patterns suggest possible rotation, mirroring, or axis-based propagation (e.g., vertical lines becoming horizontal blocks), but not simple transpose, as outputs maintain aspect ratios and block orientations that align with input visuals rather than just swapping rows/columns.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: small isolated values (e.g., 1s or outliers) are often omitted or absorbed into surrounding blocks, while key structural elements (e.g., dividers or blobs) are preserved and expanded—easy to miss that boundaries might "bleed" or fill adjacent areas.
 * Consider grid dimensions: inputs vary (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), but outputs match input size, so transformations must be in-place or reshaping without dimension change; subtle padding or edge effects may occur in non-square grids.
 * Across examples, dominant values (e.g., 6,7,8) form the bulk of blocks, while minor ones (e.g., 1,0) appear in specific positions like corners or transitions—rules likely prioritize majority regions and suppress minorities unless they form distinct objects.
 * Potential for object extraction: inputs may contain "objects" like shapes or blobs (connected same-value cells), which need to be identified, then redrawn in output with filled interiors or outlines; missing this leads to pixel-level copies instead of abstracted blocks.
 * Symmetry and repetition: many expected outputs repeat rows (e.g., 4 identical rows of 7s), hinting at vertical mirroring or replication of horizontal slices—subtle that this isn't uniform across the grid but segmented by value changes.
 * Noise handling: generated outputs retain scattered small values (e.g., isolated 1s, 0s), but expected clean them up into blocks, so rules must include thresholding or flood-filling.
 * All training examples failed, emphasizing that low-level operations like transpose ignore high-level visual semantics.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used only transposition (zip(*g)), which swapped rows and columns but failed to abstract or fill regions, resulting in jumbled, non-blocky outputs that preserved exact values without simplification—e.g., in Training 1, generated scattered 6s/7s/8s with outliers like 1s/0s, while expected clean horizontal blocks of 7s (top 4 rows), 3s (next 4), and 0s (bottom 4) with precise right-side transitions.
 * Training 1: Generated had vertical stripes of 6s/7s/4s mixed with noise (e.g., row 0: [6]*10 + [7,7,7,8,8,8]), differing from expected uniform rows (e.g., first 4 rows all [7]*10 + [3,3,3,7,7,7]); unknown why transpose produced those specific values, but it mismatched block uniformity and omitted 0-block expansion.
 * Training 2: Generated messy 10x10 with scattered 7s/8s/3s/1s (e.g., row 0: [7,7,7,8]*3), vs. expected top 3 rows of [6]*8 + [7,7], then 5 rows of [3,3,3,8,8,6]*3 + [7,7], and bottom 2 of [3]*3 + [8,8,9,9,9,7,7]; transpose failed to create the repeating 6/8 blocks and introduced irrelevant 1s/5s/9s.
 * Training 3: Generated irregular 9x14 with mixed 6s/5s/3s/4s/1s/8s (e.g., row 0: [6]*9 + [5,9,9,9,5]), vs. expected top 3 rows [5]*5 + [3]*9, then 3 rows [7,8]*3 + [6,3]*3 + [6]*3 + [4]*3, and bottom 3 [7,8]*3 + [6]*7 + [4]*3; differences include failure to group 5s/3s into left blocks and expand 6/4 rights, with generated retaining small 1s/9s as noise.
 * Training 4: Generated 10x10 with scattered 2s/6s/1s/3s/4s (e.g., row 0: [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]), vs. expected top 3 and bottom 3 rows [6]*7 + [2]*3, middle 4 [3]*7 + [2]*3; transpose scrambled into non-uniform rows, missing the alternating 6/3 block pattern and filling outliers like 1s into blocks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs to fill—transpose is broken for this puzzle as it doesn't handle connectivity or abstraction (don't use it in future).
 * All attempts (just one) missed core simplification to blocks, leading to 100% incorrect results; subtle repetition in expected (e.g., identical rows) was ignored.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (30x30? irregular lines suggest non-square, but jumbled with 30 elements per row) does not look correct, as it retains high noise and fragmentation (e.g., row 0: [9]*14 + [6]*14 + [9]*2, but mixes in scattered 3s/0s/1s/8s/2s across rows, creating no clear blocks—in row 12: introduces unrelated [0,1,1,1,6,6,9]* etc., which seems like transposed artifacts).
 * It fails to produce expected blocky structure, likely uniform 9/6/3/0/2/8 regions based on patterns from training (e.g., large top 9-blocks, mid 6/0 stripes, bottom 4/8 fills), instead showing irregular spreads (e.g., 2s clustering mid-right but not expanded, 1s as noise); this doesn't make sense visually, as it looks like raw transpose without filling, missing the puzzle's abstraction to clean, repeating stripes.
 * To handle test, must account for larger/more complex inputs with multiple nested regions (e.g., inner 0/1/2 clusters within 3/9 areas), requiring robust region extraction and expansion rules not present in the attempt.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored regions or shapes) are processed into output grids that appear to simplify, fill, or reorganize patterns into larger uniform blocks or structured regions, possibly by identifying connected components, propagating values, or applying symmetry/rotation rules. The goal is to match the exact expected outputs, which often feature repeating rows of consistent numbers forming bands or blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs often create horizontal bands of identical numbers across rows, suggesting a rule for filling or averaging regions vertically/horizontally, but with precise boundaries that preserve some original structure (e.g., in Training 1, top 4 rows are all 7s with a 3-column exception on the right; bottom has 0s transitioning to 3s).
 * Subtle element: Outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate scattered numbers into solid blocks (e.g., in Training 1 expected, 7s dominate upper half, 3s in middle, 0s at bottom with right-side 7s; generated has irregular 6s, 1s, 4s, 9s scattered, ignoring block formation).
 * Connected regions or "blobs" of the same number seem key, but not simple flood-filling—outputs expand or select dominant values per row/column while preserving some irregularities (e.g., Training 2 expected has repeating 6s on left, 3s with 8s/9s on right; generated mixes 7s, 1s, 3s randomly).
 * Dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1 is 12x16, Training 2 is 10x10, Training 3 9x14, Training 4 10x10), so code must handle arbitrary sizes without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Possible rotation or mirroring: Outputs don't match simple transposes, but some vertical alignment suggests row-wise processing or vertical propagation (e.g., Training 4 expected repeats 6s and 3s in blocks; generated has jagged 2s, 1s, 3s).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs aren't just copies or mirrors—some numbers change (e.g., Training 3 generated has 1s/4s where expected has 5s/3s/7s/8s/6s in clean bands), implying selection of min/max or mode per region.
 * All training examples show outputs with high repetition per row, hinting at smoothing or consensus rules across columns.
 * No evidence of object extraction yet, but grids may represent scenes with "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need isolation or transformation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs; do not use in future attempts as it ignores block formation.)

No other functions from attempts; no object extraction or blob detection implemented yet, which may be needed for identifying regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses only transposition, which works for reorienting but fails entirely to match any expected patterns, producing scattered numbers instead of uniform blocks (e.g., Training 1 generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s/3s/4s/9s per row, vs. expected clean 7/3/0 bands with right-side consistency).
 * Train 1 mismatches by scattering original numbers (e.g., generated row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected all 7s except right 3s; unknown why transpose preserves some but jumbles others into non-blocks).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes and values (generated mixes 7s/8s/1s/3s/9s/5s/6s irregularly, e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,...] vs. expected [6,6,...,7,7]; doesn't form the vertical 6/3/8 bands).
 * Train 3 mismatches by introducing unrelated 1s/4s/5s/8s without banding (generated row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected [5,5,...,3,3,...]; row 3 has jagged 3/1/4/6/8 vs. expected 7/8/6/3/4 bands—unknown reason for value shifts).
 * Train 4 mismatches row repetitions and block edges (generated has varying 2/6/1/3 per row, e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,...] vs. expected all [6,6,...,2,2,2]; doesn't capture the alternating 6/3/2 bands).
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, missing core need to detect/ fill blobs (essential for future, as grids likely contain distinct shapes).
 * Transpose function is incorrect and not relevant (scrambles without insight; avoid in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears to be a direct (or near-direct) transpose of an unseen input grid, resulting in highly irregular rows with mixed numbers (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s; row 12 introduces 1s/0s scattered amid 9s/6s; later rows have 7s/4s/8s in non-uniform patterns like [9,9,7,7,...1,9,...]).
 * It lacks the uniform banding seen in all expected training outputs (e.g., no repeating identical rows or solid blocks of 6s/3s/9s/8s; instead, jagged edges and intrusions like single 1s or 0s disrupt potential regions, e.g., row 6 has [9,9,9,3,3,3,3,1,8,0,...] vs. what should likely be cleaner horizontal fills).
 * Doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it preserves input noise (scattered 0/1/2/3/8) without consolidation, suggesting no rule application—just mechanical swap; expected test should have structured bands (e.g., large 9/6 areas filled solidly, with transitions like training examples).
 * To handle test, future code must detect and expand dominant numbers per column/row, ignoring isolates; account for larger size (~30x30?) with varying blob densities.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected regions (blobs) of the same numerical value in a 2D grid, likely to simplify or reconstruct patterns such as filling bounding boxes or transforming shapes while preserving some structural rules, but the exact transformation rules (e.g., value mapping, region selection criteria, or output grid initialization) remain unclear from the failed attempts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are connected components of the same value, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via DFS or BFS, but only large regions (>=3 cells) are considered, ignoring noise/single cells or small groups.
 * The grid is transposed (rows become columns) before processing, which may be intended to rotate or reorient the puzzle for analysis, but this step appears to contribute to mismatches in orientation and positioning.
 * Regions are sorted by size (number of cells) in decreasing order, and their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) are filled with the region's value on a fresh zero-initialized grid; however, this overwrites smaller regions with larger ones, leading to loss of detail and incorrect value placements.
 * Expected outputs show clean, block-like patterns with specific values (e.g., large uniform areas of 7s, 3s, 0s in training 1; structured bands of 6s, 3s, 8s in training 2), suggesting the puzzle may involve value remapping, selective filling without full overwrites, or different connectivity (e.g., 8-connectivity including diagonals).
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must match exact positions and values without extraneous numbers (e.g., generated includes 1s, 4s, 9s where expected has 0s or 3s); zero areas in expectations indicate unfilled or background spaces; patterns suggest vertical/horizontal banding or shape extension, not just BBox filling.
 * Considerations across attempts: No rotation or mirroring beyond transpose; no handling of value-specific rules (e.g., some values like 0 or 1 might be treated as background); potential need to process original grid without transpose or combine multiple steps; small regions might actually be important in some cases despite the >=3 filter; overlapping BBoxes cause generated outputs to have irregular, non-blocky shapes unlike expectations.

    return output
```
(This filling logic is somewhat helpful for reconstructing from BBoxes but is flawed as it overwrites without preserving original details or handling overlaps correctly; consider modifying to avoid full overwrites or use union of regions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed, indicating the core logic (transpose + extract large regions + size-ordered BBox fill on zero grid) does not capture the puzzle's transformation rules.
 * In training 1, generated a top-heavy grid with horizontal bands of 6s, 7s, 4s mixed with small 1s, 8s, 9s, but expected vertical bands of 7s transitioning to 3s and bottom 0s; the transpose likely rotated patterns incorrectly, and BBox filling created unwanted extensions (e.g., 6s where 7s expected), while ignoring small regions lost key separators.
 * In training 2, generated irregular shapes with 7s, 8s, 1s, 3s, 0s, 5s scattered (e.g., small 1s blobs and partial 8s bands), but expected clean horizontal bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, 9s with no small intrusions; size ordering overwrote smaller features like 1s incorrectly, and value mismatch (e.g., 7s instead of 6s) suggests no remapping.
 * In training 3, generated a jumbled mix of 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s, 8s, 5s, 9s with broken lines (e.g., interrupted 4s and 1s blobs), but expected structured rows of 5s/3s transitioning to 7/8/6/4 bands; BBox filling expanded regions too much (e.g., full rows of 6s where partial expected), and transpose misaligned vertical elements.
 * In training 4, generated overlapping 2s, 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s in non-block forms (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s and partial 6s), but expected repeating horizontal blocks of 6s, 3s, 2s; the approach captured some large blobs but failed to extend or clean them into uniform bands, with small 1s regions incorrectly preserved/included.
 * Transpose_grid is helpful but likely unnecessary or wrongly applied, as it consistently rotates patterns away from expected orientations.
 * extract_regions is essential and mostly correct for blob detection but misses subtleties like including smaller regions (<3 cells) or using 8-connectivity; the >=3 filter discards potentially important small features (e.g., 1s in trainings).
 * fill_large_regions is broken/not helpful as-is, because size-ordered overwriting creates artifacts (e.g., large BBoxes erase smaller ones entirely, leading to uniform blocks where mixed or zero areas expected); don't use without modifications like layering or selective filling.
 * Overall, no value remapping or background handling (e.g., propagating 0s), and no consideration for puzzle-specific rules like extending shapes to grid edges or ignoring certain values.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears chaotic/incoherent compared to the structured, blocky expectations from trainings; it has massive horizontal bands of 9s at top/bottom, vertical columns of 6s on the right, irregular intrusions of 3s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 7s, 8s scattered in the middle (e.g., small 1s/2s blobs amid 0s, partial 4s bands overwritten by 8s), creating a non-patterned mess rather than clean regions.
 * It over-relies on BBox filling, expanding large 9s and 6s to dominate while leaving noisy small regions (e.g., isolated 1s/2s where zeros or unified blocks might be expected), and the transpose likely misorients the input's vertical/horizontal features.
 * The output mismatches potential expected clean divisions (e.g., no full zero backgrounds or value shifts like 3-to-0 transitions seen in training 1), with unknown reasons for specific value appearances (e.g., why 4s and 7s emerge); it does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it lacks the banded, uniform structure of expectations—likely needs rules for non-overwriting fills, value substitution, or no transpose to handle the test case's wider grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving identifying connected regions (blobs) of the same numerical value in a 2D grid, likely representing colors or shapes, and then transforming the grid by expanding or filling these regions in a specific way to create larger uniform blocks or patterns, followed by a possible transposition of the grid. The goal appears to be reconstructing a "completed" or stylized version of the input where dominant regions are emphasized or extended, while smaller or isolated elements are handled differently, resulting in clean, blocky outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), as implemented in the DFS, which seems correct for blob extraction but may miss nuances if regions have holes or irregular shapes.
 * Only "large" regions are processed (current code uses >=3 cells), but this threshold might be too low or incorrect—expected outputs suggest focusing on the largest or most prominent blobs per value, potentially ignoring small ones entirely (e.g., single cells or pairs), and possibly merging or extending them to form rectangular or strip-like blocks that align with grid edges.
 * Bounding box filling overfills areas, overwriting non-connected cells and causing overlaps (e.g., in training 1, it creates unwanted 6-filled rows and mixes 7s with 1s/4s/9s, instead of clean 7/3/0 strips); the puzzle likely requires filling only the minimal enclosing shape or expanding in specific directions (e.g., vertically/horizontally to edges) without overwriting other regions.
 * Sorting regions by size descending and filling largest first is a good idea for prioritization but fails due to bbox overreach; subtleties include handling overlapping bboxes (current code doesn't resolve conflicts) and preserving small regions or backgrounds (e.g., 0s in expected outputs).
 * Transposition (zip(*grid)) is applied at the end, which may be key for some orientations (e.g., turning row-based patterns into column-based), but in the examples, it leads to mismatches—perhaps it should be conditional or applied before/after filling.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16 in train 1, 10x10 in train 2, 9x14 in train 3, 10x10 in train 4, larger irregular in test), so code must handle dynamic dimensions; inputs may have sparse or irregular distributions, with values like 0 as background.
 * Expected outputs show clean, uniform horizontal/vertical bands or quadrants (e.g., train 1 has stacked rows of 7s, 3s, 0s; train 2 has mixed but blocky patterns; train 4 emphasizes 6s and 3s in blocks), suggesting the transformation "simplifies" the grid by promoting dominant colors to full rows/columns while demoting others.
 * Subtle elements: Possible color-specific rules (e.g., highest value dominates?); handling of isolated cells (e.g., 1s in train 1 expected as part of 3s or omitted); no diagonal connectivity; potential for regions to "grow" towards edges but not beyond other blobs; test input has many small scattered elements (1s, 2s, 4s, 7s), which may need ignoring or minimal filling.
 * All examples are transposed in output, but inputs aren't shown—assume input is pre-transposed or needs it to match orientation.
 * Avoid filling entire bboxes if regions aren't rectangular; perhaps compute filled rectangles only if the region spans fully in one dimension.

                stack.append((cr + 1, cc))

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c]:
                val = g[r][c]
                positions = []
                dfs(r, c, val, positions)
                if len(positions) >= 3:  # Threshold may need adjustment, e.g., >=4 or per-value max
                    regions[val].append(GridRegion(val, positions))
    return regions
```
(This function correctly extracts 4-connected regions and filters small ones; it's essential and mostly working, but adjust threshold/filter to keep only the largest per value, and ensure it doesn't skip backgrounds like 0s if needed.)

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This is helpful for final orientation adjustment, as all expected outputs appear transposed; keep but verify if it should be applied to input first.)

```python
def fill_large_regions(g: List[List[int]], regions: Dict[int, List[GridRegion]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    all_regions = []
    for val, reg_list in regions.items():
        all_regions.extend(reg_list)
    all_regions.sort(key=lambda rg: len(rg.positions), reverse=True)
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    output = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]
    for region in all_regions:
        min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = region.bbox
        for rr in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
            for cc in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
                if 0 <= rr < h and 0 <= cc < w:
                    output[rr][cc] = region.value
    return output
```
(This function is broken/not helpful as-is because full bbox filling causes overlaps and incorrect expansions (e.g., turns irregular blobs into rectangles that overwrite everything); don't use in future—replace with targeted filling, e.g., only fill positions within the region or extend to edges without overwriting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed, with generated outputs showing overfilled bounding boxes that create unwanted uniform strips or mixed regions (e.g., train 1 generated top-heavy 6s/7s with scattered 1s/4s/9s/8s, differing from expected stacked 7/3/0 bands; train 2 generated irregular 7/8/1/3/0/5 blocks, missing expected 6/3/8/7/9 structure; train 3 generated fragmented 6/1/4/3/8/5/9, unlike expected clean 5/3/7/8/6/4 rows; train 4 generated scattered 2/6/1/4/3, not matching expected 6/3/2 blocks).
 * Connected component extraction via DFS worked for identifying blobs (e.g., correctly groups same-value cells), but filtering >=3 cells may include too many small regions, leading to noise.
 * Sorting by size and filling largest first is a partial win for prioritizing dominant blobs but fails due to bbox overfill, which ignores region shape and causes cascading overwrites (e.g., large 9s in test overwrite everything into messy patterns).
 * Transposition is applied but mismatches orientations—e.g., in train 1, it produces horizontal strips that don't align with expected vertical-ish bands (unknown if input needs pre-transpose).
 * No handling for color dominance or background preservation (e.g., 0s in train 1 expected at bottom, but generated as partial fills); small elements like isolated 1s are incorrectly incorporated.
 * extract_regions is essential and mostly correct (keep/modify threshold); GridRegion class is useful for bbox but needs better filling logic.
 * fill_large_regions is incorrect and not relevant (overfills; avoid in future).
 * Missed subtlety of expanding to grid edges without overlaps (e.g., train 4 expected 6s/3s/2s as full blocks, but generated keeps small 1s/4s).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob merging for unknown reason (e.g., 1s and 3s not combined into expected 8/6/9 areas).
 * Train 3 has bbox filling that fragments middle rows (1s/4s mixed), differing from expected unified 3/6/4 bands.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a chaotic overfill of 9s dominating edges and large areas, with scattered small blobs of 3/0/1/2/8/6/4/7 not forming clean blocks, unlike the uniform band/quadrant patterns in expected trainings (e.g., excessive 9s fill almost entire rows/columns, overwriting potential structures like the small 1s/2s/4s/7s into irregular patches; 6s form a vertical strip but are interrupted, and 8s/4s create mismatched bottom blocks).
 * It fails to simplify into large uniform regions (e.g., no clear stacking like train 1's 7/3/0), instead amplifying bbox errors on the large input (30 cols, ~30 rows?) with many small scattered elements, resulting in a "smeared" grid rather than a stylized completion.
 * Likely incorrect because it doesn't demote small regions (e.g., isolated 1s/2s should be absorbed or omitted, not bbox-filled into lines); to handle test, need rules for ignoring < certain size, resolving overlaps by priority (e.g., value-based), and possibly row/column-wise dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:26:48] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based "blobs" or connected regions of identical numbers (likely representing colored or labeled areas), where the task is to identify these regions, expand or fill them into rectangular bounding boxes without overwriting in unintended ways, and then transform the grid (possibly via transpose or rotation) to match a reorganized output pattern. The input grids contain numbers like 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (possibly with 1 as background or separator), and the output rearranges these into solid blocks or expanded shapes that align with expected patterns, often shifting or reorienting regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are connected components of the same number, but connectivity matters: the current 8-directional DFS captures diagonal connections, which may over-merge regions (e.g., in Training 1, this likely caused 6's and 7's to blob together incorrectly instead of separating into distinct horizontal/vertical bands).
 * Background or empty cells: The code skips cells with value 1, treating it as non-region, but expected outputs include 0's as filled areas (e.g., Training 1 has 0's in a band), suggesting 0 might be a valid region value or a default fill, while 1 could be ignored or treated differently; do not assume 1 is the only skip—test for 0 as a fillable region.
 * Filling mechanism: Regions are expanded to axis-aligned bounding boxes (bbox), but sorting by size descending and overwriting smaller bboxes with larger ones leads to loss of detail (e.g., in Training 1, smaller 3's and 0's are overwritten by 7's; in Training 2, 3's and 8's bleed into each other).
 * Overlaps and order: Larger regions should not completely overwrite smaller ones; perhaps fill without overwriting (e.g., only fill unvisited cells) or process in a different order (e.g., by value or position). Subtle: bbox filling ignores the original shape, turning irregular blobs into rectangles, which works for some straight bands but fails for L-shapes or protrusions (e.g., Training 3 has irregular 3's and 6's that expected output straightens differently).
 * Grid transformation: Transposing (zip(*grid)) at the end rotates the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise, but expected outputs suggest a different reorientation—possibly mirroring, rotating 180, or no transpose, as patterns in Training 1/4 shift vertically/horizontally rather than purely transposing (e.g., Training 4 expected has vertical 6's becoming horizontal, but generated keeps some vertical artifacts).
 * Region validation: Only regions with len(positions) >=1 are kept, but single cells might need special handling; also, 0 might represent "empty" that gets filled by adjacent regions or left as-is.
 * Edge cases: Grids vary in size (e.g., Training 1 is 12x16, Training 2 is 10x10), so ensure bbox clipping to grid bounds; disconnected same-value regions are treated separately (good), but merging across diagonals is a subtlety to avoid.
 * Overall goal: Outputs show "solidified" blocks where original scattered same-value cells form uniform rectangles, often with bands stacking in a new orientation, suggesting the puzzle is about "rectangularizing" and reordering regions by size, value, or position.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class GridRegion:
    def __init__(self, value: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]):
        self.value = value
        self.positions = positions
        self.bbox = self._compute_bbox()

    def _compute_bbox(self) -> Tuple[int, int, int, int]:
        if not self.positions:
            return 0, 0, 0, 0
        rows = [p[0] for p in self.positions]
        cols = [p[1] for p in self.positions]
        return min(rows), max(rows), min(cols), max(cols)
```
(This class is useful for representing regions and computing bboxes cleanly; retain for future use to track shapes without recomputing.)

```python
def extract_regions(g: List[List[int]]) -> Dict[int, List[GridRegion]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return {}
    rows, cols = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    regions = defaultdict(list)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]  # Currently 8-dir; consider changing to 4-dir: [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]

    def dfs(r: int, c: int, val: int, positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]):
        stack = [(r, c)]
        while stack:
            cr, cc = stack.pop()
            if 0 <= cr < rows and 0 <= cc < cols and not visited[cr][cc] and g[cr][cc] == val:
                visited[cr][cc] = True
                positions.append((cr, cc))
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    stack.append((cr + dr, cc + dc))

    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if not visited[r][c] and g[r][c] != 1:  # Skips 1; may need to include 0 or adjust
                val = g[r][c]
                positions = []
                dfs(r, c, val, positions)
                if len(positions) >= 1:
                    regions[val].append(GridRegion(val, positions))
    return regions
```
(This is helpful for extracting connected components but broken for this puzzle due to 8-connectivity over-merging and skipping only 1; modify directions to 4-connected and handle 0 as a region to fix.)

```python
def fill_regions(g: List[List[int]], regions: Dict[int, List[GridRegion]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    all_regions = []
    for val, reg_list in regions.items():
        all_regions.extend(reg_list)
    all_regions.sort(key=lambda rg: len(rg.positions), reverse=True)  # Largest first; may need different sort (e.g., by value or position)
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0]) if g else 0
    output = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]  # Initializes to 0; good if 0 is background fill
    for region in all_regions:
        min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = region.bbox
        for rr in range(max(0, min_r), min(h, max_r + 1)):
            for cc in range(max(0, min_c), min(w, max_c + 1)):
                output[rr][cc] = region.value  # Overwrites everything in bbox; change to only unvisited/original positions to avoid bleed
    return output
```
(This is partially helpful for bbox expansion but unhelpful in current form due to aggressive overwriting; modify to fill only region positions or non-overlapping areas.)

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This is helpful as a transformation tool but likely incorrect for the puzzle—expected outputs suggest no transpose or a different rotation/mirror; test without it or use 180-degree rotate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single program attempt used 8-connected DFS, which over-merged diagonally adjacent cells (e.g., in Training 1, caused 6's to expand into areas that should be 7's or 0's, generating mismatched horizontal bands of 6/7 instead of vertical 7/3/0 stacks).
 * Sorting regions by size descending and filling bboxes led to larger regions (e.g., 7's in Training 1) overwriting smaller ones (3's and 0's), resulting in loss of distinct bands; expected outputs preserve separate rectangular blocks without bleed.
 * Skipping only value==1 in extraction ignored potential 0 regions, leading to unfilled areas (e.g., Training 1 generated has stray 0's where expected has solid 0 bands).
 * Transpose at the end rotated patterns incorrectly: Training 1 generated has horizontal 6/7 rows that don't match expected vertical stacks; Training 4 generated keeps some vertical 2/6 but scrambles them, while expected reorients to horizontal 6/2 with vertical 3's.
 * In Training 2, over-merging created irregular 7/8/3 shapes (e.g., generated has 7's intruding into 3's), differing from expected clean horizontal bands of 6/3/8/9/7; unknown why 0 and 5/9 got misplaced, but likely bbox overwrite.
 * Training 3: 8-connectivity merged 3's and 6's diagonally, generating scattered 4/6/8 with 5/9 intrusions, vs. expected solid top 5/3 bands and vertical 7/8/6/4; bbox filling ignored original protrusions (e.g., single 7's not expanded properly).
 * Training 4: Simple bands were partially captured (e.g., some 6/2/3 rectangles), but transpose and overwrite scrambled order—generated has vertical 3's at bottom but misplaced 0/2, vs. expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; closer but still mismatched orientation.
 * Overall, extract_regions is essential for blob detection but needs 4-connectivity fix; fill_regions is broken due to overwrite (don't use as-is); transpose is not relevant or wrong for reorientation (test alternatives like no transform).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flaws as training: excessive overwriting (e.g., 9's dominate left/right columns, bleeding into 3/6/0/2/8/4 areas, creating solid 9 walls where expected likely has distinct bands); 8-connectivity likely merged large 9/6/8 blobs diagonally, ignoring separations (e.g., row 13 has stray 0 in 9's, suggesting partial non-overwrite but inconsistent). It has irregular shapes like a single 8 in row 7 and scattered 2's/4's/7's at bottom, vs. what should be clean rectangular blocks (e.g., vertical 3's on left, horizontal 6's in middle, bottom 4/8 bands)—patterns don't align into expected stacked rectangles, and transpose likely misorients the large 9 regions. Missing solid fills for 0 (appears as holes) and 2/7/4 (scattered vs. banded); does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it looks noisy/overmerged rather than organized.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:27:10] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input-output pairs (1-4), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both inputs and outputs where applicable). I focused on properties like position, color, shape (inferred from bbox, pixels, and holes), and overlaps/adjacencies that show clear, repeated relationships. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is implied. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., single-pixel outliers with no relational ties) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., Orange circular forms, which appear in only 2/4 inputs and transform variably without repeatable ties) are not included. Where a transformation mechanism cannot be explained from the data (e.g., how an interaction leads to output changes), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Small Blue/Light Blue components (low pixels, small/elongated bboxes) embedded within or adjacent to large colored blocks (high pixels, expansive bboxes)**:  
   In every input, small Blue or Light Blue components (pixels ≤5, bbox spans ≤3 units in any dimension) are consistently positioned inside or directly bordering the bboxes of larger blocks (e.g., Pink, Yellow, Green, Dark Red; pixels ≥12, bbox spans ≥4 units). Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Blues ([3,2,3,2], [4,3,4,3], etc.) inside Pink [0,0,4,9] and Yellow [8,0,11,9]; Light Blue [9,3,11,5] inside Yellow.  
   - Train 2 input: Blues ([6,0,7,2], [3,3,4,5]) inside Dark Red [0,0,7,5]; Light Blue [6,6,6,6] near Green [3,5,4,9].  
   - Train 3 input: Blues ([3,0,4,2], [6,3,8,4]) bordering/overlapping Pink [0,0,3,8] and inside Yellow [3,3,8,9].  
   - Train 4 input: Blues ([5,0,6,2], [3,3,5,4]) adjacent to Red [0,0,4,2] and inside Pink [2,3,6,6].  
   This embedding/adjacency suggests an interaction where small Blues modify or define edges/properties of large blocks (e.g., via position affecting block silhouette). In outputs, small Blues are absent or reduced (e.g., only Light Blue in train 2 output [5,8,7,9]), but the input interaction persists consistently; how it effects output reconfiguration is unknown.

2. **Overlapping bboxes between large blocks of different colors indicating layering**:  
   In every input and output, large blocks (pixels ≥12) of different colors consistently have overlapping bboxes, implying layering or superposition (one color partially covering another). No holes (all holes=0) means no enclosed voids disrupt this, keeping interactions simply connected. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Dark Red [0,0,11,12] overlaps Pink [0,0,4,9] and Yellow [8,0,11,9]; output: Green [0,0,12,11] overlaps Dark Red [0,0,9,3].  
   - Train 2 input: Dark Red [0,0,7,5] overlaps Maroon [0,3,2,9]; output: Green [0,3,2,9] overlaps Pink [0,0,7,7], Maroon [3,3,4,9] overlaps Pink.  
   - Train 3 input: Yellow [3,3,8,9] overlaps Pink [0,0,3,8]; output: Green [5,0,13,5] overlaps Pink [4,3,10,8], Maroon [1,3,3,8] overlaps Pink.  
   - Train 4 input: Green [7,0,9,9] overlaps Pink [2,3,6,6]; output: Green [0,3,6,6] overlaps Pink [0,0,6,2] and Pink [0,7,6,9].  
   This overlap is a consistent property linking colors (e.g., position of one block's bbox constrains another's layering), affecting composition density (pixels per bbox area varies but overlaps increase total density). Specific transformation from input to output overlaps is unknown.

3. **Position of large blocks relative to bottom edge (high y-values) affecting Maroon/Dark Red base formation**:  
   In every input where Maroon or large Dark Red/Red appears (all 4), their bboxes are consistently positioned at or near the bottom (max y ≥9, often spanning full width), interacting with other large blocks above them via adjacency or partial overlap. This ties position (y-coordinate) to base color properties. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Maroon [0,13,11,15] at bottom, adjacent to Dark Red [0,0,11,12] above; output has no Maroon, but Dark Red [13,0,15,11] extends vertically full height.  
   - Train 2 input: Maroon [0,3,2,9] low-mid, overlapping Dark Red [0,0,7,5]; output: Maroon [3,3,4,9] low, adjacent to Green [0,3,2,9].  
   - Train 3 input: Maroon [3,10,8,12] at bottom, adjacent to Yellow [3,3,8,9] above; output: Maroon [1,3,3,8] mid-low, layered under Pink [4,3,10,8].  
   - Train 4 input: Red [0,0,4,2] low but Green [7,0,9,9] full height acts as right base; output: Red [7,0,9,9] full height right base, Pink [0,7,6,9] bottom-adjacent.  
   Interaction: Bottom position links these base colors to vertical stacking of other blocks (e.g., Pink/Yellow above), influencing height properties. In outputs, bases shift but retain low-y adjacency; exact positional transformation effect is unknown.

4. **Pixel count relative to bbox area affecting shape irregularity (sparse vs. dense)**:  
   Across all inputs and outputs, components with pixels <80% of bbox area (e.g., width*(height) calculated from bbox) consistently indicate irregular/sparse shapes within the bbox, interacting with adjacent components via shared edges (inferred from bbox proximity). Dense components (pixels ≥90% bbox) form solid bases. This property is consistent and ties shape density to interaction potential (sparse ones border more others). Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Yellow [8,0,11,9] (bbox area ~40, pixels=35; ~88%, near-dense) borders sparse Blues; Dark Red [0,0,11,12] (~132 area, 53 pixels; ~40%, sparse) layers under all. Output: Green [0,0,12,11] (~143 area, 66 pixels; ~46%, sparse) overlaps Dark Red.  
   - Train 2 input: Green [8,0,9,3] (~28 area, 7 pixels; ~25%, sparse) adjacent to dense Dark Red [0,0,7,5] (~42 area, 28 pixels; ~67%). Output: Pink [0,0,7,7] (~64 area, 39 pixels; ~61%) layers over sparse Green [0,3,2,9] (~42 area, 21 pixels; ~50%).  
   - Train 3 input: Pink [0,0,3,8] (~72 area, 30 pixels; ~42%, sparse) overlaps dense Yellow [3,3,8,9] (~120 area, 28+1+6=35 pixels total for Yellow; ~29%). Output: Pink [4,3,10,8] (~126 area, 33 pixels; ~26%, sparse) under dense Green [5,0,13,5] (~144 area, 36 pixels; ~25%—wait, low but consistent sparsity interaction).  
   - Train 4 input: Green [7,0,9,9] (~90 area, 26 pixels; ~29%, sparse) borders dense Yellow [0,7,6,9] (~54 area, 21 pixels; ~39%). Output: Green [0,3,6,6] (~42 area, 28 pixels; ~67%, denser) stacks on Pink [0,0,6,2] (~42 area, 21 pixels; 50%).  
   Interaction: Sparse shapes (low pixels/bbox) consistently adjoin dense ones, potentially affecting edge interactions or movement along boundaries. How this property transforms (e.g., sparsity increasing in outputs) is unknown.

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent hole-based interactions (all train holes=0; no effects observable). Test inputs have holes=1 (e.g., Light Blue/Maroon), but this cannot be tied consistently without train examples.
- Elements like isolated single-pixel components (e.g., some Greens or small Pinks) show no repeatable connections across all examples and are excluded.
- Circular/rounded forms (Orange/Red) and jagged outlines appear sporadically and lack consistent ties (e.g., position or color effects vary); their interactions are unknown and not listed.
- Overall transformation from input interactions to output (e.g., how embedding leads to merging) cannot be explained from the data alone—requires visualization or additional rules, which is outside scope. No forced connections added.

[2025-10-02 08:28:44] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train input-output pairs (1-4), below is a list of only the obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (both inputs and outputs where applicable). I focused on properties like position, color, shape (inferred from bbox, pixels, and holes), and overlaps/adjacencies that show clear, repeated relationships. No high-level puzzle solution or total understanding is implied. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., single-pixel outliers with no relational ties) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., Orange circular forms, which appear in only 2/4 inputs and transform variably without repeatable ties) are not included. Where a transformation mechanism cannot be explained from the data (e.g., how an interaction leads to output changes), it is noted as unknown.

1. **Small Blue/Light Blue components (low pixels, small/elongated bboxes) embedded within or adjacent to large colored blocks (high pixels, expansive bboxes)**:  
   In every input, small Blue or Light Blue components (pixels ≤5, bbox spans ≤3 units in any dimension) are consistently positioned inside or directly bordering the bboxes of larger blocks (e.g., Pink, Yellow, Green, Dark Red; pixels ≥12, bbox spans ≥4 units). Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Blues ([3,2,3,2], [4,3,4,3], etc.) inside Pink [0,0,4,9] and Yellow [8,0,11,9]; Light Blue [9,3,11,5] inside Yellow.  
   - Train 2 input: Blues ([6,0,7,2], [3,3,4,5]) inside Dark Red [0,0,7,5]; Light Blue [6,6,6,6] near Green [3,5,4,9].  
   - Train 3 input: Blues ([3,0,4,2], [6,3,8,4]) bordering/overlapping Pink [0,0,3,8] and inside Yellow [3,3,8,9].  
   - Train 4 input: Blues ([5,0,6,2], [3,3,5,4]) adjacent to Red [0,0,4,2] and inside Pink [2,3,6,6].  
   This embedding/adjacency suggests an interaction where small Blues modify or define edges/properties of large blocks (e.g., via position affecting block silhouette). In outputs, small Blues are absent or reduced (e.g., only Light Blue in train 2 output [5,8,7,9]), but the input interaction persists consistently; how it effects output reconfiguration is unknown.

2. **Overlapping bboxes between large blocks of different colors indicating layering**:  
   In every input and output, large blocks (pixels ≥12) of different colors consistently have overlapping bboxes, implying layering or superposition (one color partially covering another). No holes (all holes=0) means no enclosed voids disrupt this, keeping interactions simply connected. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Dark Red [0,0,11,12] overlaps Pink [0,0,4,9] and Yellow [8,0,11,9]; output: Green [0,0,12,11] overlaps Dark Red [0,0,9,3].  
   - Train 2 input: Dark Red [0,0,7,5] overlaps Maroon [0,3,2,9]; output: Green [0,3,2,9] overlaps Pink [0,0,7,7], Maroon [3,3,4,9] overlaps Pink.  
   - Train 3 input: Yellow [3,3,8,9] overlaps Pink [0,0,3,8]; output: Green [5,0,13,5] overlaps Pink [4,3,10,8], Maroon [1,3,3,8] overlaps Pink.  
   - Train 4 input: Green [7,0,9,9] overlaps Pink [2,3,6,6]; output: Green [0,3,6,6] overlaps Pink [0,0,6,2] and Pink [0,7,6,9].  
   This overlap is a consistent property linking colors (e.g., position of one block's bbox constrains another's layering), affecting composition density (pixels per bbox area varies but overlaps increase total density). Specific transformation from input to output overlaps is unknown.

3. **Position of large blocks relative to bottom edge (high y-values) affecting Maroon/Dark Red base formation**:  
   In every input where Maroon or large Dark Red/Red appears (all 4), their bboxes are consistently positioned at or near the bottom (max y ≥9, often spanning full width), interacting with other large blocks above them via adjacency or partial overlap. This ties position (y-coordinate) to base color properties. Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Maroon [0,13,11,15] at bottom, adjacent to Dark Red [0,0,11,12] above; output has no Maroon, but Dark Red [13,0,15,11] extends vertically full height.  
   - Train 2 input: Maroon [0,3,2,9] low-mid, overlapping Dark Red [0,0,7,5]; output: Maroon [3,3,4,9] low, adjacent to Green [0,3,2,9].  
   - Train 3 input: Maroon [3,10,8,12] at bottom, adjacent to Yellow [3,3,8,9] above; output: Maroon [1,3,3,8] mid-low, layered under Pink [4,3,10,8].  
   - Train 4 input: Red [0,0,4,2] low but Green [7,0,9,9] full height acts as right base; output: Red [7,0,9,9] full height right base, Pink [0,7,6,9] bottom-adjacent.  
   Interaction: Bottom position links these base colors to vertical stacking of other blocks (e.g., Pink/Yellow above), influencing height properties. In outputs, bases shift but retain low-y adjacency; exact positional transformation effect is unknown.

4. **Pixel count relative to bbox area affecting shape irregularity (sparse vs. dense)**:  
   Across all inputs and outputs, components with pixels <80% of bbox area (e.g., width*(height) calculated from bbox) consistently indicate irregular/sparse shapes within the bbox, interacting with adjacent components via shared edges (inferred from bbox proximity). Dense components (pixels ≥90% bbox) form solid bases. This property is consistent and ties shape density to interaction potential (sparse ones border more others). Examples:  
   - Train 1 input: Yellow [8,0,11,9] (bbox area ~40, pixels=35; ~88%, near-dense) borders sparse Blues; Dark Red [0,0,11,12] (~132 area, 53 pixels; ~40%, sparse) layers under all. Output: Green [0,0,12,11] (~143 area, 66 pixels; ~46%, sparse) overlaps Dark Red.  
   - Train 2 input: Green [8,0,9,3] (~28 area, 7 pixels; ~25%, sparse) adjacent to dense Dark Red [0,0,7,5] (~42 area, 28 pixels; ~67%). Output: Pink [0,0,7,7] (~64 area, 39 pixels; ~61%) layers over sparse Green [0,3,2,9] (~42 area, 21 pixels; ~50%).  
   - Train 3 input: Pink [0,0,3,8] (~72 area, 30 pixels; ~42%, sparse) overlaps dense Yellow [3,3,8,9] (~120 area, 28+1+6=35 pixels total for Yellow; ~29%). Output: Pink [4,3,10,8] (~126 area, 33 pixels; ~26%, sparse) under dense Green [5,0,13,5] (~144 area, 36 pixels; ~25%—wait, low but consistent sparsity interaction).  
   - Train 4 input: Green [7,0,9,9] (~90 area, 26 pixels; ~29%, sparse) borders dense Yellow [0,7,6,9] (~54 area, 21 pixels; ~39%). Output: Green [0,3,6,6] (~42 area, 28 pixels; ~67%, denser) stacks on Pink [0,0,6,2] (~42 area, 21 pixels; 50%).  
   Interaction: Sparse shapes (low pixels/bbox) consistently adjoin dense ones, potentially affecting edge interactions or movement along boundaries. How this property transforms (e.g., sparsity increasing in outputs) is unknown.

### Notes on Limitations
- No consistent hole-based interactions (all train holes=0; no effects observable). Test inputs have holes=1 (e.g., Light Blue/Maroon), but this cannot be tied consistently without train examples.
- Elements like isolated single-pixel components (e.g., some Greens or small Pinks) show no repeatable connections across all examples and are excluded.
- Circular/rounded forms (Orange/Red) and jagged outlines appear sporadically and lack consistent ties (e.g., position or color effects vary); their interactions are unknown and not listed.
- Overall transformation from input interactions to output (e.g., how embedding leads to merging) cannot be explained from the data alone—requires visualization or additional rules, which is outside scope. No forced connections added.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-02 08:36:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers (likely representing colors or pixel values in a diagram), where the goal is to apply a sequence of transformations to clean up irregularities, resolve overlaps, standardize shapes, and possibly reorient the grid to match expected outputs that appear to depict structured patterns like layered shapes, bases, or objects with specific color distributions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], with rows as outer lists and columns as inner; dimensions vary (e.g., train1 seems ~12x16, train2 ~10x10, train3 ~9x14, train4 ~10x10), and outputs must preserve or adjust to match expected row counts and widths exactly.
 * Small "blue components" (value 1) need handling, possibly by replacement with surrounding or columnar context, but not blanket replacement as it over-simplifies sparse elements.
 * Overlapping bounding boxes suggest layered or merged shapes; resolution likely involves priority rules (e.g., max value, dominance by larger blobs) rather than simple max per row, and the placeholder implementation flattens incorrectly.
 * Base formation implies standardizing lower rows (e.g., filling bottoms with a uniform or modal value if height >=3), but must respect existing structure without overwriting everything above.
 * Shape irregularity handling aims to regularize sparse or jagged columns by filling with modes or interpolating, but applying full-column fills creates uniform blocks that erase details like gradients or protrusions.
 * Transposition (zip(*g)) rotates the grid 90 degrees, which may be needed for reorientation but is misplaced at the end, leading to vertical single-column outputs instead of horizontal rows.
 * Expected outputs show patterns like uniform top sections, irregular middles with specific color blobs (e.g., 3's in bases, 7's in bodies), and sparse bottoms (0's), suggesting object extraction, segmentation, or morphological operations (e.g., filling holes, connecting components) rather than pure statistical modes.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve 0's as empty space; handle multi-color blobs (e.g., 3,6,7,8,9 mixing); account for asymmetric shapes (e.g., train2 has diagonal shifts); avoid over-regularization that turns complex patterns into solids; consider vertical vs. horizontal dominance in modes; grids may represent 2D images of 3D-like puzzles (e.g., stacked blocks with bases).
 * All transformations must chain correctly without dimension loss; outputs are printed as row lists, so final format must be wide rows, not tall columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_column_modes(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    modes = []
    for c in range(cols):
        col_values = [g[r][c] for r in range(rows)]
        counter = Counter(col_values)
        mode = counter.most_common(1)[0][0]
        modes.append(mode)
    return modes
```
(This computes per-column most common values, useful for regularization but needs refinement to avoid ignoring minorities or 0's.)

```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(Useful for reorientation if the puzzle requires rotating the final grid, but timing and necessity depend on input orientation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a pipeline of handle_small_blue_components (replaces 1's with column modes: worked conceptually for filling gaps but over-applied, turning sparse blues into dominant colors prematurely).
 * handle_overlapping_bboxes was broken (simplified to max per row or identity, causing flattening/loss of vertical structure; not helpful—avoid in future as it doesn't resolve true overlaps like stacked blobs).
 * handle_base_formation incorrectly approximated bottom mode and overwrote only last 3 rows without checking content, leading to mismatched bases (e.g., train1 expected mixed 0/3/7 bottoms but got uniform 7's).
 * handle_shape_irregularity filled entire grid with column modes, which erased all variation (unhelpful for preserving shapes; too aggressive—don't reuse as-is).
 * Final transpose turned wide grids into 1-wide tall ones, mismatching all expected wide-row formats (core issue: dimensions inverted, e.g., train1 generated 16x1 vs. expected ~12x16).
 * Train1: Generated uniform vertical [7]/[9]/[8] stacks; differed from expected by lacking horizontal structure, wrong row count (16 vs. 12), no 0/3 bases, and over-filled top with 7's instead of mixed 7/3.
 * Train2: Generated vertical [7]/[8]/[9]; differed by single-column format, wrong heights (e.g., 10x1 vs. 10x10), ignored diagonal 8/9 shifts and base 3's, resulting in no pattern match.
 * Train3: Generated vertical [6]/[5]/[9]; differed by 1-wide vs. 9x14, lost middle layer details (e.g., expected 7/8/6 mixes became uniform), and mismatched bottom 4's with 5/9.
 * Train4: Generated irregular vertical [3]/[6]/[4]; differed by 1-wide vs. 10x10, partial mode filling caught some 6/3 but scrambled order/heights, missing uniform top 6's and base 2's.
 * Overall: No training samples passed; attempt showed partial understanding of modes/bases but failed on chaining, dimensions, and subtlety (e.g., didn't extract or segment objects like blobs of 3's or 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is 30 rows of single-element [9], creating a uniform vertical tower of 9's, which does not look correct—it ignores any input structure, over-applies modes (assuming 9 dominates), and inverts dimensions to 30x1 (likely from a wider input post-transpose).
 * This fails to match puzzle patterns seen in training (e.g., no bases, mixes, or 0's); it suggests the pipeline homogenized everything to one color without preserving shapes, making it nonsensical for a visual puzzle expecting layered or irregular outputs.
 * To handle test, must avoid full-grid filling, fix transpose placement/dimensions, and incorporate object detection (e.g., connected components for blobs) to retain details like sparse elements or overlaps.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:36:19] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train puzzle (inputs 1-4 and their corresponding outputs) and demonstrate clear, recurring relationships (e.g., position influencing size, presence affecting absence). I focused only on consistent patterns without inferring or forcing unobservable connections (e.g., no assumed adjacency without bbox evidence, no semantic interpretations like "maze paths"). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small shapes with no bbox overlap or proximity to others) were excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., variable color changes like dark red → pink in train 2 but dark red → unchanged in train 4) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained as a consistent interaction.

- **Small blue components (properties: holes=0, small bbox spans typically 1-2 units, pixels=1 or 4) interact with large rectangular blocks via position and embedding**: In every input, small blue components are positioned within or partially overlapping the bounding boxes (bbox) of large blocks (e.g., pink [0,0,4,9] overlaps blues at [3,2-3,4] in train 1; green [7,0,9,9] overlaps blue [7,3,8,5] in train 4). This positional embedding is consistent across all inputs. In every output, small blue components are entirely absent, while the affected large blocks show altered bbox (expanded or shifted, e.g., input pink/yellow bboxes [0,0,4,9] and [8,0,11,9] expand to output green [0,0,12,11] in train 1). This suggests a consistent interaction where blue position drives transformation of the host block's geometry, but the exact mechanism (e.g., directional expansion) is unknown.

- **Large rectangular blocks (properties: holes=0, large bbox spans >5 units, pixels>20) interact with small blue components via pixel count and size expansion**: Every input features large blocks containing or adjacent to small blues (bbox overlap as above). Every corresponding output shows these large blocks with increased pixel counts compared to their input counterparts (e.g., input dark red 53 pixels transforms to output dark red 40 + 36 = 76 total in train 1; input green 26 pixels expands to 28 in train 4). Total output pixel sums are consistently lower than input sums (e.g., 142 vs. ~190 in train 1), implying blues (total ~10-20 pixels across inputs) contribute to but are not fully conserved in the expansion. This indicates a consistent catalytic interaction where blues add to or redistribute pixels in large blocks, but the redistribution rule (e.g., how pixels are allocated) is unknown.

- **Green components interact with adjacent or embedded small blues via bbox expansion and position shift**: In every input, green components (small or large) are near or overlapped by small blues (e.g., input green [3,5,4,9] bbox adjoins blue [3,3,4,5] in train 2; input green [5,0,8,2] overlaps blue [6,3,8,4] indirectly via proximity in train 3). Every output features a single, expanded green component with bbox that incorporates positions of input greens and nearby blues (e.g., input greens at [8,0,9,3]/[3,5,4,9]/[8,5,9,9] merge into output green [0,3,2,9] shifted left in train 2). Pixel count for green consistently increases (max input green < output green in all cases, e.g., 12 → 36 in train 3). This shows a consistent interaction where blue proximity causes green expansion/merging, but color preservation or shift details (e.g., why not all greens expand equally) are unknown.

- **Compositional layout (adjacency of bboxes) interacts with small blue positions to reduce component count**: Every input has 10+ components with overlapping or adjacent bboxes (e.g., pink [0,0,3,8] adjoins yellow [3,3,8,9] near blues [6,3,8,4] in train 3). Every output has fewer components (3-6 vs. 10+ in inputs), with output bboxes consistently spanning multiple input bboxes connected via blue positions (e.g., input maroon [0,3,2,9]/green [3,5,4,9] adjacent via blue [1,5,2,7] merge into separate but adjacent output green/maroon in train 2). This indicates a consistent interaction where blue-positioned adjacencies drive component reduction/merging, but the selection criteria for which adjacencies merge (vs. stay separate) is unknown.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No consistent interactions involving holes**: All components in every input and output have holes=0, so no observable effect (e.g., no hole count → color or position changes).
- **No consistent color-to-color mappings**: Colors like pink, yellow, dark red, and maroon persist or change variably (e.g., yellow unchanged in train 3 output but absent in train 4; pink expands in train 4 but merges to green in train 1). Specific rules (e.g., blue → green change) are not consistent across all puzzles and are unknown.
- **No consistent interactions for other small non-blue components (e.g., small orange, light blue, pink)**: These appear in some inputs (e.g., orange in train 3, light blue in train 2) and sometimes expand in outputs (e.g., light blue 1 → 6 pixels), but not in every puzzle (absent or removed in train 1/4). Their interaction with blues or large blocks varies and is not consistent.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Standalone small components without bbox overlap/proximity to large blocks or greens (e.g., isolated dark red [11,12,11,12] in train 1) show no consistent transformation effect and were ignored.
- **Pixelated textures and irregular shapes**: Described as present but show no consistent interaction (e.g., no texture → movement or color effect observable in data; irregularities implied in output but not quantifiable in bbox/pixels).

No full transformation explanation is possible or attempted; the above are only the obvious, consistent connections derivable from the data.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-02 08:39:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train puzzle (inputs 1-4 and their corresponding outputs) and demonstrate clear, recurring relationships (e.g., position influencing size, presence affecting absence). I focused only on consistent patterns without inferring or forcing unobservable connections (e.g., no assumed adjacency without bbox evidence, no semantic interpretations like "maze paths"). Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone small shapes with no bbox overlap or proximity to others) were excluded. Inconsistent patterns (e.g., variable color changes like dark red → pink in train 2 but dark red → unchanged in train 4) are noted as unknown where they cannot be explained as a consistent interaction.

- **Small blue components (properties: holes=0, small bbox spans typically 1-2 units, pixels=1 or 4) interact with large rectangular blocks via position and embedding**: In every input, small blue components are positioned within or partially overlapping the bounding boxes (bbox) of large blocks (e.g., pink [0,0,4,9] overlaps blues at [3,2-3,4] in train 1; green [7,0,9,9] overlaps blue [7,3,8,5] in train 4). This positional embedding is consistent across all inputs. In every output, small blue components are entirely absent, while the affected large blocks show altered bbox (expanded or shifted, e.g., input pink/yellow bboxes [0,0,4,9] and [8,0,11,9] expand to output green [0,0,12,11] in train 1). This suggests a consistent interaction where blue position drives transformation of the host block's geometry, but the exact mechanism (e.g., directional expansion) is unknown.

- **Large rectangular blocks (properties: holes=0, large bbox spans >5 units, pixels>20) interact with small blue components via pixel count and size expansion**: Every input features large blocks containing or adjacent to small blues (bbox overlap as above). Every corresponding output shows these large blocks with increased pixel counts compared to their input counterparts (e.g., input dark red 53 pixels transforms to output dark red 40 + 36 = 76 total in train 1; input green 26 pixels expands to 28 in train 4). Total output pixel sums are consistently lower than input sums (e.g., 142 vs. ~190 in train 1), implying blues (total ~10-20 pixels across inputs) contribute to but are not fully conserved in the expansion. This indicates a consistent catalytic interaction where blues add to or redistribute pixels in large blocks, but the redistribution rule (e.g., how pixels are allocated) is unknown.

- **Green components interact with adjacent or embedded small blues via bbox expansion and position shift**: In every input, green components (small or large) are near or overlapped by small blues (e.g., input green [3,5,4,9] bbox adjoins blue [3,3,4,5] in train 2; input green [5,0,8,2] overlaps blue [6,3,8,4] indirectly via proximity in train 3). Every output features a single, expanded green component with bbox that incorporates positions of input greens and nearby blues (e.g., input greens at [8,0,9,3]/[3,5,4,9]/[8,5,9,9] merge into output green [0,3,2,9] shifted left in train 2). Pixel count for green consistently increases (max input green < output green in all cases, e.g., 12 → 36 in train 3). This shows a consistent interaction where blue proximity causes green expansion/merging, but color preservation or shift details (e.g., why not all greens expand equally) are unknown.

- **Compositional layout (adjacency of bboxes) interacts with small blue positions to reduce component count**: Every input has 10+ components with overlapping or adjacent bboxes (e.g., pink [0,0,3,8] adjoins yellow [3,3,8,9] near blues [6,3,8,4] in train 3). Every output has fewer components (3-6 vs. 10+ in inputs), with output bboxes consistently spanning multiple input bboxes connected via blue positions (e.g., input maroon [0,3,2,9]/green [3,5,4,9] adjacent via blue [1,5,2,7] merge into separate but adjacent output green/maroon in train 2). This indicates a consistent interaction where blue-positioned adjacencies drive component reduction/merging, but the selection criteria for which adjacencies merge (vs. stay separate) is unknown.

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No consistent interactions involving holes**: All components in every input and output have holes=0, so no observable effect (e.g., no hole count → color or position changes).
- **No consistent color-to-color mappings**: Colors like pink, yellow, dark red, and maroon persist or change variably (e.g., yellow unchanged in train 3 output but absent in train 4; pink expands in train 4 but merges to green in train 1). Specific rules (e.g., blue → green change) are not consistent across all puzzles and are unknown.
- **No consistent interactions for other small non-blue components (e.g., small orange, light blue, pink)**: These appear in some inputs (e.g., orange in train 3, light blue in train 2) and sometimes expand in outputs (e.g., light blue 1 → 6 pixels), but not in every puzzle (absent or removed in train 1/4). Their interaction with blues or large blocks varies and is not consistent.
- **Irrelevant elements excluded**: Standalone small components without bbox overlap/proximity to large blocks or greens (e.g., isolated dark red [11,12,11,12] in train 1) show no consistent transformation effect and were ignored.
- **Pixelated textures and irregular shapes**: Described as present but show no consistent interaction (e.g., no texture → movement or color effect observable in data; irregularities implied in output but not quantifiable in bbox/pixels).

No full transformation explanation is possible or attempted; the above are only the obvious, consistent connections derivable from the data.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 08:49:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 0 for background, 1 for small blue markers, 3 for green, and higher numbers for large colored blocks), where the goal is to segment and expand regions into bounding boxes, prioritize filling by area, and reconstruct a simplified output grid by filling these expanded blocks while handling special cases for green (full-height strip) and zero (bottom-left block). The program attempts to identify and expand these regions based on proximity to blue markers but fails due to runtime errors, preventing any valid output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids may need transposition if height != width, suggesting inputs could be rotated or non-square.
 * Small blues (value 1) act as anchors for expanding nearby large blocks (colors >1 with count >20 and span >5), using bounding boxes that grow by 1 cell in all directions if a blue is inside.
 * Large blocks are detected via min/max row/col and count thresholds to filter noise; subtle: only non-0/1 colors qualify, and expansion is per-blue but applied once per block.
 * Green (3) requires special full-height vertical strip expansion to width 3 centered on average column, with minor proximity-based tweaks to blues within Chebyshev distance 2; easy to miss: fallback to dummy if no green, and overriding to full height regardless of original span.
 * Zero (0) regions get special bottom-left expansion to full remaining height and ~1/3 width, also with proximity to blues; subtle: uses average row for starting minr, but clamps to bottom; dummy if no zeros.
 * No merging of overlapping blocks; instead, fills in area-descending order, with remaining cells defaulting to the largest block's color.
 * Outputs must match input dimensions (possibly after transpose); subtle: all fills use max(0,min(H-1,...)) clamping to avoid index errors.
 * Potential for empty regions or no blues/large blocks, requiring dummies to avoid crashes.
 * Errors suggest index issues, likely from assuming non-empty bboxes or unpacking tuples incorrectly (e.g., green_block[3] instead of green_block[1][3]).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it structures the problem around detecting/expanding color blocks with blues as anchors, special-handling green/zero, and priority-filling, showing partial understanding of segmentation and expansion rules.
 * What worked: Functions like get_small_blue and get_large_blocks correctly identify blues and large regions without errors in isolation; bbox calculation and area-sorting for fill order are logical for prioritizing dominant blocks.
 * What didn't work: Runtime errors ("tuple index out of range") on all training examples 1-4 and test input, likely from accessing bbox tuples incorrectly (e.g., green_block[3] instead of green_block[1][3] when checking validity, or unpacking empty results); no valid outputs generated, so cannot assess logic accuracy.
 * Transposition logic (if H != W) is attempted but may contribute to errors if grids are empty or malformed.
 * expand_green and expand_zero have special overrides (full-height strip for green, bottom-left for zero) that seem puzzle-specific but are buggy (e.g., proximity loop doesn't accumulate expansions properly, and avg_c calculation assumes len>0).
 * merge_overlapping is a no-op (just returns as-is), which is simple but unhelpful for overlaps; fill order relies on sorting, but defaults to largest color for remnants—may overfill if blocks don't cover grid.
 * No handling for edge cases like no blues/large blocks (dummies used but validity check green_block[3][2] fails on tuple access); overall, code crashes before filling, so no observed effects beyond errors.
 * Function expand_blocks is somewhat helpful but too simplistic (expands only if blue inside original bbox, not proximity); expand_green/zero are attempt at subtleties but broken due to index errors and non-accumulating expansions.

**Test output:**
 * No valid test output generated; all attempts (this single one) result in "ERROR - Execution error: tuple index out of range", so it does not make sense or look correct—execution fails entirely, preventing any grid reconstruction.
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with expanded blocks (e.g., large colors grown around blues, green as vertical strip, zero as bottom-left, remnants defaulted), but since code crashes on bbox access (likely in validity checks like if green_block[3][2] > ...), it produces nothing usable; difference is total failure vs. a potentially matching segmented grid.
 * Without running mentally (as grid not provided), errors indicate the program cannot handle the test input's structure (e.g., missing green/zero leading to invalid dummies or empty tuples), making it incorrect by default.

This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input-output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train example (inputs and outputs) and show clear, repeatable relationships (e.g., presence, position affecting extent, or color preservation with modification). Only low-level, direct connections are included—no high-level interpretations, forced explanations, or elements irrelevant to all examples (e.g., Orange appears only in trains 2 and 3, so excluded; Light Blue appears in inputs/outputs of 1, 2, and 3 but not 4, so excluded; hole count is always 0 with no variation or effect, so no interaction identified). If a transformation cannot be pinpointed beyond presence or basic property linkage, it is noted as unknown. No test inputs were used, as they lack outputs for verification of consistency.

- **Green color presence and position interaction with overall canvas extent**: Green is present in every input and every output. In inputs, Green always starts with at least one small component (bbox width/height ≤2, pixels ≤12); in outputs, Green always expands to a large component (bbox covering ≥20% of canvas height/width based on max coordinates, pixels ≥21). The final output position of Green consistently overlaps or adjoins the initial input Green positions (e.g., y-ranges shift but retain partial overlap in vertical partitioning), suggesting position of input Green affects output extent. Exact expansion mechanism (e.g., how pixels increase) is unknown.

- **Small Blue components (pixels=1 or 4) position affecting Green output position**: Small Blue components (defined by pixels=1 or 4, bbox size ≤2 in any dimension) are present in every input (≥4 per example). Their positions consistently correlate with the bounding box edges of the expanded Green in outputs (e.g., Blues near left/center in input lead to Green bbox starting near x=0 or covering mid-canvas in output, across all 4 pairs). This indicates position of small Blues interacts with Green's positional transformation. No color change for Blues themselves is observed (they disappear in outputs), and exact causal mechanism is unknown.

- **Red color variants (Dark Red/Red/Maroon) preservation with positional shift**: Red variants (Dark Red, Red, or Maroon) are present in every input and every output (treating Red as equivalent based on naming/shading similarity). Input red components (total pixels ≥15 combined) consistently map to output red components with similar total pixels (±10% variance) but shifted positions (e.g., input left-side reds move rightward or vertically in bbox by ≥2 units in all 4 pairs). This suggests red colors interact internally via position transformation, without loss of the color family. Pixel count changes and exact shift rules are unknown; no interaction with non-red colors is consistently observed for reds.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., Pink position -> color change, Yellow extent -> anything, or pixel count -> hole creation) were identifiable across all 4 examples, as they vary or are absent in at least one pair. Components like Yellow or Pink show sporadic presence/transformation but no universal linkage.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the 4 train input-output pairs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties or components that appear in **every** train example (inputs and outputs) and show clear, repeatable relationships (e.g., presence, position affecting extent, or color preservation with modification). Only low-level, direct connections are included—no high-level interpretations, forced explanations, or elements irrelevant to all examples (e.g., Orange appears only in trains 2 and 3, so excluded; Light Blue appears in inputs/outputs of 1, 2, and 3 but not 4, so excluded; hole count is always 0 with no variation or effect, so no interaction identified). If a transformation cannot be pinpointed beyond presence or basic property linkage, it is noted as unknown. No test inputs were used, as they lack outputs for verification of consistency.

- **Green color presence and position interaction with overall canvas extent**: Green is present in every input and every output. In inputs, Green always starts with at least one small component (bbox width/height ≤2, pixels ≤12); in outputs, Green always expands to a large component (bbox covering ≥20% of canvas height/width based on max coordinates, pixels ≥21). The final output position of Green consistently overlaps or adjoins the initial input Green positions (e.g., y-ranges shift but retain partial overlap in vertical partitioning), suggesting position of input Green affects output extent. Exact expansion mechanism (e.g., how pixels increase) is unknown.

- **Small Blue components (pixels=1 or 4) position affecting Green output position**: Small Blue components (defined by pixels=1 or 4, bbox size ≤2 in any dimension) are present in every input (≥4 per example). Their positions consistently correlate with the bounding box edges of the expanded Green in outputs (e.g., Blues near left/center in input lead to Green bbox starting near x=0 or covering mid-canvas in output, across all 4 pairs). This indicates position of small Blues interacts with Green's positional transformation. No color change for Blues themselves is observed (they disappear in outputs), and exact causal mechanism is unknown.

- **Red color variants (Dark Red/Red/Maroon) preservation with positional shift**: Red variants (Dark Red, Red, or Maroon) are present in every input and every output (treating Red as equivalent based on naming/shading similarity). Input red components (total pixels ≥15 combined) consistently map to output red components with similar total pixels (±10% variance) but shifted positions (e.g., input left-side reds move rightward or vertically in bbox by ≥2 units in all 4 pairs). This suggests red colors interact internally via position transformation, without loss of the color family. Pixel count changes and exact shift rules are unknown; no interaction with non-red colors is consistently observed for reds.

No other consistent interactions (e.g., Pink position -> color change, Yellow extent -> anything, or pixel count -> hole creation) were identifiable across all 4 examples, as they vary or are absent in at least one pair. Components like Yellow or Pink show sporadic presence/transformation but no universal linkage.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-02 08:58:26] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transposes the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Main program: applies transposition as the core transformation."""
    return transpose_grid(g)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-02 08:59:01] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids with numerical patterns (likely representing shapes, regions, or objects) are processed to produce output grids with reorganized or simplified patterns, often featuring uniform blocks of numbers, repeated rows, or extracted substructures. The goal appears to be identifying and reconstructing specific visual elements like blobs, lines, or filled areas while preserving certain symmetries or rules, but the exact transformation (e.g., extraction, mirroring, or filtering) remains unclear from failed attempts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (0-9) to denote colors, fills, or object boundaries; uniform blocks (e.g., all 7s or 3s) in expected outputs suggest collapsing or highlighting connected regions rather than direct copying or simple swaps.
 * Expected outputs often have repeated identical rows (e.g., multiple rows of [7,7,7,...3,3,3,7,7,7] in Training 1), indicating vertical stacking or replication of horizontal patterns, which transposition ignores.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have scattered numbers (e.g., 1s as connectors or holes?), but outputs simplify to solid blocks, possibly filtering out noise or small objects.
 * Boundaries and edges matter; expected outputs trim or extend regions (e.g., Training 2 shifts 3s and 8s into aligned blocks, unlike scattered generated versions).
 * No rotation or full reversal seen; instead, partial reorganization, like promoting certain numbers (e.g., 3s expanding in Training 1) while demoting others (e.g., 0s or 1s disappearing).
 * Grids may represent layered objects (e.g., backgrounds of 9s or 6s with foreground patterns); outputs prioritize foreground or specific layers.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs maintain grid dimensions but alter content non-uniformly; e.g., Training 3 expected has stacked 5s and 3s, then mixed 7/8/6/4 blocks, suggesting object separation by value.
 * All examples show outputs with fewer variations per row than inputs, implying aggregation or rule-based filling (e.g., flood-fill connected components).
 * Consider object connectivity: Numbers like 6 or 9 might be backgrounds, while 3/0/1 form shapes that get extracted and repositioned.
 * No evidence of arithmetic operations; purely structural (e.g., copy-paste blocks with modifications).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transposes the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition; do not reuse without modification for object detection.)

No other helpful functions from attempts; future ones might need connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill for regions of same number) or pattern matching for blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple transposition, which worked nowhere: it correctly swaps rows/columns but fails to reorganize into the blocky, repeated patterns in expected outputs.
 * Training 1 generated: Scattered 6s/7s/8s with misplaced 1s/0s/3s/9s/4s (e.g., row [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,1,7,8,8,8] vs. expected uniform [7s then 3s]); differs by not collapsing to solid blocks or repeating rows—unknown why 1s/0s appear as artifacts, but they disrupt uniformity.
 * Training 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/1s/3s/9s/5s/6s (e.g., row [7,7,7,8,8,1,1,1,8,8] vs. expected [6s then 7s]); differs in scattering small numbers (1s/5s/6s) instead of aligning 3/8/6/7 blocks—transposition mixes columns incorrectly without extracting shapes.
 * Training 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/1s/4s/8s/7s (e.g., row [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,9,5,5,5] vs. expected stacked 5s/3s); differs by fragmenting regions (e.g., isolated 5s/9s) rather than creating vertical stacks or horizontal alignments—ignores object boundaries.
 * Training 4 generated: Disordered 2s/6s/1s/3s/4s (e.g., row [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected stacked 6s/3s/2s); differs by not replicating rows or prioritizing 6/3/2 blocks—small 1s act as noise not filtered out.
 * Transposition is broken for this puzzle: It preserves no visual semantics (e.g., doesn't handle connected regions or repetitions), leading to all mismatches; avoid in future as it's irrelevant.
 * No object extraction attempted, missing core need to identify blobs (e.g., groups of 3s) for repositioning.
 * All trainings mismatch in scale: Generated has more variation per row; expected simplifies to fewer distinct segments.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It appears as a partially transposed grid with scattered 9s/6s/3s/0s/1s/8s/2s/7s/4s, creating irregular patches (e.g., row [9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9] has abrupt shifts), unlike the uniform blocks/repetitions in training expecteds.
 * It fails to simplify: Dense 9s dominate but fragment into small 0/1/2 intrusions, suggesting no region aggregation—expected likely has cleaner layers (e.g., solid 9 backgrounds with extracted 6/3/2 shapes stacked).
 * Dimensions match (30 cols, ~27 rows?), but content is noisy; e.g., late rows introduce 7/4/1 without clear pattern, while expecteds avoid such scatter—does not account for filtering small objects or extending blocks.
 * Overall, resembles raw transposition artifacts (e.g., diagonal-like spreads of 0s/1s), not a valid puzzle solution; mentally, correct output should replicate training style with repeated uniform rows of dominant numbers (9/6 base, overlaid 3/2 patterns).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-02 08:59:16] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 4 training examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** input-output pair. These are limited to properties or components that appear in all examples and show clear, repeatable effects or dependencies (e.g., presence, adjacency, or transformation influence). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., Orange, which appears in only 2/4 inputs and transforms differently each time; Yellow, which is absent in 1/4 and transforms inconsistently; Maroon/Dark Red/Red, which vary in presence and effect) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation rules are inferred—only direct, consistent links are noted. Where a connection's mechanism cannot be explained from the data (e.g., exact how/why of a change), it is marked as unknown.

- **Blue shapes → Green regions (positional adjacency influences size/position transformation)**:  
  Blue components (small bars or clusters, always holes=0, low pixels=1-4) are consistently present in every input (multiple instances, total pixels 10-20 across examples) and positioned adjacent to or overlapping Green regions (horizontally/vertically within 1-2 units in bbox coordinates). In every output, this results in a transformed Green region (single prominent Green with holes=0, bbox expanded or shifted, pixels 21-66). The adjacency is consistent (Blues never isolated from Green), but the exact transformation mechanism (e.g., why bbox expands left/right in some cases) is unknown.

- **Blue shapes → Pink regions (positional embedding influences merging or color preservation)**:  
  Blue components are consistently embedded within or directly adjacent to Pink regions in every input (Blues inside Pink bboxes or sharing edges). Every output preserves a Pink region (holes=0, pixels 21-39, bbox often similar but expanded horizontally). The embedding link is consistent (no input Pink without nearby Blue), suggesting Blue position affects Pink boundary adjustment, but the precise rule for pixel increase or bbox shift is unknown.

- **Green regions ↔ Pink regions (spatial overlap or adjacency drives mutual transformation)**:  
  In every input, Green and Pink regions are consistently adjacent or overlapping in bbox (e.g., shared x/y ranges within 1-3 units, no full separation). Every output shows both colors preserved but with altered bboxes that reflect the input overlap (e.g., Green's expansion encroaching on Pink's original space, or vice versa). This mutual spatial dependency is consistent across all examples, but the direction/mechanism of boundary resolution (e.g., which color "wins" pixels) is unknown.

- **Pixel count (area) of Blue → overall output consolidation**:  
  Total pixels of all Blue shapes in inputs (consistent range 10-20) correlates with output having fewer but larger components (3-6 regions total, each >20 pixels). This suggests Blue pixel density acts as a "consolidation trigger" for merging adjacent colors (Green/Pink), observed in every example, but the scaling formula (e.g., how Blue pixels map to output size increase) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., holes are always 0 in trains, so no hole-based effects; no consistent color-to-color swaps like Yellow→Green; no reliable position-to-color changes across all). Test inputs follow similar patterns (e.g., Blues adjacent to Green/Pink), but cannot confirm outputs without data.

[2025-10-02 09:00:24] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based inputs represented as 2D lists of integers (likely pixel-like values for colors or shapes), where the goal is to transform the input into an output grid that simplifies or reinterprets the visual patterns into large uniform blocks or regions, possibly by identifying and filling connected components, propagating boundaries, or applying symmetry/rotation rules to create stylized, blocky representations. The outputs emphasize horizontal or vertical stripes of consistent values, suggesting rules around region expansion, omission of noise, or mirroring that preserve overall structure but simplify details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently feature large, uniform blocks or stripes of the same number (e.g., rows or sections filled with 7s, 3s, 0s), indicating a need to detect and expand connected regions rather than preserving exact pixel values—subtle noise or small variations in input are likely ignored or filled over.
 * Patterns suggest possible rotation, mirroring, or axis-based propagation (e.g., vertical lines becoming horizontal blocks), but not simple transpose, as outputs maintain aspect ratios and block orientations that align with input visuals rather than just swapping rows/columns.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: small isolated values (e.g., 1s or outliers) are often omitted or absorbed into surrounding blocks, while key structural elements (e.g., dividers or blobs) are preserved and expanded—easy to miss that boundaries might "bleed" or fill adjacent areas.
 * Consider grid dimensions: inputs vary (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), but outputs match input size, so transformations must be in-place or reshaping without dimension change; subtle padding or edge effects may occur in non-square grids.
 * Across examples, dominant values (e.g., 6,7,8) form the bulk of blocks, while minor ones (e.g., 1,0) appear in specific positions like corners or transitions—rules likely prioritize majority regions and suppress minorities unless they form distinct objects.
 * Potential for object extraction: inputs may contain "objects" like shapes or blobs (connected same-value cells), which need to be identified, then redrawn in output with filled interiors or outlines; missing this leads to pixel-level copies instead of abstracted blocks.
 * Symmetry and repetition: many expected outputs repeat rows (e.g., 4 identical rows of 7s), hinting at vertical mirroring or replication of horizontal slices—subtle that this isn't uniform across the grid but segmented by value changes.
 * Noise handling: generated outputs retain scattered small values (e.g., isolated 1s, 0s), but expected clean them up into blocks, so rules must include thresholding or flood-filling.
 * All training examples failed, emphasizing that low-level operations like transpose ignore high-level visual semantics.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used only transposition (zip(*g)), which swapped rows and columns but failed to abstract or fill regions, resulting in jumbled, non-blocky outputs that preserved exact values without simplification—e.g., in Training 1, generated scattered 6s/7s/8s with outliers like 1s/0s, while expected clean horizontal blocks of 7s (top 4 rows), 3s (next 4), and 0s (bottom 4) with precise right-side transitions.
 * Training 1: Generated had vertical stripes of 6s/7s/4s mixed with noise (e.g., row 0: [6]*10 + [7,7,7,8,8,8]), differing from expected uniform rows (e.g., first 4 rows all [7]*10 + [3,3,3,7,7,7]); unknown why transpose produced those specific values, but it mismatched block uniformity and omitted 0-block expansion.
 * Training 2: Generated messy 10x10 with scattered 7s/8s/3s/1s (e.g., row 0: [7,7,7,8]*3), vs. expected top 3 rows of [6]*8 + [7,7], then 5 rows of [3,3,3,8,8,6]*3 + [7,7], and bottom 2 of [3]*3 + [8,8,9,9,9,7,7]; transpose failed to create the repeating 6/8 blocks and introduced irrelevant 1s/5s/9s.
 * Training 3: Generated irregular 9x14 with mixed 6s/5s/3s/4s/1s/8s (e.g., row 0: [6]*9 + [5,9,9,9,5]), vs. expected top 3 rows [5]*5 + [3]*9, then 3 rows [7,8]*3 + [6,3]*3 + [6]*3 + [4]*3, and bottom 3 [7,8]*3 + [6]*7 + [4]*3; differences include failure to group 5s/3s into left blocks and expand 6/4 rights, with generated retaining small 1s/9s as noise.
 * Training 4: Generated 10x10 with scattered 2s/6s/1s/3s/4s (e.g., row 0: [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]), vs. expected top 3 and bottom 3 rows [6]*7 + [2]*3, middle 4 [3]*7 + [2]*3; transpose scrambled into non-uniform rows, missing the alternating 6/3 block pattern and filling outliers like 1s into blocks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which is essential for identifying blobs to fill—transpose is broken for this puzzle as it doesn't handle connectivity or abstraction (don't use it in future).
 * All attempts (just one) missed core simplification to blocks, leading to 100% incorrect results; subtle repetition in expected (e.g., identical rows) was ignored.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (30x30? irregular lines suggest non-square, but jumbled with 30 elements per row) does not look correct, as it retains high noise and fragmentation (e.g., row 0: [9]*14 + [6]*14 + [9]*2, but mixes in scattered 3s/0s/1s/8s/2s across rows, creating no clear blocks—in row 12: introduces unrelated [0,1,1,1,6,6,9]* etc., which seems like transposed artifacts).
 * It fails to produce expected blocky structure, likely uniform 9/6/3/0/2/8 regions based on patterns from training (e.g., large top 9-blocks, mid 6/0 stripes, bottom 4/8 fills), instead showing irregular spreads (e.g., 2s clustering mid-right but not expanded, 1s as noise); this doesn't make sense visually, as it looks like raw transpose without filling, missing the puzzle's abstraction to clean, repeating stripes.
 * To handle test, must account for larger/more complex inputs with multiple nested regions (e.g., inner 0/1/2 clusters within 3/9 areas), requiring robust region extraction and expansion rules not present in the attempt.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored regions or shapes) are processed into output grids that appear to simplify, fill, or reorganize patterns into larger uniform blocks or structured regions, possibly by identifying connected components, propagating values, or applying symmetry/rotation rules. The goal is to match the exact expected outputs, which often feature repeating rows of consistent numbers forming bands or blobs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs often create horizontal bands of identical numbers across rows, suggesting a rule for filling or averaging regions vertically/horizontally, but with precise boundaries that preserve some original structure (e.g., in Training 1, top 4 rows are all 7s with a 3-column exception on the right; bottom has 0s transitioning to 3s).
 * Subtle element: Outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate scattered numbers into solid blocks (e.g., in Training 1 expected, 7s dominate upper half, 3s in middle, 0s at bottom with right-side 7s; generated has irregular 6s, 1s, 4s, 9s scattered, ignoring block formation).
 * Connected regions or "blobs" of the same number seem key, but not simple flood-filling—outputs expand or select dominant values per row/column while preserving some irregularities (e.g., Training 2 expected has repeating 6s on left, 3s with 8s/9s on right; generated mixes 7s, 1s, 3s randomly).
 * Dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1 is 12x16, Training 2 is 10x10, Training 3 9x14, Training 4 10x10), so code must handle arbitrary sizes without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Possible rotation or mirroring: Outputs don't match simple transposes, but some vertical alignment suggests row-wise processing or vertical propagation (e.g., Training 4 expected repeats 6s and 3s in blocks; generated has jagged 2s, 1s, 3s).
 * Easy to miss: Outputs aren't just copies or mirrors—some numbers change (e.g., Training 3 generated has 1s/4s where expected has 5s/3s/7s/8s/6s in clean bands), implying selection of min/max or mode per region.
 * All training examples show outputs with high repetition per row, hinting at smoothing or consensus rules across columns.
 * No evidence of object extraction yet, but grids may represent scenes with "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need isolation or transformation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs; do not use in future attempts as it ignores block formation.)

No other functions from attempts; no object extraction or blob detection implemented yet, which may be needed for identifying regions.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses only transposition, which works for reorienting but fails entirely to match any expected patterns, producing scattered numbers instead of uniform blocks (e.g., Training 1 generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s/3s/4s/9s per row, vs. expected clean 7/3/0 bands with right-side consistency).
 * Train 1 mismatches by scattering original numbers (e.g., generated row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected all 7s except right 3s; unknown why transpose preserves some but jumbles others into non-blocks).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob shapes and values (generated mixes 7s/8s/1s/3s/9s/5s/6s irregularly, e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,...] vs. expected [6,6,...,7,7]; doesn't form the vertical 6/3/8 bands).
 * Train 3 mismatches by introducing unrelated 1s/4s/5s/8s without banding (generated row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected [5,5,...,3,3,...]; row 3 has jagged 3/1/4/6/8 vs. expected 7/8/6/3/4 bands—unknown reason for value shifts).
 * Train 4 mismatches row repetitions and block edges (generated has varying 2/6/1/3 per row, e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,...] vs. expected all [6,6,...,2,2,2]; doesn't capture the alternating 6/3/2 bands).
 * No extraction of objects or regions attempted, missing core need to detect/ fill blobs (essential for future, as grids likely contain distinct shapes).
 * Transpose function is incorrect and not relevant (scrambles without insight; avoid in future).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears to be a direct (or near-direct) transpose of an unseen input grid, resulting in highly irregular rows with mixed numbers (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s; row 12 introduces 1s/0s scattered amid 9s/6s; later rows have 7s/4s/8s in non-uniform patterns like [9,9,7,7,...1,9,...]).
 * It lacks the uniform banding seen in all expected training outputs (e.g., no repeating identical rows or solid blocks of 6s/3s/9s/8s; instead, jagged edges and intrusions like single 1s or 0s disrupt potential regions, e.g., row 6 has [9,9,9,3,3,3,3,1,8,0,...] vs. what should likely be cleaner horizontal fills).
 * Doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it preserves input noise (scattered 0/1/2/3/8) without consolidation, suggesting no rule application—just mechanical swap; expected test should have structured bands (e.g., large 9/6 areas filled solidly, with transitions like training examples).
 * To handle test, future code must detect and expand dominant numbers per column/row, ignoring isolates; account for larger size (~30x30?) with varying blob densities.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids with numerical patterns (likely representing shapes, regions, or objects) are processed to produce output grids with reorganized or simplified patterns, often featuring uniform blocks of numbers, repeated rows, or extracted substructures. The goal appears to be identifying and reconstructing specific visual elements like blobs, lines, or filled areas while preserving certain symmetries or rules, but the exact transformation (e.g., extraction, mirroring, or filtering) remains unclear from failed attempts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids use numbers (0-9) to denote colors, fills, or object boundaries; uniform blocks (e.g., all 7s or 3s) in expected outputs suggest collapsing or highlighting connected regions rather than direct copying or simple swaps.
 * Expected outputs often have repeated identical rows (e.g., multiple rows of [7,7,7,...3,3,3,7,7,7] in Training 1), indicating vertical stacking or replication of horizontal patterns, which transposition ignores.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have scattered numbers (e.g., 1s as connectors or holes?), but outputs simplify to solid blocks, possibly filtering out noise or small objects.
 * Boundaries and edges matter; expected outputs trim or extend regions (e.g., Training 2 shifts 3s and 8s into aligned blocks, unlike scattered generated versions).
 * No rotation or full reversal seen; instead, partial reorganization, like promoting certain numbers (e.g., 3s expanding in Training 1) while demoting others (e.g., 0s or 1s disappearing).
 * Grids may represent layered objects (e.g., backgrounds of 9s or 6s with foreground patterns); outputs prioritize foreground or specific layers.
 * Easy to miss: Outputs maintain grid dimensions but alter content non-uniformly; e.g., Training 3 expected has stacked 5s and 3s, then mixed 7/8/6/4 blocks, suggesting object separation by value.
 * All examples show outputs with fewer variations per row than inputs, implying aggregation or rule-based filling (e.g., flood-fill connected components).
 * Consider object connectivity: Numbers like 6 or 9 might be backgrounds, while 3/0/1 form shapes that get extracted and repositioned.
 * No evidence of arithmetic operations; purely structural (e.g., copy-paste blocks with modifications).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transposes the input grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition; do not reuse without modification for object detection.)

No other helpful functions from attempts; future ones might need connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill for regions of same number) or pattern matching for blocks.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used simple transposition, which worked nowhere: it correctly swaps rows/columns but fails to reorganize into the blocky, repeated patterns in expected outputs.
 * Training 1 generated: Scattered 6s/7s/8s with misplaced 1s/0s/3s/9s/4s (e.g., row [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,1,7,8,8,8] vs. expected uniform [7s then 3s]); differs by not collapsing to solid blocks or repeating rows—unknown why 1s/0s appear as artifacts, but they disrupt uniformity.
 * Training 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/1s/3s/9s/5s/6s (e.g., row [7,7,7,8,8,1,1,1,8,8] vs. expected [6s then 7s]); differs in scattering small numbers (1s/5s/6s) instead of aligning 3/8/6/7 blocks—transposition mixes columns incorrectly without extracting shapes.
 * Training 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/1s/4s/8s/7s (e.g., row [6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,5,9,5,5,5] vs. expected stacked 5s/3s); differs by fragmenting regions (e.g., isolated 5s/9s) rather than creating vertical stacks or horizontal alignments—ignores object boundaries.
 * Training 4 generated: Disordered 2s/6s/1s/3s/4s (e.g., row [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected stacked 6s/3s/2s); differs by not replicating rows or prioritizing 6/3/2 blocks—small 1s act as noise not filtered out.
 * Transposition is broken for this puzzle: It preserves no visual semantics (e.g., doesn't handle connected regions or repetitions), leading to all mismatches; avoid in future as it's irrelevant.
 * No object extraction attempted, missing core need to identify blobs (e.g., groups of 3s) for repositioning.
 * All trainings mismatch in scale: Generated has more variation per row; expected simplifies to fewer distinct segments.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It appears as a partially transposed grid with scattered 9s/6s/3s/0s/1s/8s/2s/7s/4s, creating irregular patches (e.g., row [9,9,9,3,3,3,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,9,9,9] has abrupt shifts), unlike the uniform blocks/repetitions in training expecteds.
 * It fails to simplify: Dense 9s dominate but fragment into small 0/1/2 intrusions, suggesting no region aggregation—expected likely has cleaner layers (e.g., solid 9 backgrounds with extracted 6/3/2 shapes stacked).
 * Dimensions match (30 cols, ~27 rows?), but content is noisy; e.g., late rows introduce 7/4/1 without clear pattern, while expecteds avoid such scatter—does not account for filtering small objects or extending blocks.
 * Overall, resembles raw transposition artifacts (e.g., diagonal-like spreads of 0s/1s), not a valid puzzle solution; mentally, correct output should replicate training style with repeated uniform rows of dominant numbers (9/6 base, overlaid 3/2 patterns).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by integers like 0 for background, 1 for small blue markers, 3 for green, and higher numbers for large colored blocks), where the goal is to segment and expand regions into bounding boxes, prioritize filling by area, and reconstruct a simplified output grid by filling these expanded blocks while handling special cases for green (full-height strip) and zero (bottom-left block). The program attempts to identify and expand these regions based on proximity to blue markers but fails due to runtime errors, preventing any valid output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids may need transposition if height != width, suggesting inputs could be rotated or non-square.
 * Small blues (value 1) act as anchors for expanding nearby large blocks (colors >1 with count >20 and span >5), using bounding boxes that grow by 1 cell in all directions if a blue is inside.
 * Large blocks are detected via min/max row/col and count thresholds to filter noise; subtle: only non-0/1 colors qualify, and expansion is per-blue but applied once per block.
 * Green (3) requires special full-height vertical strip expansion to width 3 centered on average column, with minor proximity-based tweaks to blues within Chebyshev distance 2; easy to miss: fallback to dummy if no green, and overriding to full height regardless of original span.
 * Zero (0) regions get special bottom-left expansion to full remaining height and ~1/3 width, also with proximity to blues; subtle: uses average row for starting minr, but clamps to bottom; dummy if no zeros.
 * No merging of overlapping blocks; instead, fills in area-descending order, with remaining cells defaulting to the largest block's color.
 * Outputs must match input dimensions (possibly after transpose); subtle: all fills use max(0,min(H-1,...)) clamping to avoid index errors.
 * Potential for empty regions or no blues/large blocks, requiring dummies to avoid crashes.
 * Errors suggest index issues, likely from assuming non-empty bboxes or unpacking tuples incorrectly (e.g., green_block[3] instead of green_block[1][3]).

        expanded.append((c, (minr, minc, maxr, maxc)))
    return expanded
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first attempt; it structures the problem around detecting/expanding color blocks with blues as anchors, special-handling green/zero, and priority-filling, showing partial understanding of segmentation and expansion rules.
 * What worked: Functions like get_small_blue and get_large_blocks correctly identify blues and large regions without errors in isolation; bbox calculation and area-sorting for fill order are logical for prioritizing dominant blocks.
 * What didn't work: Runtime errors ("tuple index out of range") on all training examples 1-4 and test input, likely from accessing bbox tuples incorrectly (e.g., green_block[3] instead of green_block[1][3] when checking validity, or unpacking empty results); no valid outputs generated, so cannot assess logic accuracy.
 * Transposition logic (if H != W) is attempted but may contribute to errors if grids are empty or malformed.
 * expand_green and expand_zero have special overrides (full-height strip for green, bottom-left for zero) that seem puzzle-specific but are buggy (e.g., proximity loop doesn't accumulate expansions properly, and avg_c calculation assumes len>0).
 * merge_overlapping is a no-op (just returns as-is), which is simple but unhelpful for overlaps; fill order relies on sorting, but defaults to largest color for remnants—may overfill if blocks don't cover grid.
 * No handling for edge cases like no blues/large blocks (dummies used but validity check green_block[3][2] fails on tuple access); overall, code crashes before filling, so no observed effects beyond errors.
 * Function expand_blocks is somewhat helpful but too simplistic (expands only if blue inside original bbox, not proximity); expand_green/zero are attempt at subtleties but broken due to index errors and non-accumulating expansions.

**Test output:**
 * No valid test output generated; all attempts (this single one) result in "ERROR - Execution error: tuple index out of range", so it does not make sense or look correct—execution fails entirely, preventing any grid reconstruction.
 * Expected test output should be a filled grid with expanded blocks (e.g., large colors grown around blues, green as vertical strip, zero as bottom-left, remnants defaulted), but since code crashes on bbox access (likely in validity checks like if green_block[3][2] > ...), it produces nothing usable; difference is total failure vs. a potentially matching segmented grid.
 * Without running mentally (as grid not provided), errors indicate the program cannot handle the test input's structure (e.g., missing green/zero leading to invalid dummies or empty tuples), making it incorrect by default.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid processing where the goal is to identify and manipulate connected regions (blobs) of the same numerical value in a 2D grid, likely to simplify or reconstruct patterns such as filling bounding boxes or transforming shapes while preserving some structural rules, but the exact transformation rules (e.g., value mapping, region selection criteria, or output grid initialization) remain unclear from the failed attempts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are connected components of the same value, using 4-connectivity (up, down, left, right) via DFS or BFS, but only large regions (>=3 cells) are considered, ignoring noise/single cells or small groups.
 * The grid is transposed (rows become columns) before processing, which may be intended to rotate or reorient the puzzle for analysis, but this step appears to contribute to mismatches in orientation and positioning.
 * Regions are sorted by size (number of cells) in decreasing order, and their bounding boxes (min/max row/col) are filled with the region's value on a fresh zero-initialized grid; however, this overwrites smaller regions with larger ones, leading to loss of detail and incorrect value placements.
 * Expected outputs show clean, block-like patterns with specific values (e.g., large uniform areas of 7s, 3s, 0s in training 1; structured bands of 6s, 3s, 8s in training 2), suggesting the puzzle may involve value remapping, selective filling without full overwrites, or different connectivity (e.g., 8-connectivity including diagonals).
 * Subtle elements: Outputs must match exact positions and values without extraneous numbers (e.g., generated includes 1s, 4s, 9s where expected has 0s or 3s); zero areas in expectations indicate unfilled or background spaces; patterns suggest vertical/horizontal banding or shape extension, not just BBox filling.
 * Considerations across attempts: No rotation or mirroring beyond transpose; no handling of value-specific rules (e.g., some values like 0 or 1 might be treated as background); potential need to process original grid without transpose or combine multiple steps; small regions might actually be important in some cases despite the >=3 filter; overlapping BBoxes cause generated outputs to have irregular, non-blocky shapes unlike expectations.

    return output
```
(This filling logic is somewhat helpful for reconstructing from BBoxes but is flawed as it overwrites without preserving original details or handling overlaps correctly; consider modifying to avoid full overwrites or use union of regions.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed, indicating the core logic (transpose + extract large regions + size-ordered BBox fill on zero grid) does not capture the puzzle's transformation rules.
 * In training 1, generated a top-heavy grid with horizontal bands of 6s, 7s, 4s mixed with small 1s, 8s, 9s, but expected vertical bands of 7s transitioning to 3s and bottom 0s; the transpose likely rotated patterns incorrectly, and BBox filling created unwanted extensions (e.g., 6s where 7s expected), while ignoring small regions lost key separators.
 * In training 2, generated irregular shapes with 7s, 8s, 1s, 3s, 0s, 5s scattered (e.g., small 1s blobs and partial 8s bands), but expected clean horizontal bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, 9s with no small intrusions; size ordering overwrote smaller features like 1s incorrectly, and value mismatch (e.g., 7s instead of 6s) suggests no remapping.
 * In training 3, generated a jumbled mix of 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s, 8s, 5s, 9s with broken lines (e.g., interrupted 4s and 1s blobs), but expected structured rows of 5s/3s transitioning to 7/8/6/4 bands; BBox filling expanded regions too much (e.g., full rows of 6s where partial expected), and transpose misaligned vertical elements.
 * In training 4, generated overlapping 2s, 6s, 1s, 4s, 3s in non-block forms (e.g., diagonal-ish 1s and partial 6s), but expected repeating horizontal blocks of 6s, 3s, 2s; the approach captured some large blobs but failed to extend or clean them into uniform bands, with small 1s regions incorrectly preserved/included.
 * Transpose_grid is helpful but likely unnecessary or wrongly applied, as it consistently rotates patterns away from expected orientations.
 * extract_regions is essential and mostly correct for blob detection but misses subtleties like including smaller regions (<3 cells) or using 8-connectivity; the >=3 filter discards potentially important small features (e.g., 1s in trainings).
 * fill_large_regions is broken/not helpful as-is, because size-ordered overwriting creates artifacts (e.g., large BBoxes erase smaller ones entirely, leading to uniform blocks where mixed or zero areas expected); don't use without modifications like layering or selective filling.
 * Overall, no value remapping or background handling (e.g., propagating 0s), and no consideration for puzzle-specific rules like extending shapes to grid edges or ignoring certain values.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and appears chaotic/incoherent compared to the structured, blocky expectations from trainings; it has massive horizontal bands of 9s at top/bottom, vertical columns of 6s on the right, irregular intrusions of 3s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 4s, 7s, 8s scattered in the middle (e.g., small 1s/2s blobs amid 0s, partial 4s bands overwritten by 8s), creating a non-patterned mess rather than clean regions.
 * It over-relies on BBox filling, expanding large 9s and 6s to dominate while leaving noisy small regions (e.g., isolated 1s/2s where zeros or unified blocks might be expected), and the transpose likely misorients the input's vertical/horizontal features.
 * The output mismatches potential expected clean divisions (e.g., no full zero backgrounds or value shifts like 3-to-0 transitions seen in training 1), with unknown reasons for specific value appearances (e.g., why 4s and 7s emerge); it does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it lacks the banded, uniform structure of expectations—likely needs rules for non-overwriting fills, value substitution, or no transpose to handle the test case's wider grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual grid puzzle involving identifying connected regions (blobs) of the same numerical value in a 2D grid, likely representing colors or shapes, and then transforming the grid by expanding or filling these regions in a specific way to create larger uniform blocks or patterns, followed by a possible transposition of the grid. The goal appears to be reconstructing a "completed" or stylized version of the input where dominant regions are emphasized or extended, while smaller or isolated elements are handled differently, resulting in clean, blocky outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected regions are 4-connected (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), as implemented in the DFS, which seems correct for blob extraction but may miss nuances if regions have holes or irregular shapes.
 * Only "large" regions are processed (current code uses >=3 cells), but this threshold might be too low or incorrect—expected outputs suggest focusing on the largest or most prominent blobs per value, potentially ignoring small ones entirely (e.g., single cells or pairs), and possibly merging or extending them to form rectangular or strip-like blocks that align with grid edges.
 * Bounding box filling overfills areas, overwriting non-connected cells and causing overlaps (e.g., in training 1, it creates unwanted 6-filled rows and mixes 7s with 1s/4s/9s, instead of clean 7/3/0 strips); the puzzle likely requires filling only the minimal enclosing shape or expanding in specific directions (e.g., vertically/horizontally to edges) without overwriting other regions.
 * Sorting regions by size descending and filling largest first is a good idea for prioritization but fails due to bbox overreach; subtleties include handling overlapping bboxes (current code doesn't resolve conflicts) and preserving small regions or backgrounds (e.g., 0s in expected outputs).
 * Transposition (zip(*grid)) is applied at the end, which may be key for some orientations (e.g., turning row-based patterns into column-based), but in the examples, it leads to mismatches—perhaps it should be conditional or applied before/after filling.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16 in train 1, 10x10 in train 2, 9x14 in train 3, 10x10 in train 4, larger irregular in test), so code must handle dynamic dimensions; inputs may have sparse or irregular distributions, with values like 0 as background.
 * Expected outputs show clean, uniform horizontal/vertical bands or quadrants (e.g., train 1 has stacked rows of 7s, 3s, 0s; train 2 has mixed but blocky patterns; train 4 emphasizes 6s and 3s in blocks), suggesting the transformation "simplifies" the grid by promoting dominant colors to full rows/columns while demoting others.
 * Subtle elements: Possible color-specific rules (e.g., highest value dominates?); handling of isolated cells (e.g., 1s in train 1 expected as part of 3s or omitted); no diagonal connectivity; potential for regions to "grow" towards edges but not beyond other blobs; test input has many small scattered elements (1s, 2s, 4s, 7s), which may need ignoring or minimal filling.
 * All examples are transposed in output, but inputs aren't shown—assume input is pre-transposed or needs it to match orientation.
 * Avoid filling entire bboxes if regions aren't rectangular; perhaps compute filled rectangles only if the region spans fully in one dimension.

                    output[rr][cc] = region.value
    return output
```
(This function is broken/not helpful as-is because full bbox filling causes overlaps and incorrect expansions (e.g., turns irregular blobs into rectangles that overwrite everything); don't use in future—replace with targeted filling, e.g., only fill positions within the region or extend to edges without overwriting.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All four training examples failed, with generated outputs showing overfilled bounding boxes that create unwanted uniform strips or mixed regions (e.g., train 1 generated top-heavy 6s/7s with scattered 1s/4s/9s/8s, differing from expected stacked 7/3/0 bands; train 2 generated irregular 7/8/1/3/0/5 blocks, missing expected 6/3/8/7/9 structure; train 3 generated fragmented 6/1/4/3/8/5/9, unlike expected clean 5/3/7/8/6/4 rows; train 4 generated scattered 2/6/1/4/3, not matching expected 6/3/2 blocks).
 * Connected component extraction via DFS worked for identifying blobs (e.g., correctly groups same-value cells), but filtering >=3 cells may include too many small regions, leading to noise.
 * Sorting by size and filling largest first is a partial win for prioritizing dominant blobs but fails due to bbox overfill, which ignores region shape and causes cascading overwrites (e.g., large 9s in test overwrite everything into messy patterns).
 * Transposition is applied but mismatches orientations—e.g., in train 1, it produces horizontal strips that don't align with expected vertical-ish bands (unknown if input needs pre-transpose).
 * No handling for color dominance or background preservation (e.g., 0s in train 1 expected at bottom, but generated as partial fills); small elements like isolated 1s are incorrectly incorporated.
 * extract_regions is essential and mostly correct (keep/modify threshold); GridRegion class is useful for bbox but needs better filling logic.
 * fill_large_regions is incorrect and not relevant (overfills; avoid in future).
 * Missed subtlety of expanding to grid edges without overlaps (e.g., train 4 expected 6s/3s/2s as full blocks, but generated keeps small 1s/4s).
 * Train 2 mismatches blob merging for unknown reason (e.g., 1s and 3s not combined into expected 8/6/9 areas).
 * Train 3 has bbox filling that fragments middle rows (1s/4s mixed), differing from expected unified 3/6/4 bands.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a chaotic overfill of 9s dominating edges and large areas, with scattered small blobs of 3/0/1/2/8/6/4/7 not forming clean blocks, unlike the uniform band/quadrant patterns in expected trainings (e.g., excessive 9s fill almost entire rows/columns, overwriting potential structures like the small 1s/2s/4s/7s into irregular patches; 6s form a vertical strip but are interrupted, and 8s/4s create mismatched bottom blocks).
 * It fails to simplify into large uniform regions (e.g., no clear stacking like train 1's 7/3/0), instead amplifying bbox errors on the large input (30 cols, ~30 rows?) with many small scattered elements, resulting in a "smeared" grid rather than a stylized completion.
 * Likely incorrect because it doesn't demote small regions (e.g., isolated 1s/2s should be absorbed or omitted, not bbox-filled into lines); to handle test, need rules for ignoring < certain size, resolving overlaps by priority (e.g., value-based), and possibly row/column-wise dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving grid-based "blobs" or connected regions of identical numbers (likely representing colored or labeled areas), where the task is to identify these regions, expand or fill them into rectangular bounding boxes without overwriting in unintended ways, and then transform the grid (possibly via transpose or rotation) to match a reorganized output pattern. The input grids contain numbers like 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (possibly with 1 as background or separator), and the output rearranges these into solid blocks or expanded shapes that align with expected patterns, often shifting or reorienting regions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions are connected components of the same number, but connectivity matters: the current 8-directional DFS captures diagonal connections, which may over-merge regions (e.g., in Training 1, this likely caused 6's and 7's to blob together incorrectly instead of separating into distinct horizontal/vertical bands).
 * Background or empty cells: The code skips cells with value 1, treating it as non-region, but expected outputs include 0's as filled areas (e.g., Training 1 has 0's in a band), suggesting 0 might be a valid region value or a default fill, while 1 could be ignored or treated differently; do not assume 1 is the only skip—test for 0 as a fillable region.
 * Filling mechanism: Regions are expanded to axis-aligned bounding boxes (bbox), but sorting by size descending and overwriting smaller bboxes with larger ones leads to loss of detail (e.g., in Training 1, smaller 3's and 0's are overwritten by 7's; in Training 2, 3's and 8's bleed into each other).
 * Overlaps and order: Larger regions should not completely overwrite smaller ones; perhaps fill without overwriting (e.g., only fill unvisited cells) or process in a different order (e.g., by value or position). Subtle: bbox filling ignores the original shape, turning irregular blobs into rectangles, which works for some straight bands but fails for L-shapes or protrusions (e.g., Training 3 has irregular 3's and 6's that expected output straightens differently).
 * Grid transformation: Transposing (zip(*grid)) at the end rotates the grid 90 degrees counterclockwise, but expected outputs suggest a different reorientation—possibly mirroring, rotating 180, or no transpose, as patterns in Training 1/4 shift vertically/horizontally rather than purely transposing (e.g., Training 4 expected has vertical 6's becoming horizontal, but generated keeps some vertical artifacts).
 * Region validation: Only regions with len(positions) >=1 are kept, but single cells might need special handling; also, 0 might represent "empty" that gets filled by adjacent regions or left as-is.
 * Edge cases: Grids vary in size (e.g., Training 1 is 12x16, Training 2 is 10x10), so ensure bbox clipping to grid bounds; disconnected same-value regions are treated separately (good), but merging across diagonals is a subtlety to avoid.
 * Overall goal: Outputs show "solidified" blocks where original scattered same-value cells form uniform rectangles, often with bands stacking in a new orientation, suggesting the puzzle is about "rectangularizing" and reordering regions by size, value, or position.

    output = [[0] * w for _ in range(h)]  # Initializes to 0; good if 0 is background fill
    for region in all_regions:
        min_r, max_r, min_c, max_c = region.bbox
        for rr in range(max(0, min_r), min(h, max_r + 1)):
            for cc in range(max(0, min_c), min(w, max_c + 1)):
                output[rr][cc] = region.value  # Overwrites everything in bbox; change to only unvisited/original positions to avoid bleed
    return output
```
(This is partially helpful for bbox expansion but unhelpful in current form due to aggressive overwriting; modify to fill only region positions or non-overlapping areas.)

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]
```
(This is helpful as a transformation tool but likely incorrect for the puzzle—expected outputs suggest no transpose or a different rotation/mirror; test without it or use 180-degree rotate.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single program attempt used 8-connected DFS, which over-merged diagonally adjacent cells (e.g., in Training 1, caused 6's to expand into areas that should be 7's or 0's, generating mismatched horizontal bands of 6/7 instead of vertical 7/3/0 stacks).
 * Sorting regions by size descending and filling bboxes led to larger regions (e.g., 7's in Training 1) overwriting smaller ones (3's and 0's), resulting in loss of distinct bands; expected outputs preserve separate rectangular blocks without bleed.
 * Skipping only value==1 in extraction ignored potential 0 regions, leading to unfilled areas (e.g., Training 1 generated has stray 0's where expected has solid 0 bands).
 * Transpose at the end rotated patterns incorrectly: Training 1 generated has horizontal 6/7 rows that don't match expected vertical stacks; Training 4 generated keeps some vertical 2/6 but scrambles them, while expected reorients to horizontal 6/2 with vertical 3's.
 * In Training 2, over-merging created irregular 7/8/3 shapes (e.g., generated has 7's intruding into 3's), differing from expected clean horizontal bands of 6/3/8/9/7; unknown why 0 and 5/9 got misplaced, but likely bbox overwrite.
 * Training 3: 8-connectivity merged 3's and 6's diagonally, generating scattered 4/6/8 with 5/9 intrusions, vs. expected solid top 5/3 bands and vertical 7/8/6/4; bbox filling ignored original protrusions (e.g., single 7's not expanded properly).
 * Training 4: Simple bands were partially captured (e.g., some 6/2/3 rectangles), but transpose and overwrite scrambled order—generated has vertical 3's at bottom but misplaced 0/2, vs. expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; closer but still mismatched orientation.
 * Overall, extract_regions is essential for blob detection but needs 4-connectivity fix; fill_regions is broken due to overwrite (don't use as-is); transpose is not relevant or wrong for reorientation (test alternatives like no transform).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct and follows the same flaws as training: excessive overwriting (e.g., 9's dominate left/right columns, bleeding into 3/6/0/2/8/4 areas, creating solid 9 walls where expected likely has distinct bands); 8-connectivity likely merged large 9/6/8 blobs diagonally, ignoring separations (e.g., row 13 has stray 0 in 9's, suggesting partial non-overwrite but inconsistent). It has irregular shapes like a single 8 in row 7 and scattered 2's/4's/7's at bottom, vs. what should be clean rectangular blocks (e.g., vertical 3's on left, horizontal 6's in middle, bottom 4/8 bands)—patterns don't align into expected stacked rectangles, and transpose likely misorients the large 9 regions. Missing solid fills for 0 (appears as holes) and 2/7/4 (scattered vs. banded); does not make sense as a puzzle solution, as it looks noisy/overmerged rather than organized.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers (likely representing colors or pixel values in a diagram), where the goal is to apply a sequence of transformations to clean up irregularities, resolve overlaps, standardize shapes, and possibly reorient the grid to match expected outputs that appear to depict structured patterns like layered shapes, bases, or objects with specific color distributions.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are represented as List[List[int]], with rows as outer lists and columns as inner; dimensions vary (e.g., train1 seems ~12x16, train2 ~10x10, train3 ~9x14, train4 ~10x10), and outputs must preserve or adjust to match expected row counts and widths exactly.
 * Small "blue components" (value 1) need handling, possibly by replacement with surrounding or columnar context, but not blanket replacement as it over-simplifies sparse elements.
 * Overlapping bounding boxes suggest layered or merged shapes; resolution likely involves priority rules (e.g., max value, dominance by larger blobs) rather than simple max per row, and the placeholder implementation flattens incorrectly.
 * Base formation implies standardizing lower rows (e.g., filling bottoms with a uniform or modal value if height >=3), but must respect existing structure without overwriting everything above.
 * Shape irregularity handling aims to regularize sparse or jagged columns by filling with modes or interpolating, but applying full-column fills creates uniform blocks that erase details like gradients or protrusions.
 * Transposition (zip(*g)) rotates the grid 90 degrees, which may be needed for reorientation but is misplaced at the end, leading to vertical single-column outputs instead of horizontal rows.
 * Expected outputs show patterns like uniform top sections, irregular middles with specific color blobs (e.g., 3's in bases, 7's in bodies), and sparse bottoms (0's), suggesting object extraction, segmentation, or morphological operations (e.g., filling holes, connecting components) rather than pure statistical modes.
 * Subtle elements: Preserve 0's as empty space; handle multi-color blobs (e.g., 3,6,7,8,9 mixing); account for asymmetric shapes (e.g., train2 has diagonal shifts); avoid over-regularization that turns complex patterns into solids; consider vertical vs. horizontal dominance in modes; grids may represent 2D images of 3D-like puzzles (e.g., stacked blocks with bases).
 * All transformations must chain correctly without dimension loss; outputs are printed as row lists, so final format must be wide rows, not tall columns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def get_column_modes(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    rows = len(g)
    if rows == 0:
        return []
    cols = len(g[0])
    modes = []
    for c in range(cols):
        col_values = [g[r][c] for r in range(rows)]
        counter = Counter(col_values)
        mode = counter.most_common(1)[0][0]
        modes.append(mode)
    return modes
```
(This computes per-column most common values, useful for regularization but needs refinement to avoid ignoring minorities or 0's.)

```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(Useful for reorientation if the puzzle requires rotating the final grid, but timing and necessity depend on input orientation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used a pipeline of handle_small_blue_components (replaces 1's with column modes: worked conceptually for filling gaps but over-applied, turning sparse blues into dominant colors prematurely).
 * handle_overlapping_bboxes was broken (simplified to max per row or identity, causing flattening/loss of vertical structure; not helpful—avoid in future as it doesn't resolve true overlaps like stacked blobs).
 * handle_base_formation incorrectly approximated bottom mode and overwrote only last 3 rows without checking content, leading to mismatched bases (e.g., train1 expected mixed 0/3/7 bottoms but got uniform 7's).
 * handle_shape_irregularity filled entire grid with column modes, which erased all variation (unhelpful for preserving shapes; too aggressive—don't reuse as-is).
 * Final transpose turned wide grids into 1-wide tall ones, mismatching all expected wide-row formats (core issue: dimensions inverted, e.g., train1 generated 16x1 vs. expected ~12x16).
 * Train1: Generated uniform vertical [7]/[9]/[8] stacks; differed from expected by lacking horizontal structure, wrong row count (16 vs. 12), no 0/3 bases, and over-filled top with 7's instead of mixed 7/3.
 * Train2: Generated vertical [7]/[8]/[9]; differed by single-column format, wrong heights (e.g., 10x1 vs. 10x10), ignored diagonal 8/9 shifts and base 3's, resulting in no pattern match.
 * Train3: Generated vertical [6]/[5]/[9]; differed by 1-wide vs. 9x14, lost middle layer details (e.g., expected 7/8/6 mixes became uniform), and mismatched bottom 4's with 5/9.
 * Train4: Generated irregular vertical [3]/[6]/[4]; differed by 1-wide vs. 10x10, partial mode filling caught some 6/3 but scrambled order/heights, missing uniform top 6's and base 2's.
 * Overall: No training samples passed; attempt showed partial understanding of modes/bases but failed on chaining, dimensions, and subtlety (e.g., didn't extract or segment objects like blobs of 3's or 8's).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is 30 rows of single-element [9], creating a uniform vertical tower of 9's, which does not look correct—it ignores any input structure, over-applies modes (assuming 9 dominates), and inverts dimensions to 30x1 (likely from a wider input post-transpose).
 * This fails to match puzzle patterns seen in training (e.g., no bases, mixes, or 0's); it suggests the pipeline homogenized everything to one color without preserving shapes, making it nonsensical for a visual puzzle expecting layered or irregular outputs.
 * To handle test, must avoid full-grid filling, fix transpose placement/dimensions, and incorporate object detection (e.g., connected components for blobs) to retain details like sparse elements or overlaps.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all 4 training examples, the following are the only obvious, consistent interactions or connections observed across **every** input-output pair. These are limited to properties or components that appear in all examples and show clear, repeatable effects or dependencies (e.g., presence, adjacency, or transformation influence). Irrelevant or inconsistent elements (e.g., Orange, which appears in only 2/4 inputs and transforms differently each time; Yellow, which is absent in 1/4 and transforms inconsistently; Maroon/Dark Red/Red, which vary in presence and effect) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution or full transformation rules are inferred—only direct, consistent links are noted. Where a connection's mechanism cannot be explained from the data (e.g., exact how/why of a change), it is marked as unknown.

- **Blue shapes → Green regions (positional adjacency influences size/position transformation)**:  
  Blue components (small bars or clusters, always holes=0, low pixels=1-4) are consistently present in every input (multiple instances, total pixels 10-20 across examples) and positioned adjacent to or overlapping Green regions (horizontally/vertically within 1-2 units in bbox coordinates). In every output, this results in a transformed Green region (single prominent Green with holes=0, bbox expanded or shifted, pixels 21-66). The adjacency is consistent (Blues never isolated from Green), but the exact transformation mechanism (e.g., why bbox expands left/right in some cases) is unknown.

- **Blue shapes → Pink regions (positional embedding influences merging or color preservation)**:  
  Blue components are consistently embedded within or directly adjacent to Pink regions in every input (Blues inside Pink bboxes or sharing edges). Every output preserves a Pink region (holes=0, pixels 21-39, bbox often similar but expanded horizontally). The embedding link is consistent (no input Pink without nearby Blue), suggesting Blue position affects Pink boundary adjustment, but the precise rule for pixel increase or bbox shift is unknown.

- **Green regions ↔ Pink regions (spatial overlap or adjacency drives mutual transformation)**:  
  In every input, Green and Pink regions are consistently adjacent or overlapping in bbox (e.g., shared x/y ranges within 1-3 units, no full separation). Every output shows both colors preserved but with altered bboxes that reflect the input overlap (e.g., Green's expansion encroaching on Pink's original space, or vice versa). This mutual spatial dependency is consistent across all examples, but the direction/mechanism of boundary resolution (e.g., which color "wins" pixels) is unknown.

- **Pixel count (area) of Blue → overall output consolidation**:  
  Total pixels of all Blue shapes in inputs (consistent range 10-20) correlates with output having fewer but larger components (3-6 regions total, each >20 pixels). This suggests Blue pixel density acts as a "consolidation trigger" for merging adjacent colors (Green/Pink), observed in every example, but the scaling formula (e.g., how Blue pixels map to output size increase) is unknown.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., holes are always 0 in trains, so no hole-based effects; no consistent color-to-color swaps like Yellow→Green; no reliable position-to-color changes across all). Test inputs follow similar patterns (e.g., Blues adjacent to Green/Pink), but cannot confirm outputs without data.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10
