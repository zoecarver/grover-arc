=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 15:20:47] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 15:23:58] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import queue

def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)

def group_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(g)
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    # Transpose to get new grid structure
    transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]
    # For simplicity, return the transposed grid
    # This is a starting point; in a full implementation, we would fill based on groups
    return transposed
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...

 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:24:17] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the max key (may need adjustment for puzzle ties).
    Helpful for identifying dominant values in columns, but insufficient alone—needs integration with filling logic.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

```python
def group_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    """
    Groups consecutive columns by their mode, returning list of (mode, width) tuples.
    Useful for detecting vertical strips of similar columns (e.g., in training 1, might group cols with mode 7).
    However, broken for the puzzle as it doesn't handle row-wise filling or horizontal blocks in expected outputs—don't use as core logic without major changes.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups
```

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

[2025-10-03 15:24:17] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:28:58] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected regions) that must be transformed according to specific pattern-based rules, producing output grids with large uniform blocks or stripes of numbers, often filling or outlining detected structures like blobs or lines. The goal is to recognize and manipulate connected components or regions in the input to match structured, repetitive expected outputs, rather than simple operations like transposition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain scattered numbers (0-9) forming irregular patterns or "blobs" of connected same-valued cells (likely 4-connected or 8-connected), and the output reinterprets these into horizontal bands or blocks of uniform values, suggesting rules for grouping, filling, or mirroring regions.
 * Outputs often feature repeating rows of the same pattern (e.g., entire rows of 7s with a small block of 3s in specific columns), indicating vertical symmetry or replication across rows, but with transitions between block types (e.g., from 7s to 3s to 0s) based on input structure.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have jagged edges or isolated cells (e.g., single 1s or small clusters), but outputs simplify them into clean rectangular blocks, possibly by expanding, contracting, or selecting dominant values per "layer" or section.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so rules must be size-agnostic; outputs preserve dimensions but reorganize content.
 * Connected components seem key: inputs show clusters (e.g., 3s forming shapes), outputs map them to filled regions (e.g., all 3s become a horizontal stripe across multiple rows).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the max key (may need adjustment for puzzle ties).
    Helpful for identifying dominant values in columns, but insufficient alone—needs integration with filling logic.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

```python
def group_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    """
    Groups consecutive columns by their mode, returning list of (mode, width) tuples.
    Useful for detecting vertical strips of similar columns (e.g., in training 1, might group cols with mode 7).
    However, broken for the puzzle as it doesn't handle row-wise filling or horizontal blocks in expected outputs—don't use as core logic without major changes.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups
```

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:33:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where scattered or patterned numbers in an input grid are resolved into structured blocks or bands of uniform values, likely based on dominance, frequency, or regional grouping rules rather than global uniform filling. The goal appears to be creating clean, horizontal or block-like patterns that preserve some aspects of the original structure, such as partial extensions or transitions between values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The transformation seems to involve identifying horizontal bands or rows/sections where a dominant value (possibly mode or majority) fills most of the space, but with subtle extensions or overrides in specific columns (e.g., in training example 1, 7s extend into the right side of 3 and 0 blocks, and 3s appear in a middle band with partial 7s).
 * Not all rows become fully uniform; instead, patterns show vertical consistency in columns while allowing horizontal segmentation (e.g., training example 2 has repeating rows with mixed blocks like 6s transitioning to 7s or 9s in specific positions, not full-row fills).
 * Ties in frequency or modes may favor certain values (e.g., maximum value in ties, as attempted), but the rule isn't purely row/column mode— it might require regional analysis, like connected components or blobs of similar values.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs often repeat the same row pattern multiple times vertically (e.g., 4 identical rows of a pattern in example 1), suggesting vertical stacking or propagation of horizontal decisions; transitions between blocks aren't abrupt but can have overlaps (e.g., example 3 has mixed values in middle rows before uniform 6s and 4s).
 * Potential for "scattered patterns" to simplify into "clean horizontal bands," but not via simple transpose-and-fill, as that loses positional details like the 3s interrupting 7s in example 1.
 * No evidence of rotation, mirroring, or non-numeric operations; focus on integer values (0-9) and their grouping.
 * Easy to miss: The output preserves some original positional relationships (e.g., right-side columns in example 1 keep 7s across changing bands), and not everything is filled uniformly—minority values can dominate in sub-regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for analyzing columns if the rule involves vertical dominance, but over-reliance leads to errors as seen.)

```python
def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This handles frequency-based decisions with tie-breaking, which aligns with potential dominance rules, but needs adaptation for regions, not full rows/columns.)

```python
def fill_row_with_mode(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fills a row with its computed mode value.
    Handles the transformation rule of uniform filling based on row dominance.
    """
    mode = compute_mode(row)
    return [mode for _ in row]
```
(This simplifies patterns to uniforms, which partially captures "clean bands" but fails on partial fills and positional preservation; not sufficient alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used transpose then mode-fill on transposed rows, creating fully uniform horizontal bands in the output (e.g., entire rows of 6s, 7s, 4s in training 1), which worked for simplifying scattered values into blocks but failed to preserve mixed patterns like the 3s interrupting 7s or the right-side 7 extensions in training example 1.
 * In training example 1, generated all-6s (top), all-7s (middle), all-4s (bottom) blocks, but expected has vertical repetition of mixed rows (e.g., 7s with partial 3s and 7s on right, then 3s with 7s on right, then 0s with 3s and 7s), so it over-uniformized and ignored column-specific propagations.
 * Training example 2 generated stacked uniform rows (8s, 3s, 7s, etc.), but expected has repeating mixed blocks (e.g., 6s transitioning to 7s on right, with 8s and 9s in middle sections), missing horizontal segmentation and vertical consistency in sub-columns.
 * Training example 3 generated uniform 6s and 4s blocks with a single 1s row, but expected has top uniform 5s/3s bands transitioning to mixed middle rows (7/8/6/3/6/4 patterns) before uniform bottoms, so it collapsed diverse middle rows incorrectly.
 * Training example 4 generated scattered uniform rows (6s, 4s, 1s, 3s), but expected has repeating 6/2 and 3/2 blocks vertically, indicating failure to group and propagate patterns across multiple rows.
 * Transpose was helpful for column analysis but combined with full-row fill made outputs too simplistic, losing regional details; compute_mode is relevant for dominance but needs per-segment application, not whole rows.
 * No object extraction functions were used or proposed, but the puzzle might benefit from identifying "blobs" or connected regions of values (unexplored so far); fill_row_with_mode is partially helpful for uniform bands but broken for mixed rows—don't use it without segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it consists of fully uniform long rows (30 elements each) of single values (9s, 6s, 0s, 2s, 4s) stacked vertically into large blocks, which mirrors the over-simplification seen in training examples and ignores likely mixed or segmented patterns.
 * It generates a top row of all 9s (unusual, as inputs probably don't have such dominance), then blocks of 6s (3 rows), 0s (4 rows), 9s (4 rows), 0s (1 row), 9s (1 row), 2s (8 rows), 9s (4 rows), 4s (4 rows), suggesting the transpose-mode-fill blindly propagated column modes without considering horizontal variations or regional rules.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected outputs from training show repeated but mixed rows (e.g., partial fills in columns), not monolithic blocks; it likely mismatches by not handling transitions or sub-regions, making the output too uniform and grid-filling without subtlety.

[2025-10-03 15:33:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected regions) that must be transformed according to specific pattern-based rules, producing output grids with large uniform blocks or stripes of numbers, often filling or outlining detected structures like blobs or lines. The goal is to recognize and manipulate connected components or regions in the input to match structured, repetitive expected outputs, rather than simple operations like transposition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain scattered numbers (0-9) forming irregular patterns or "blobs" of connected same-valued cells (likely 4-connected or 8-connected), and the output reinterprets these into horizontal bands or blocks of uniform values, suggesting rules for grouping, filling, or mirroring regions.
 * Outputs often feature repeating rows of the same pattern (e.g., entire rows of 7s with a small block of 3s in specific columns), indicating vertical symmetry or replication across rows, but with transitions between block types (e.g., from 7s to 3s to 0s) based on input structure.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have jagged edges or isolated cells (e.g., single 1s or small clusters), but outputs simplify them into clean rectangular blocks, possibly by expanding, contracting, or selecting dominant values per "layer" or section.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so rules must be size-agnostic; outputs preserve dimensions but reorganize content.
 * Connected components seem key: inputs show clusters (e.g., 3s forming shapes), outputs map them to filled regions (e.g., all 3s become a horizontal stripe across multiple rows).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the max key (may need adjustment for puzzle ties).
    Helpful for identifying dominant values in columns, but insufficient alone—needs integration with filling logic.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

```python
def group_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    """
    Groups consecutive columns by their mode, returning list of (mode, width) tuples.
    Useful for detecting vertical strips of similar columns (e.g., in training 1, might group cols with mode 7).
    However, broken for the puzzle as it doesn't handle row-wise filling or horizontal blocks in expected outputs—don't use as core logic without major changes.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups
```

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where scattered or patterned numbers in an input grid are resolved into structured blocks or bands of uniform values, likely based on dominance, frequency, or regional grouping rules rather than global uniform filling. The goal appears to be creating clean, horizontal or block-like patterns that preserve some aspects of the original structure, such as partial extensions or transitions between values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The transformation seems to involve identifying horizontal bands or rows/sections where a dominant value (possibly mode or majority) fills most of the space, but with subtle extensions or overrides in specific columns (e.g., in training example 1, 7s extend into the right side of 3 and 0 blocks, and 3s appear in a middle band with partial 7s).
 * Not all rows become fully uniform; instead, patterns show vertical consistency in columns while allowing horizontal segmentation (e.g., training example 2 has repeating rows with mixed blocks like 6s transitioning to 7s or 9s in specific positions, not full-row fills).
 * Ties in frequency or modes may favor certain values (e.g., maximum value in ties, as attempted), but the rule isn't purely row/column mode— it might require regional analysis, like connected components or blobs of similar values.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs often repeat the same row pattern multiple times vertically (e.g., 4 identical rows of a pattern in example 1), suggesting vertical stacking or propagation of horizontal decisions; transitions between blocks aren't abrupt but can have overlaps (e.g., example 3 has mixed values in middle rows before uniform 6s and 4s).
 * Potential for "scattered patterns" to simplify into "clean horizontal bands," but not via simple transpose-and-fill, as that loses positional details like the 3s interrupting 7s in example 1.
 * No evidence of rotation, mirroring, or non-numeric operations; focus on integer values (0-9) and their grouping.
 * Easy to miss: The output preserves some original positional relationships (e.g., right-side columns in example 1 keep 7s across changing bands), and not everything is filled uniformly—minority values can dominate in sub-regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for analyzing columns if the rule involves vertical dominance, but over-reliance leads to errors as seen.)

```python
def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This handles frequency-based decisions with tie-breaking, which aligns with potential dominance rules, but needs adaptation for regions, not full rows/columns.)

```python
def fill_row_with_mode(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fills a row with its computed mode value.
    Handles the transformation rule of uniform filling based on row dominance.
    """
    mode = compute_mode(row)
    return [mode for _ in row]
```
(This simplifies patterns to uniforms, which partially captures "clean bands" but fails on partial fills and positional preservation; not sufficient alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used transpose then mode-fill on transposed rows, creating fully uniform horizontal bands in the output (e.g., entire rows of 6s, 7s, 4s in training 1), which worked for simplifying scattered values into blocks but failed to preserve mixed patterns like the 3s interrupting 7s or the right-side 7 extensions in training example 1.
 * In training example 1, generated all-6s (top), all-7s (middle), all-4s (bottom) blocks, but expected has vertical repetition of mixed rows (e.g., 7s with partial 3s and 7s on right, then 3s with 7s on right, then 0s with 3s and 7s), so it over-uniformized and ignored column-specific propagations.
 * Training example 2 generated stacked uniform rows (8s, 3s, 7s, etc.), but expected has repeating mixed blocks (e.g., 6s transitioning to 7s on right, with 8s and 9s in middle sections), missing horizontal segmentation and vertical consistency in sub-columns.
 * Training example 3 generated uniform 6s and 4s blocks with a single 1s row, but expected has top uniform 5s/3s bands transitioning to mixed middle rows (7/8/6/3/6/4 patterns) before uniform bottoms, so it collapsed diverse middle rows incorrectly.
 * Training example 4 generated scattered uniform rows (6s, 4s, 1s, 3s), but expected has repeating 6/2 and 3/2 blocks vertically, indicating failure to group and propagate patterns across multiple rows.
 * Transpose was helpful for column analysis but combined with full-row fill made outputs too simplistic, losing regional details; compute_mode is relevant for dominance but needs per-segment application, not whole rows.
 * No object extraction functions were used or proposed, but the puzzle might benefit from identifying "blobs" or connected regions of values (unexplored so far); fill_row_with_mode is partially helpful for uniform bands but broken for mixed rows—don't use it without segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it consists of fully uniform long rows (30 elements each) of single values (9s, 6s, 0s, 2s, 4s) stacked vertically into large blocks, which mirrors the over-simplification seen in training examples and ignores likely mixed or segmented patterns.
 * It generates a top row of all 9s (unusual, as inputs probably don't have such dominance), then blocks of 6s (3 rows), 0s (4 rows), 9s (4 rows), 0s (1 row), 9s (1 row), 2s (8 rows), 9s (4 rows), 4s (4 rows), suggesting the transpose-mode-fill blindly propagated column modes without considering horizontal variations or regional rules.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected outputs from training show repeated but mixed rows (e.g., partial fills in columns), not monolithic blocks; it likely mismatches by not handling transitions or sub-regions, making the output too uniform and grid-filling without subtlety.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:37:52] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers that appear to represent noisy images or patterns (e.g., blocky shapes or regions of uniform values like letters, numbers, or symbols), where the task is to apply transformations to denoise or clean the input grid, revealing coherent, structured blocks of identical values as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The inputs are noisy versions of structured grids with rectangular or block-like regions of the same number (e.g., large uniform areas separated by boundaries), and the goal is to propagate dominant values across regions while suppressing outliers or noise without over-smoothing across distinct boundaries.
 * Expected outputs preserve sharp edges between different regions (e.g., horizontal/vertical lines of transition) and expand or fill uniform blocks consistently across rows/columns, often resulting in symmetric or repeating patterns like stacked rectangles.
 * Subtle elements include handling edges/corners differently (e.g., fewer neighbors), resolving ties in mode by favoring maximum values, and avoiding bleed-over between adjacent but distinct regions (e.g., a single outlier shouldn't propagate to dominate a whole block).
 * Transposition is used to reorient vertical structures horizontally for processing, but over-application of smoothing can blur boundaries or incorrectly fill regions (e.g., turning isolated noise into false extensions).
 * Patterns often involve decreasing or increasing value gradients vertically/horizontally, with some regions "growing" downward or rightward in the expectations.
 * Noise includes scattered single values or small clusters that should be overwritten by surrounding majorities, but smoothing must be directional or iterative to match exact block shapes.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 10x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; empty or zero values may represent backgrounds that should expand but not override foregrounds.
 * Iterative smoothing (multiple passes) might be needed for propagation, but single passes as in the attempt cause incomplete fills.
 * No rotation or scaling is evident; focus on local neighborhood consensus (e.g., 3x3 or linear neighbors) to build larger structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    if not lst:
        return 0
    count = Counter(lst)
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This function is useful for local consensus but needs better tie-breaking or weighting for boundaries.)

```python

    if not row:
        return []
    n = len(row)
    smoothed = row[:]
    for i in range(n):
        neighbors = [row[i]]
        if i > 0:
            neighbors.append(row[i - 1])
        if i < n - 1:
            neighbors.append(row[i + 1])
        smoothed[i] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return smoothed
```
(This is helpful for 1D denoising but insufficient alone; extend to 2D neighborhoods for better block preservation.)

```python
def smooth_grid_vertical(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Smooths each column vertically by treating columns as rows and applying smooth_row.
    This rule handles vertical noise reduction, complementing horizontal smoothing.

    n_rows = len(g)
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    smoothed = [row[:] for row in g]
    for j in range(n_cols):
        col = [g[i][j] for i in range(n_rows)]
        smoothed_col = smooth_row(col)
        for i in range(n_rows):
            smoothed[i][j] = smoothed_col[i]
    return smoothed
```
(This complements row smoothing but causes over-smoothing in vertical directions, blurring expected sharp horizontal bands.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Transposes the grid, swapping rows and columns.
    This core transformation reorients the input to align vertical structures horizontally.
    """
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is potentially useful for handling asymmetric noise but in the attempt, applying it once before smoothing misaligns structures, leading to incorrect propagation.)

(No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; future attempts might need flood-fill or region-growing to identify and clean blocks explicitly, as simple neighbor mode doesn't capture connected components well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used transposition followed by horizontal row smoothing and then vertical column smoothing, aiming for noise reduction via local modes, but this over-smoothed and incorrectly propagated values across boundaries, failing to produce the blocky, uniform regions in expectations.
 * In Training 1, generated output created uniform top bands of 6/7/8 and bottom bands of 4/7/8 with scattered 9s, but expected clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0 with sharp vertical offsets (e.g., columns 11-13 as 3s, rest 7s in top; full 3s in middle; 0/3 in bottom)—the smoothing filled too much horizontally after transpose, ignoring vertical block integrity.
 * In Training 2, generated irregular bands of 7/8/3/5/9 with jagged edges (e.g., row 4 has 7s then 3s; row 9 has mixed 3/6), but expected structured blocks like top 6s, middle 3/8/6 bands, and bottom 3/8/9/7—transpose + smoothing created false vertical fills (e.g., 9s appearing where 6s should dominate).
 * In Training 3, generated mixed 6/4/3/8/5/9 with incomplete blocks (e.g., row 1 all 6/9; row 4 has 6/4/8), but expected top 5/3 bands, middle 7/8/6/3/6/4—smoothing failed to expand 3s leftward or align vertical columns properly, leaving noise like isolated 5s.
 * In Training 4, generated descending 2/6/3 bands with irregularities (e.g., row 5 has 2/1/6; row 7 has 3/6/3), but expected uniform top/middle/bottom 6/3/2 blocks with repeating rows—vertical smoothing overwrote horizontal patterns, creating false 1s and uneven fills.
 * No training sample passed, indicating the linear neighbor mode (only left/right or up/down) doesn't capture 2D locality well; needs fuller neighborhoods or region-based filling.
 * The compute_mode tie-breaker (max value) sometimes favors high numbers incorrectly (e.g., 9s over 6s in test), but it's not the core issue—lack of iteration or boundary detection is.
 * Transpose is helpful for reorientation but applying it rigidly without inverse or multiple steps misaligns outputs (e.g., expected patterns aren't transposed back).
 * Simple smoothing functions like smooth_row and smooth_grid_vertical are partially helpful for local noise but broken for global structure—they propagate too aggressively without respecting block connectivity, leading to smeared results; not sufficient alone, but could be built upon with iterations or masks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which might be essential for identifying dominant regions (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of same value and expand them); current approach treats all pixels equally, missing this.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it remains highly noisy with scattered values (e.g., isolated 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 8s, 9s in irregular clusters) and incomplete fills (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s/7s/8s; rows 14-24 show patchy 0/2/6/9/8 bands with jagged edges like single 7s or 4s), failing to form the clean, rectangular blocks seen in training expectations.
 * Unlike expectations' uniform horizontal bands (e.g., full rows of same value or clear column-wise shifts), the output has over-propagated 9s in corners/top and fragmented middle regions (e.g., 0s not fully expanding to background blocks; 2s forming small irregular shapes instead of solid areas), suggesting the transpose + dual smoothing smeared noise without resolving underlying structures.
 * It doesn't make sense as a cleaned puzzle—looks more like partially denoised input than a solved pattern (e.g., no coherent shapes like letters/symbols emerge; values like 4s and 7s appear as outliers where 9/6/8/0/3/2 should dominate blocks).
 * To handle test case, need to prevent boundary bleed (e.g., 9s invading 6/0 areas) and promote vertical consistency (e.g., expand 3s downward fully); current method's single-pass linear smoothing can't achieve this, as seen in persistent scatter.

[2025-10-03 15:37:52] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected regions) that must be transformed according to specific pattern-based rules, producing output grids with large uniform blocks or stripes of numbers, often filling or outlining detected structures like blobs or lines. The goal is to recognize and manipulate connected components or regions in the input to match structured, repetitive expected outputs, rather than simple operations like transposition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain scattered numbers (0-9) forming irregular patterns or "blobs" of connected same-valued cells (likely 4-connected or 8-connected), and the output reinterprets these into horizontal bands or blocks of uniform values, suggesting rules for grouping, filling, or mirroring regions.
 * Outputs often feature repeating rows of the same pattern (e.g., entire rows of 7s with a small block of 3s in specific columns), indicating vertical symmetry or replication across rows, but with transitions between block types (e.g., from 7s to 3s to 0s) based on input structure.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have jagged edges or isolated cells (e.g., single 1s or small clusters), but outputs simplify them into clean rectangular blocks, possibly by expanding, contracting, or selecting dominant values per "layer" or section.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so rules must be size-agnostic; outputs preserve dimensions but reorganize content.
 * Connected components seem key: inputs show clusters (e.g., 3s forming shapes), outputs map them to filled regions (e.g., all 3s become a horizontal stripe across multiple rows).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the max key (may need adjustment for puzzle ties).

    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

```python
def group_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    """
    Groups consecutive columns by their mode, returning list of (mode, width) tuples.
    Useful for detecting vertical strips of similar columns (e.g., in training 1, might group cols with mode 7).
    However, broken for the puzzle as it doesn't handle row-wise filling or horizontal blocks in expected outputs—don't use as core logic without major changes.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups
```

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where scattered or patterned numbers in an input grid are resolved into structured blocks or bands of uniform values, likely based on dominance, frequency, or regional grouping rules rather than global uniform filling. The goal appears to be creating clean, horizontal or block-like patterns that preserve some aspects of the original structure, such as partial extensions or transitions between values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The transformation seems to involve identifying horizontal bands or rows/sections where a dominant value (possibly mode or majority) fills most of the space, but with subtle extensions or overrides in specific columns (e.g., in training example 1, 7s extend into the right side of 3 and 0 blocks, and 3s appear in a middle band with partial 7s).
 * Not all rows become fully uniform; instead, patterns show vertical consistency in columns while allowing horizontal segmentation (e.g., training example 2 has repeating rows with mixed blocks like 6s transitioning to 7s or 9s in specific positions, not full-row fills).
 * Ties in frequency or modes may favor certain values (e.g., maximum value in ties, as attempted), but the rule isn't purely row/column mode— it might require regional analysis, like connected components or blobs of similar values.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs often repeat the same row pattern multiple times vertically (e.g., 4 identical rows of a pattern in example 1), suggesting vertical stacking or propagation of horizontal decisions; transitions between blocks aren't abrupt but can have overlaps (e.g., example 3 has mixed values in middle rows before uniform 6s and 4s).
 * Potential for "scattered patterns" to simplify into "clean horizontal bands," but not via simple transpose-and-fill, as that loses positional details like the 3s interrupting 7s in example 1.
 * No evidence of rotation, mirroring, or non-numeric operations; focus on integer values (0-9) and their grouping.
 * Easy to miss: The output preserves some original positional relationships (e.g., right-side columns in example 1 keep 7s across changing bands), and not everything is filled uniformly—minority values can dominate in sub-regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for analyzing columns if the rule involves vertical dominance, but over-reliance leads to errors as seen.)

```python
def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This handles frequency-based decisions with tie-breaking, which aligns with potential dominance rules, but needs adaptation for regions, not full rows/columns.)

```python
def fill_row_with_mode(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fills a row with its computed mode value.
    Handles the transformation rule of uniform filling based on row dominance.
    """
    mode = compute_mode(row)
    return [mode for _ in row]
```
(This simplifies patterns to uniforms, which partially captures "clean bands" but fails on partial fills and positional preservation; not sufficient alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used transpose then mode-fill on transposed rows, creating fully uniform horizontal bands in the output (e.g., entire rows of 6s, 7s, 4s in training 1), which worked for simplifying scattered values into blocks but failed to preserve mixed patterns like the 3s interrupting 7s or the right-side 7 extensions in training example 1.
 * In training example 1, generated all-6s (top), all-7s (middle), all-4s (bottom) blocks, but expected has vertical repetition of mixed rows (e.g., 7s with partial 3s and 7s on right, then 3s with 7s on right, then 0s with 3s and 7s), so it over-uniformized and ignored column-specific propagations.
 * Training example 2 generated stacked uniform rows (8s, 3s, 7s, etc.), but expected has repeating mixed blocks (e.g., 6s transitioning to 7s on right, with 8s and 9s in middle sections), missing horizontal segmentation and vertical consistency in sub-columns.
 * Training example 3 generated uniform 6s and 4s blocks with a single 1s row, but expected has top uniform 5s/3s bands transitioning to mixed middle rows (7/8/6/3/6/4 patterns) before uniform bottoms, so it collapsed diverse middle rows incorrectly.
 * Training example 4 generated scattered uniform rows (6s, 4s, 1s, 3s), but expected has repeating 6/2 and 3/2 blocks vertically, indicating failure to group and propagate patterns across multiple rows.
 * Transpose was helpful for column analysis but combined with full-row fill made outputs too simplistic, losing regional details; compute_mode is relevant for dominance but needs per-segment application, not whole rows.
 * No object extraction functions were used or proposed, but the puzzle might benefit from identifying "blobs" or connected regions of values (unexplored so far); fill_row_with_mode is partially helpful for uniform bands but broken for mixed rows—don't use it without segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it consists of fully uniform long rows (30 elements each) of single values (9s, 6s, 0s, 2s, 4s) stacked vertically into large blocks, which mirrors the over-simplification seen in training examples and ignores likely mixed or segmented patterns.
 * It generates a top row of all 9s (unusual, as inputs probably don't have such dominance), then blocks of 6s (3 rows), 0s (4 rows), 9s (4 rows), 0s (1 row), 9s (1 row), 2s (8 rows), 9s (4 rows), 4s (4 rows), suggesting the transpose-mode-fill blindly propagated column modes without considering horizontal variations or regional rules.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected outputs from training show repeated but mixed rows (e.g., partial fills in columns), not monolithic blocks; it likely mismatches by not handling transitions or sub-regions, making the output too uniform and grid-filling without subtlety.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers that appear to represent noisy images or patterns (e.g., blocky shapes or regions of uniform values like letters, numbers, or symbols), where the task is to apply transformations to denoise or clean the input grid, revealing coherent, structured blocks of identical values as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The inputs are noisy versions of structured grids with rectangular or block-like regions of the same number (e.g., large uniform areas separated by boundaries), and the goal is to propagate dominant values across regions while suppressing outliers or noise without over-smoothing across distinct boundaries.
 * Expected outputs preserve sharp edges between different regions (e.g., horizontal/vertical lines of transition) and expand or fill uniform blocks consistently across rows/columns, often resulting in symmetric or repeating patterns like stacked rectangles.
 * Subtle elements include handling edges/corners differently (e.g., fewer neighbors), resolving ties in mode by favoring maximum values, and avoiding bleed-over between adjacent but distinct regions (e.g., a single outlier shouldn't propagate to dominate a whole block).
 * Transposition is used to reorient vertical structures horizontally for processing, but over-application of smoothing can blur boundaries or incorrectly fill regions (e.g., turning isolated noise into false extensions).
 * Patterns often involve decreasing or increasing value gradients vertically/horizontally, with some regions "growing" downward or rightward in the expectations.
 * Noise includes scattered single values or small clusters that should be overwritten by surrounding majorities, but smoothing must be directional or iterative to match exact block shapes.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 10x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; empty or zero values may represent backgrounds that should expand but not override foregrounds.
 * Iterative smoothing (multiple passes) might be needed for propagation, but single passes as in the attempt cause incomplete fills.
 * No rotation or scaling is evident; focus on local neighborhood consensus (e.g., 3x3 or linear neighbors) to build larger structures.

def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:
    """

(This function is useful for local consensus but needs better tie-breaking or weighting for boundaries.)

```python
def smooth_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """

    Handles edges by using available neighbors.
    This rule handles local noise reduction in rows, preserving block-like structures.

        return []
    n = len(row)
    smoothed = row[:]
    for i in range(n):
        neighbors = [row[i]]
        if i > 0:
            neighbors.append(row[i - 1])
        if i < n - 1:
            neighbors.append(row[i + 1])
        smoothed[i] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return smoothed
```
(This is helpful for 1D denoising but insufficient alone; extend to 2D neighborhoods for better block preservation.)

```python
def smooth_grid_vertical(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Smooths each column vertically by treating columns as rows and applying smooth_row.
    This rule handles vertical noise reduction, complementing horizontal smoothing.

    n_cols = len(g[0])
    smoothed = [row[:] for row in g]
    for j in range(n_cols):
        col = [g[i][j] for i in range(n_rows)]
        smoothed_col = smooth_row(col)
        for i in range(n_rows):
            smoothed[i][j] = smoothed_col[i]
    return smoothed
```
(This complements row smoothing but causes over-smoothing in vertical directions, blurring expected sharp horizontal bands.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Transposes the grid, swapping rows and columns.
    This core transformation reorients the input to align vertical structures horizontally.
    """
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is potentially useful for handling asymmetric noise but in the attempt, applying it once before smoothing misaligns structures, leading to incorrect propagation.)

(No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; future attempts might need flood-fill or region-growing to identify and clean blocks explicitly, as simple neighbor mode doesn't capture connected components well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used transposition followed by horizontal row smoothing and then vertical column smoothing, aiming for noise reduction via local modes, but this over-smoothed and incorrectly propagated values across boundaries, failing to produce the blocky, uniform regions in expectations.
 * In Training 1, generated output created uniform top bands of 6/7/8 and bottom bands of 4/7/8 with scattered 9s, but expected clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0 with sharp vertical offsets (e.g., columns 11-13 as 3s, rest 7s in top; full 3s in middle; 0/3 in bottom)—the smoothing filled too much horizontally after transpose, ignoring vertical block integrity.
 * In Training 2, generated irregular bands of 7/8/3/5/9 with jagged edges (e.g., row 4 has 7s then 3s; row 9 has mixed 3/6), but expected structured blocks like top 6s, middle 3/8/6 bands, and bottom 3/8/9/7—transpose + smoothing created false vertical fills (e.g., 9s appearing where 6s should dominate).
 * In Training 3, generated mixed 6/4/3/8/5/9 with incomplete blocks (e.g., row 1 all 6/9; row 4 has 6/4/8), but expected top 5/3 bands, middle 7/8/6/3/6/4—smoothing failed to expand 3s leftward or align vertical columns properly, leaving noise like isolated 5s.
 * In Training 4, generated descending 2/6/3 bands with irregularities (e.g., row 5 has 2/1/6; row 7 has 3/6/3), but expected uniform top/middle/bottom 6/3/2 blocks with repeating rows—vertical smoothing overwrote horizontal patterns, creating false 1s and uneven fills.
 * No training sample passed, indicating the linear neighbor mode (only left/right or up/down) doesn't capture 2D locality well; needs fuller neighborhoods or region-based filling.
 * The compute_mode tie-breaker (max value) sometimes favors high numbers incorrectly (e.g., 9s over 6s in test), but it's not the core issue—lack of iteration or boundary detection is.
 * Transpose is helpful for reorientation but applying it rigidly without inverse or multiple steps misaligns outputs (e.g., expected patterns aren't transposed back).
 * Simple smoothing functions like smooth_row and smooth_grid_vertical are partially helpful for local noise but broken for global structure—they propagate too aggressively without respecting block connectivity, leading to smeared results; not sufficient alone, but could be built upon with iterations or masks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which might be essential for identifying dominant regions (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of same value and expand them); current approach treats all pixels equally, missing this.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it remains highly noisy with scattered values (e.g., isolated 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 8s, 9s in irregular clusters) and incomplete fills (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s/7s/8s; rows 14-24 show patchy 0/2/6/9/8 bands with jagged edges like single 7s or 4s), failing to form the clean, rectangular blocks seen in training expectations.
 * Unlike expectations' uniform horizontal bands (e.g., full rows of same value or clear column-wise shifts), the output has over-propagated 9s in corners/top and fragmented middle regions (e.g., 0s not fully expanding to background blocks; 2s forming small irregular shapes instead of solid areas), suggesting the transpose + dual smoothing smeared noise without resolving underlying structures.
 * It doesn't make sense as a cleaned puzzle—looks more like partially denoised input than a solved pattern (e.g., no coherent shapes like letters/symbols emerge; values like 4s and 7s appear as outliers where 9/6/8/0/3/2 should dominate blocks).
 * To handle test case, need to prevent boundary bleed (e.g., 9s invading 6/0 areas) and promote vertical consistency (e.g., expand 3s downward fully); current method's single-pass linear smoothing can't achieve this, as seen in persistent scatter.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:40:28] Response:
**High level:** This is a puzzle involving transforming input grids of integers (likely representing pixel colors or labels in a visual pattern) into output grids that simplify or correct the structure, emphasizing blocky, uniform regions while preserving distinct shapes and boundaries of "objects" or blobs, possibly through region filling, noise removal, or segmentation rules that propagate values selectively rather than uniformly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently show large uniform blocks of the same number (e.g., long stretches of 7s, 3s, or 9s), suggesting the goal is to expand or fill connected regions into rectangular or structured shapes, but without over-smoothing across unrelated areas.
 * Boundaries between regions must be sharp and respected; for example, in training example 1 expected output, there's a clear vertical stack of 7s on the right, with a thin 3-column band of 3s separating upper and lower sections, and a bottom band of 0s—generated output instead bleeds 6s and 4s incorrectly into these areas.
 * Grids may be non-square, and transposition is used in the program for dimension matching, but this seems to distort orientations; expected outputs maintain the input's row/column structure without flipping.
 * Iterative application is key for propagation, but the number of iterations (size//6 +1) is too aggressive or insufficient, leading to incomplete filling (e.g., in training example 2, generated has scattered 1s and 5s persisting, while expected has clean bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, and 9s).
 * Mode computation favors the maximum in ties, which may bias toward higher numbers (e.g., 9s dominating in test output), but expected outputs sometimes prioritize lower or specific values (e.g., 0s in example 1 bottom, 3s over others).
 * Edge handling in neighborhoods is basic (using available cells), but subtle: corners/edges should not leak values from distant regions; generated outputs show unwanted propagation (e.g., in example 3, 4s and 8s mix incorrectly, while expected has distinct horizontal bands and vertical alignments like 3s and 6s).
 * No global rules like thresholding or connectivity (e.g., 4-connected vs 8-connected) are applied; outputs suggest flood-fill-like behavior for blobs, but only within implied shapes—e.g., example 4 expected has repeating 6/3/2 bands vertically, but generated scatters 1s and uneven 6s.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve some asymmetry or "stair-step" boundaries (e.g., example 2 expected has 9s only in bottom-right), but smoothing erases them; also, empty or zero areas (like 0s in example 1) must remain as backgrounds, not filled.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), no object extraction is done—grids seem to contain multiple "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need individual processing, like identifying connected components before filling.
 * Considerations: Inputs may have noise (scattered single cells), which should be removed by majority in local regions, but not globally; test input has complex shapes (e.g., a large 9 background with embedded 3s, 0s, 2s, 6s, 4s, 7s, 8s), suggesting hierarchical filling where backgrounds expand but inner shapes hold.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for handling non-square grids if orientation matters, but may not be needed if outputs match input dimensions directly.)

```python
def compute_mode(values: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    if not values:
        return 0
    count = Counter(values)
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This is helpful for local majority voting in smoothing, but the tie-breaker (max value) may bias results incorrectly; consider alternatives like min or first occurrence.)

```python
def smooth_grid_2d(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Applies 2D smoothing to the grid by replacing each cell with the mode of its 3x3 neighborhood.
    Handles edges by using available neighbors.
    This rule promotes uniform regions by propagating dominant local values.
    """
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    n = len(g)
    m = len(g[0])
    new_g = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            neighbors = []
            for di in range(-1, 2):
                for dj in range(-1, 2):
                    ni = i + di
                    nj = j + dj
                    if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < m:
                        neighbors.append(g[ni][nj])
            new_g[i][j] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return new_g
```
(This is a core smoothing tool that works for local denoising but fails on global structure; useful as a building block, but needs integration with region detection.)

No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; a function like `extract_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]` (returning blobs) would be essential for isolating and filling shapes separately, as pure smoothing mixes everything.

The main `program` function combines transpose and iterative smoothing, which is a reasonable start for propagation but broken for boundary preservation—don't rely on it as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt uses iterative 2D mode-based smoothing after optional transpose, which partially works for expanding uniform regions (e.g., large 9 blocks in test output mimic background filling) but fails to preserve distinct blob shapes and introduces unwanted bleeding (e.g., 6s overwriting 0/3 areas).
 * Transposition for non-square grids mismatches orientations; in example 1 (12x16 input implied), it likely flips rows/columns, causing horizontal bands to become vertical incorrectly.
 * Smoothing iterations (size//6 +1) are too few or mismatched; example 2 generated leaves noise like 1s and 5s, while expected cleans to solid bands—propagation doesn't reach far enough or respects connectivity wrong.
 * Mode tie-breaking to max value biases high numbers (e.g., 8/9 dominating in example 3 generated vs. expected 3/6/4 bands).
 * No handling for background (0s) or specific value priorities; example 1 generated fills bottom with 4s instead of 0s, and upper with 6s instead of 7s.
 * Example 4 generated has uneven 6s and persistent 1s in a place expected to be clean 3s/2s, showing poor noise removal in sparse areas.
 * Overall, approach understands local majority but misses global rules like connected-component filling or shape recognition—e.g., all trainings have blocky, aligned rectangles in expected, but generated has jagged remnants.
 * Function `smooth_grid_2d` is helpful but incomplete (lacks connectivity); `transpose` may be irrelevant or harmful (don't use unless dimensions demand it); no unhelpful functions beyond that, but pure iteration without seeding or masking is not sufficient.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-smooths into massive 9/6/8/4/2/7 blocks with some jagged edges (e.g., scattered 0s and 2s in the middle persist partially, but large areas like the top-left 9s and bottom-right 4s expand too far), losing distinct embedded shapes like the 3-blob, 0-void, and 2-strip in the input.
 * It resembles aggressive denoising but ignores subtle boundaries—e.g., the input's vertical 3-column of 3s and horizontal 0/2 bands get partially erased into surrounding 9s/6s, while expected (inferred from trainings) should maintain clean, rectangular fills for each region without crossover (e.g., 0s as background voids, 2s as a thin inner strip).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats the error of bleeding values (like 9s overwriting 3s/7s), and the structure doesn't align to blocky patterns—e.g., the right-side 7/4 areas mix into 9s incorrectly; this suggests the program would fail if the test expected preserved object separations.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 15:40:34] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Rectangular color blocks**: Large pink, purple, yellow, green, black, and maroon rectangles forming backgrounds and divisions in various sizes and positions across all images.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train inputs/outputs (and noting consistency checks against test inputs where applicable, though focus is on train for consistency), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties/components that show clear, repeated patterns of interaction (e.g., embedding, adjacency, overlap, or positional influence) across **every** train example. I excluded anything inconsistent (e.g., Orange appears in some but not all inputs/outputs; irregular pixelated forms only prominent in train 3), irrelevant (e.g., isolated single-pixel shapes without adjacency to others), or non-interactive (e.g., total pixel sums or overall grid size, which vary without clear ties). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Transformations (e.g., how pixel counts or bboxes specifically change) are noted as unknown where not obviously explainable via position/color adjacency alone.

1. **Blue shapes (small components, 1-4 pixels) ↔ Larger rectangular blocks (Pink, Yellow, Green, Dark Red, Maroon)**:  
   Small Blue components consistently overlap or are adjacent (sharing bbox edges) to larger blocks in every input. This suggests embedding or bordering interaction, affecting block divisions (e.g., Blues inset within Pink/Yellow in train 1/2/3/4). Blues absent in all outputs, implying they influence but do not persist in merged forms. Consistent across all; no transformation details known beyond positional adjacency.

2. **Position (bbox coordinates) ↔ Color of larger blocks**:  
   Positional overlap between larger blocks (e.g., Dark Red overlapping Pink/Yellow) consistently occurs in every input, leading to output blocks with adjusted colors or sizes in overlapping regions (e.g., Dark Red dominates early positions in train 1/2/4). Specific bbox shifts unknown; interaction limited to evident overlap triggering color/position influence.

3. **Small non-Blue shapes (e.g., single-pixel Green, Light Blue) ↔ Adjacent larger blocks**:  
   Small Green/Light Blue components (1-5 pixels) are consistently adjacent to or embedded within larger blocks of different colors (e.g., Green pixel next to Dark Red/Pink in train 1/2/3; Light Blue within Yellow in train 1/2). Outputs show expanded blocks of the small shape's color in those adjacent areas (e.g., larger Green in train 1/2/3). Pixel expansion mechanism unknown; interaction tied to adjacency only.

4. **Maroon blocks ↔ Vertical position (y-coordinates)**:  
   Maroon components consistently occupy lower or bottom-dividing positions (high y-values, e.g., y=9-15 in train 1, y=3-9 in train 2/3/4) and interact with upper blocks via adjacency or shared edges. Outputs reposition Maroon to similar vertical roles (e.g., side or bottom strips in train 1/2/3/4). No horizontal interaction consistent; transformation to new bbox unknown.

5. **Light Blue (when present) ↔ Enclosed or nested positions**:  
   Light Blue components (5 pixels or less) consistently appear nested within larger Yellow/Pink/Dark Red blocks (bbox fully contained, e.g., train 1/2). Output Light Blue (train 2 only, but pattern holds where present) emerges from similar nested zones, suggesting positional enclosure influences its persistence/merging. Absent in other outputs; no color change explanation known.

No other connections (e.g., hole count influences, circular elements, or line extensions) are consistent across every train example—e.g., holes=0 everywhere in train but irrelevant to interactions; Orange circle only in train 3; thin blue lines not uniformly tied to transformations. Test inputs show similar patterns (e.g., Blues adjacent to large blocks, some holes=1 without clear tie), but consistency is train-only as specified.

[2025-10-03 15:40:58] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of all train inputs/outputs (and noting consistency checks against test inputs where applicable, though focus is on train for consistency), below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to properties/components that show clear, repeated patterns of interaction (e.g., embedding, adjacency, overlap, or positional influence) across **every** train example. I excluded anything inconsistent (e.g., Orange appears in some but not all inputs/outputs; irregular pixelated forms only prominent in train 3), irrelevant (e.g., isolated single-pixel shapes without adjacency to others), or non-interactive (e.g., total pixel sums or overall grid size, which vary without clear ties). No high-level puzzle solution is implied or attempted. Transformations (e.g., how pixel counts or bboxes specifically change) are noted as unknown where not obviously explainable via position/color adjacency alone.

1. **Blue shapes (small components, 1-4 pixels) ↔ Larger rectangular blocks (Pink, Yellow, Green, Dark Red, Maroon)**:  
   Small Blue components consistently overlap or are adjacent (sharing bbox edges) to larger blocks in every input. This suggests embedding or bordering interaction, affecting block divisions (e.g., Blues inset within Pink/Yellow in train 1/2/3/4). Blues absent in all outputs, implying they influence but do not persist in merged forms. Consistent across all; no transformation details known beyond positional adjacency.

2. **Position (bbox coordinates) ↔ Color of larger blocks**:  
   Positional overlap between larger blocks (e.g., Dark Red overlapping Pink/Yellow) consistently occurs in every input, leading to output blocks with adjusted colors or sizes in overlapping regions (e.g., Dark Red dominates early positions in train 1/2/4). Specific bbox shifts unknown; interaction limited to evident overlap triggering color/position influence.

3. **Small non-Blue shapes (e.g., single-pixel Green, Light Blue) ↔ Adjacent larger blocks**:  
   Small Green/Light Blue components (1-5 pixels) are consistently adjacent to or embedded within larger blocks of different colors (e.g., Green pixel next to Dark Red/Pink in train 1/2/3; Light Blue within Yellow in train 1/2). Outputs show expanded blocks of the small shape's color in those adjacent areas (e.g., larger Green in train 1/2/3). Pixel expansion mechanism unknown; interaction tied to adjacency only.

4. **Maroon blocks ↔ Vertical position (y-coordinates)**:  
   Maroon components consistently occupy lower or bottom-dividing positions (high y-values, e.g., y=9-15 in train 1, y=3-9 in train 2/3/4) and interact with upper blocks via adjacency or shared edges. Outputs reposition Maroon to similar vertical roles (e.g., side or bottom strips in train 1/2/3/4). No horizontal interaction consistent; transformation to new bbox unknown.

5. **Light Blue (when present) ↔ Enclosed or nested positions**:  
   Light Blue components (5 pixels or less) consistently appear nested within larger Yellow/Pink/Dark Red blocks (bbox fully contained, e.g., train 1/2). Output Light Blue (train 2 only, but pattern holds where present) emerges from similar nested zones, suggesting positional enclosure influences its persistence/merging. Absent in other outputs; no color change explanation known.

No other connections (e.g., hole count influences, circular elements, or line extensions) are consistent across every train example—e.g., holes=0 everywhere in train but irrelevant to interactions; Orange circle only in train 3; thin blue lines not uniformly tied to transformations. Test inputs show similar patterns (e.g., Blues adjacent to large blocks, some holes=1 without clear tie), but consistency is train-only as specified.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:44:26] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of input grids composed of colored blocks (integers 0-9 representing colors or background) into output grids through rules like filling holes, expanding or repositioning small shapes, resolving overlaps, and possibly rotating or resizing the grid to match output patterns. The goal is to identify and apply consistent rules across examples to produce structured block arrangements in the outputs, often simplifying or reorganizing components while preserving dominant colors and shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small blue shapes (1's, 1-4 pixels) appear embedded or adjacent to larger blocks and are filled by the nearest non-1 color using flood-fill (BFS), but this must be precise to avoid over-filling or altering large blocks unexpectedly.
 * Positional overlaps in larger blocks are resolved by dominance, such as taking the max color in a local neighborhood, but this can lead to uniform spreading if not bounded correctly; subtle overlaps may require component-based merging rather than local max.
 * Small non-blue shapes (e.g., 3's, 9's with <5 pixels) are expanded into adjacent larger blocks or repositioned, but expansions should be limited and directionally aware (e.g., toward dominant areas) to avoid infinite growth or incorrect absorption.
 * Maroon blocks (8's) tend to migrate to bottom or side positions in outputs, suggesting a repositioning rule like shifting to lower rows/columns, but this must account for grid size changes and avoid overwriting other elements.
 * Light blue (9's, small and nested) may emerge or expand inward from enclosures, checking for uniform surrounding colors, but only if fully nested (all 4 directions same non-9); partial nesting or edge cases can break this.
 * Outputs often have consistent dimensions or transpositions (e.g., rotating the grid), with blocks stretching vertically/horizontally; background (0's) fills unused areas, and small components may disappear or merge entirely.
 * Color counts and connectivity matter: large components (>5 pixels) dominate, small ones are absorbed or moved; 4-connectivity for floods, but 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonals in some shapes.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., inputs 10x10 to 30x?, outputs rectangular blocks), so rules must handle padding with 0's and potential transposition/resize at the end.
 * Subtle: Some colors like 3's or 9's invert positions (top to bottom), 8's cluster at edges; avoid assuming all small shapes behave the same—9's may stay nested while 3's expand/merge.
 * All examples show simplification: complex nested inputs become layered horizontal/vertical bands of colors, with no isolated small pixels in outputs.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque, Counter

# Multi-source BFS for filling holes (from handle_small_blue_interaction) - useful for propagating colors into 1's, but needs refinement for distance-based nearest color.

    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]

            if g[i][j] != 1:

        x, y, color = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and g[nx][ny] == 1:
                g[nx][ny] = color
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny, color))
    return g

# Transpose function (from transpose_grid) - helpful for final orientation if outputs are rotated versions.
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]

# Color count helper (from expand_small_non_blue) - essential for identifying small vs. large components.
def get_small_colors(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    color_counts = Counter()
    for row in g:
        for val in row:
            if val != 0 and val != 1:
                color_counts[val] += 1
    return [col for col, cnt in color_counts.items() if cnt < 5]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program applies a sequence of filling, adjustment, expansion, repositioning, enclosure handling, and transpose, but all training examples failed, indicating over-application or incorrect order of rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated large top blocks of 6/7 with misplaced 9's/4's/8's at bottom, but expected vertical bands of 7/3 with 0's filling lower areas; missed repositioning 3's to mid-bottom and eliminating small 4/9 intrusions, over-expanded 8's incorrectly.
 * Training example 2: Generated scattered 7/8/6/3 with misplaced 5's, but expected structured 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 layers; failed to merge small 3's into bands, incorrectly positioned 8's and introduced non-existent 5's (likely from bad adjustment).
 * Training example 3: Generated horizontal 6/9/3/4/8 bands with 0's, but expected mixed 5/3/7/8/6/4 layers; incorrectly introduced 5's (not in input?) and failed to create the specific vertical stacking with 3's dominating mid-section.
 * Training example 4: Generated vertical 2/6/3/4 bands, but expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers with 2's at right; missed horizontal reorganization and stretching of 6's across rows.
 * handle_position_color_adjustment (max in 3x3) caused unwanted spreading (e.g., uniform 7's in ex1), not helpful—replace with component merging.
 * expand_small_non_blue over-expands without proper limits or directionality, leading to blob distortion (e.g., small 3's overtaking areas in ex2); broken for large grids.
 * reposition_maroon_blocks moves 8's arbitrarily without preserving counts or avoiding overlaps, causing bottom clutter (ex1); not helpful as is—needs target position calculation based on output patterns.
 * handle_light_blue_enclosure checks nesting but expands outward incorrectly, creating artifacts (e.g., 9's leaking in ex1); subtle nesting detection misses edges, making it unreliable.
 * Overall, sequence starts with filling (somewhat correct for 1's) but cascades errors; no object extraction, so rules apply pixel-wise instead of shape-wise, missing connected components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid (inferred from rows) with messy, irregular bands of 9's dominating left/top, interspersed with 6's, 3's, 2's, 8's, and scattered 0's/7's/4's, lacking the clean horizontal/vertical block structure seen in expected training outputs.
 * It does not look correct: Expected outputs have uniform, stretched color bands (e.g., full-row 7's or 6's with sharp transitions), but this has jagged edges, isolated pixels (e.g., single 7's), and over-proliferated 9's/8's without clear layering; likely from faulty filling/expansion propagating errors across the large input.
 * Missing simplification: Input has complex nesting (3's in 9's, 2's in 0's, 8's at bottom-right), but output should resolve to banded layers (e.g., 9's as background enclosure, 6's as mid-band, 2's/3's repositioned); instead, it retains too much input chaos.
 * Does not match test considerations: Large size suggests need for scalable rules (e.g., component sizes), but output has uneven 0-fills and misplaced small colors (4's/7's appearing erroneously), indicating broken color propagation.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 15:44:36] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (1-4). I focused only on properties derivable from the data (color, holes, bbox position/size, pixels) and visual descriptions provided. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel components without positional overlap, inconsistent color changes) are included. Interactions must be consistent across all trains: small Blues always present in inputs and absent in outputs; large regions always expand/merge; no holes in outputs. Unknown transformations (e.g., why specific colors like Orange become Light Blue in train 2 but not others) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Small Blue components (pixels=1 or 4, small bboxes like [x,y,x,y] or [x,y,x+1,y+1]) embedded within or adjacent to large colored regions (e.g., Pink, Green, Yellow, Dark Red/Maroon bbox spans >5 units in width/height, pixels>20)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Positional overlap or adjacency (bbox intersection/enclosure) between small Blues and large regions consistently leads to absorption of Blues into the large region. Blues disappear in outputs; large regions expand bbox and increase pixels (e.g., train 1: multiple Blues inside Pink/Dark Red bboxes merge into larger Dark Red/Green; train 2-4 similar with Blues inside Pink/Green/Red). This is consistent as the primary "embedding" effect across all trains.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (bbox enclosure), size (small vs. large), pixels (added to large region, though exact summation unknown due to overlaps).  
   - **Effect**: Transformation of large region (expansion/merging); no color change directly tied to Blues alone.

2. **Large Green regions (input: scattered small Greens, pixels<10, bboxes <3 units; output: single large Green, bbox span >10 units, pixels>20)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Small Greens consistently connect/merge with adjacent large regions (e.g., Pink, Dark Red, Yellow) via shared bbox edges or Blues in between, forming one dominant Green in every output. (e.g., train 1: small Greens [3,3,3,3] merge into [0,0,12,11]; train 2-4 similar vertical/horizontal expansions). No exceptions across trains.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (adjacent/overlapping bboxes), color (Green as "anchor" for merging), pixels (cumulative increase).  
   - **Effect**: Consistent bbox union into a central/large Green; interacts with all other large colors but always results in Green presence in outputs.

3. **Pink/Dark Red regions (input: large Pink or Dark Red, bboxes spanning left/central areas, pixels>20; output: merged into Dark Red/Pink with expanded bboxes)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Positional adjacency (horizontal/vertical bbox overlap) between Pink and Dark Red consistently causes mutual merging or partial absorption, with Blues facilitating (e.g., train 1: Pink [0,0,4,9] + Dark Red [0,0,11,12] -> Dark Red [0,0,9,3]; train 2: Pink small + Dark Red -> larger Dark Red [8,0,9,9]; train 3-4 similar left-side expansions). Always involves left/central grid-like layouts.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (left-central alignment), color (Pink -> Dark Red dominance), pixels (increase via merger).  
   - **Effect**: Expansion toward right/lower areas; consistent color preference (Dark Red over Pink in 3/4 trains, but Pink persists in others).

4. **Maroon regions (input: bottom or right bboxes, pixels>10; output: preserved/expanded Maroon with no holes)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Maroon consistently interacts with lower/adjacent Blues or Greens via bbox overlap, leading to vertical expansion without color change (e.g., train 1: Maroon [0,13,11,15] unchanged but contextual merge; train 2: [0,3,2,9] expands slightly; train 3-4 similar bottom integrations). Always bottom-aligned in layouts.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (bottom bbox alignment), color (Maroon stable), pixels (slight increase).  
   - **Effect**: Stabilizes as a "base" layer; interacts with Greens/Blues for height growth.

5. **Holes property (all inputs: holes=0 except rare cases; outputs: always holes=0)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Any potential holes (none consistent in trains) are eliminated in mergers; large regions with embedded Blues maintain holes=0 post-transformation across all outputs. No hole creation observed.  
   - **Properties involved**: Holes count (0 -> 0), tied to bbox expansion (filling internal spaces).  
   - **Effect**: Ensures solid (no-hole) large components; consistent "filling" via mergers.

### Notes on Unknowns/Limitations
- Color-specific transformations (e.g., Orange to Light Blue in train 2, bbox/pixels unchanged) are not consistent across all trains (Orange expands without change in train 3, absent in 1/4), so not included as an interaction.
- Irregular outlines/jagged edges (mentioned in description for Green/Black/Orange) cannot be directly observed from bbox data (axis-aligned), so no positional edge-based interaction identified; possibly affects pixel counts but inconsistent verification.
- Circular/protruding features (e.g., Orange partial circles, T-shapes) appear in some inputs (train 2-3) but not all, and their bbox transformations vary (unknown rule).
- No interactions found for Yellow (present in 1,3 but inconsistent merger) or Light Blue (rare, only in train 2 output).
- Total pixel sums in outputs approximate input sums but not exact (e.g., due to overlaps/losses, unknown cause).
- Test inputs follow similar patterns (many small Blues, large Greens/Pinks, some holes), but analysis limited to trains for consistency.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 15:45:02] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Identified Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements. These are limited to patterns that appear in **every** train example (1-4). I focused only on properties derivable from the data (color, holes, bbox position/size, pixels) and visual descriptions provided. No high-level puzzle solution or irrelevant/irregular elements (e.g., isolated single-pixel components without positional overlap, inconsistent color changes) are included. Interactions must be consistent across all trains: small Blues always present in inputs and absent in outputs; large regions always expand/merge; no holes in outputs. Unknown transformations (e.g., why specific colors like Orange become Light Blue in train 2 but not others) are noted as such rather than explained.

1. **Small Blue components (pixels=1 or 4, small bboxes like [x,y,x,y] or [x,y,x+1,y+1]) embedded within or adjacent to large colored regions (e.g., Pink, Green, Yellow, Dark Red/Maroon bbox spans >5 units in width/height, pixels>20)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Positional overlap or adjacency (bbox intersection/enclosure) between small Blues and large regions consistently leads to absorption of Blues into the large region. Blues disappear in outputs; large regions expand bbox and increase pixels (e.g., train 1: multiple Blues inside Pink/Dark Red bboxes merge into larger Dark Red/Green; train 2-4 similar with Blues inside Pink/Green/Red). This is consistent as the primary "embedding" effect across all trains.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (bbox enclosure), size (small vs. large), pixels (added to large region, though exact summation unknown due to overlaps).  
   - **Effect**: Transformation of large region (expansion/merging); no color change directly tied to Blues alone.

2. **Large Green regions (input: scattered small Greens, pixels<10, bboxes <3 units; output: single large Green, bbox span >10 units, pixels>20)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Small Greens consistently connect/merge with adjacent large regions (e.g., Pink, Dark Red, Yellow) via shared bbox edges or Blues in between, forming one dominant Green in every output. (e.g., train 1: small Greens [3,3,3,3] merge into [0,0,12,11]; train 2-4 similar vertical/horizontal expansions). No exceptions across trains.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (adjacent/overlapping bboxes), color (Green as "anchor" for merging), pixels (cumulative increase).  
   - **Effect**: Consistent bbox union into a central/large Green; interacts with all other large colors but always results in Green presence in outputs.

3. **Pink/Dark Red regions (input: large Pink or Dark Red, bboxes spanning left/central areas, pixels>20; output: merged into Dark Red/Pink with expanded bboxes)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Positional adjacency (horizontal/vertical bbox overlap) between Pink and Dark Red consistently causes mutual merging or partial absorption, with Blues facilitating (e.g., train 1: Pink [0,0,4,9] + Dark Red [0,0,11,12] -> Dark Red [0,0,9,3]; train 2: Pink small + Dark Red -> larger Dark Red [8,0,9,9]; train 3-4 similar left-side expansions). Always involves left/central grid-like layouts.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (left-central alignment), color (Pink -> Dark Red dominance), pixels (increase via merger).  
   - **Effect**: Expansion toward right/lower areas; consistent color preference (Dark Red over Pink in 3/4 trains, but Pink persists in others).

4. **Maroon regions (input: bottom or right bboxes, pixels>10; output: preserved/expanded Maroon with no holes)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Maroon consistently interacts with lower/adjacent Blues or Greens via bbox overlap, leading to vertical expansion without color change (e.g., train 1: Maroon [0,13,11,15] unchanged but contextual merge; train 2: [0,3,2,9] expands slightly; train 3-4 similar bottom integrations). Always bottom-aligned in layouts.  
   - **Properties involved**: Position (bottom bbox alignment), color (Maroon stable), pixels (slight increase).  
   - **Effect**: Stabilizes as a "base" layer; interacts with Greens/Blues for height growth.

5. **Holes property (all inputs: holes=0 except rare cases; outputs: always holes=0)**:  
   - **Interaction**: Any potential holes (none consistent in trains) are eliminated in mergers; large regions with embedded Blues maintain holes=0 post-transformation across all outputs. No hole creation observed.  
   - **Properties involved**: Holes count (0 -> 0), tied to bbox expansion (filling internal spaces).  
   - **Effect**: Ensures solid (no-hole) large components; consistent "filling" via mergers.

### Notes on Unknowns/Limitations
- Color-specific transformations (e.g., Orange to Light Blue in train 2, bbox/pixels unchanged) are not consistent across all trains (Orange expands without change in train 3, absent in 1/4), so not included as an interaction.
- Irregular outlines/jagged edges (mentioned in description for Green/Black/Orange) cannot be directly observed from bbox data (axis-aligned), so no positional edge-based interaction identified; possibly affects pixel counts but inconsistent verification.
- Circular/protruding features (e.g., Orange partial circles, T-shapes) appear in some inputs (train 2-3) but not all, and their bbox transformations vary (unknown rule).
- No interactions found for Yellow (present in 1,3 but inconsistent merger) or Light Blue (rare, only in train 2 output).
- Total pixel sums in outputs approximate input sums but not exact (e.g., due to overlaps/losses, unknown cause).
- Test inputs follow similar patterns (many small Blues, large Greens/Pinks, some holes), but analysis limited to trains for consistency.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:48:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not grid:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return h, w
```
Basic grid dimensions utility, useful for bounds checking.

```python
def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Dict], List[Dict]]:
    # (Full implementation as in the program: BFS to find non-blue components and separately blue components)
    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 15:48:30] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (1-4), below is a list of only those interactions or connections between elements that are **obvious and consistent across EVERY train example**. I focused solely on properties like color, position (via bbox), pixel count, and shape attributes (e.g., holes, though none vary consistently). No high-level puzzle solving or total transformation explanations are included. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., Yellow, Pink, Orange, Light Blue) are excluded because they do not appear or interact consistently in all outputs or lack uniform effects across inputs/outputs. Only elements with detectable, repeatable interactions (e.g., one property affecting another) are listed. Where a specific interaction (e.g., exact mechanism) cannot be explained from the data, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Blue color → Output presence/absence**  
   - Consistent interaction: Blue blobs are present in every input as small, scattered components (pixel counts 1-5, bboxes typically 1-2 units wide/tall, no holes). They do not appear in any output. This indicates a consistent filtering effect where Blue elements are removed or do not contribute to output components, regardless of their input position or size.  
   - No effect on other colors' properties (e.g., no consistent change to adjacent bbox or pixel counts).  
   - Embedded nature: Blues often have bboxes overlapping or adjacent to Green or Red-variant bboxes in inputs, but this positioning does not alter output properties consistently (unknown if it defines edges without affecting transformation).

2. **Green color → Pixel count and bbox size (expansion)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Green blobs exist in every input and every output. Input Green pixel counts vary (1-26), but output Green always has higher pixel counts (21-66) and larger bboxes (spanning 2-12 units in width/height). This suggests a consistent expansion effect where input Green absorbs or merges with surrounding non-Green pixels, increasing its size.  
   - Position effect: Input Green bboxes (often mid-grid, e.g., x=3-9) influence output Green bboxes to cover broader left/central areas (e.g., starting from x=0 in all outputs). Position of input Green consistently shifts output Green to overlap input grid origins (y=0 or y=3 start).  
   - Hole count interaction: All Green blobs have holes=0 in inputs/outputs; no effect observed.  
   - Unknown: Exact pixels merged (e.g., from which adjacent colors) or dominance rules over overlaps.

3. **Red variants (Dark Red/Red/Maroon) → Layering via position and overlap**  
   - Consistent interaction: Red-variant blobs (Dark Red, Red, or Maroon) appear in every input and every output, forming large structures (input pixels 1-53, output 14-36). They consistently interact with Green in outputs by overlapping bboxes (e.g., shared x=0 start or adjacent x-ranges), creating layered regions where Red-variant occupies edges/sides.  
   - Position → Position effect: Input Red-variant bboxes (often wide, e.g., x=0-11 or y=0-12) determine output positions, with outputs placing them on left/right peripheries (e.g., x=0-9 or x=13-15 in train 1; x=8-9 or x=3-4 in others). Adjacent input positions to Green consistently result in output overlap without color change to Green.  
   - Pixel count effect: Output Red-variant pixels (20-36) are consistently higher than individual input ones but do not sum directly from Green (unknown merging source).  
   - Color variant consistency: Dark Red/Red/Maroon treat as interchangeable for interaction (e.g., no distinct effects by shade); all preserve red-like presence in outputs.  
   - Hole count interaction: All have holes=0; no effect.  
   - Unknown: How overlaps resolve visibility (e.g., which color dominates in shared bbox areas) or exact pixel addition rules.

4. **Green ↔ Red variants (position-based adjacency → Output bbox overlap)**  
   - Consistent interaction: In every input, Green and Red-variant bboxes are adjacent or overlapping (e.g., shared x/y ranges like 0-11). This consistently leads to output bboxes where Green and Red-variant overlap (e.g., both starting at [0,0] or adjacent columns). No color change occurs; instead, it affects spatial transformation to form layered structures.  
   - Pixel count non-effect: Adjacency does not consistently alter individual pixel counts (e.g., no direct addition observed).  
   - Unknown: If adjacency triggers specific bbox expansion direction (e.g., Green expands inward, Red outward) or role in depth/layering order.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no uniform hole effects, as all relevant blobs have holes=0; no consistent color-to-color changes like position → color shift; smaller elements like single-pixel accents lack repeatable effects across all). Test inputs were not used for this list, as consistency is derived from train examples only.

[2025-10-03 15:49:23] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (1-4), below is a list of only those interactions or connections between elements that are **obvious and consistent across EVERY train example**. I focused solely on properties like color, position (via bbox), pixel count, and shape attributes (e.g., holes, though none vary consistently). No high-level puzzle solving or total transformation explanations are included. Irrelevant or non-interacting elements (e.g., Yellow, Pink, Orange, Light Blue) are excluded because they do not appear or interact consistently in all outputs or lack uniform effects across inputs/outputs. Only elements with detectable, repeatable interactions (e.g., one property affecting another) are listed. Where a specific interaction (e.g., exact mechanism) cannot be explained from the data, it is noted as unknown.

1. **Blue color → Output presence/absence**  
   - Consistent interaction: Blue blobs are present in every input as small, scattered components (pixel counts 1-5, bboxes typically 1-2 units wide/tall, no holes). They do not appear in any output. This indicates a consistent filtering effect where Blue elements are removed or do not contribute to output components, regardless of their input position or size.  
   - No effect on other colors' properties (e.g., no consistent change to adjacent bbox or pixel counts).  
   - Embedded nature: Blues often have bboxes overlapping or adjacent to Green or Red-variant bboxes in inputs, but this positioning does not alter output properties consistently (unknown if it defines edges without affecting transformation).

2. **Green color → Pixel count and bbox size (expansion)**  
   - Consistent interaction: Green blobs exist in every input and every output. Input Green pixel counts vary (1-26), but output Green always has higher pixel counts (21-66) and larger bboxes (spanning 2-12 units in width/height). This suggests a consistent expansion effect where input Green absorbs or merges with surrounding non-Green pixels, increasing its size.  
   - Position effect: Input Green bboxes (often mid-grid, e.g., x=3-9) influence output Green bboxes to cover broader left/central areas (e.g., starting from x=0 in all outputs). Position of input Green consistently shifts output Green to overlap input grid origins (y=0 or y=3 start).  
   - Hole count interaction: All Green blobs have holes=0 in inputs/outputs; no effect observed.  
   - Unknown: Exact pixels merged (e.g., from which adjacent colors) or dominance rules over overlaps.

3. **Red variants (Dark Red/Red/Maroon) → Layering via position and overlap**  
   - Consistent interaction: Red-variant blobs (Dark Red, Red, or Maroon) appear in every input and every output, forming large structures (input pixels 1-53, output 14-36). They consistently interact with Green in outputs by overlapping bboxes (e.g., shared x=0 start or adjacent x-ranges), creating layered regions where Red-variant occupies edges/sides.  
   - Position → Position effect: Input Red-variant bboxes (often wide, e.g., x=0-11 or y=0-12) determine output positions, with outputs placing them on left/right peripheries (e.g., x=0-9 or x=13-15 in train 1; x=8-9 or x=3-4 in others). Adjacent input positions to Green consistently result in output overlap without color change to Green.  
   - Pixel count effect: Output Red-variant pixels (20-36) are consistently higher than individual input ones but do not sum directly from Green (unknown merging source).  
   - Color variant consistency: Dark Red/Red/Maroon treat as interchangeable for interaction (e.g., no distinct effects by shade); all preserve red-like presence in outputs.  
   - Hole count interaction: All have holes=0; no effect.  
   - Unknown: How overlaps resolve visibility (e.g., which color dominates in shared bbox areas) or exact pixel addition rules.

4. **Green ↔ Red variants (position-based adjacency → Output bbox overlap)**  
   - Consistent interaction: In every input, Green and Red-variant bboxes are adjacent or overlapping (e.g., shared x/y ranges like 0-11). This consistently leads to output bboxes where Green and Red-variant overlap (e.g., both starting at [0,0] or adjacent columns). No color change occurs; instead, it affects spatial transformation to form layered structures.  
   - Pixel count non-effect: Adjacency does not consistently alter individual pixel counts (e.g., no direct addition observed).  
   - Unknown: If adjacency triggers specific bbox expansion direction (e.g., Green expands inward, Red outward) or role in depth/layering order.

No other consistent interactions were identifiable (e.g., no uniform hole effects, as all relevant blobs have holes=0; no consistent color-to-color changes like position → color shift; smaller elements like single-pixel accents lack repeatable effects across all). Test inputs were not used for this list, as consistency is derived from train examples only.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 15:52:45] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

[2025-10-03 15:52:49] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-10-03 15:53:18] Response:
- **Merging via positional adjacency or overlap**: Across all train examples, small components (e.g., Blue elements with pixels=1-5, single-pixel Green or Pink) have bboxes that are fully contained within, overlap, or are immediately adjacent to the bboxes of larger components (pixels>10, colors including Pink, Green, Yellow, Red/Dark Red, Maroon). In outputs, these small components are consistently absorbed into the larger ones, resulting in output bboxes that expand to encompass the input bboxes involved, and output pixel counts that equal the sum of the input pixel counts from the merged components (e.g., Train 4: Pink output pixels=21 sums Red=15 + Red=1 + Red=1 + Blue=4; Green output pixels=28 sums Pink=7 + Pink=12 + Pink=1 + Blue=4 + Blue=4). This interaction treats position (bbox) as the key connector for combining pixels regardless of input color.

- **Blue elements as absorbers/enablers**: Small Blue components (consistent properties: holes=0, pixels=1-5, often linear or inset based on narrow bbox dimensions like [x,x+1,y,y+1]) are present in every train input and are consistently merged into adjacent larger non-Blue components, contributing their pixels to the output pixel total without appearing as separate output elements (except Light Blue in Train 2, which is a distinct color variant). This suggests Blues interact via position to enable or facilitate merging but do not persist independently. No consistent color effect from Blues is observable (e.g., Train 4 top: Blue + Red → Pink output color; Train 4 right: Blue + Green → Red output color).

- **Color transformation independent of merging**: In every train example, some output components exhibit color changes from input colors even without pixel sum increases from merging (e.g., Train 4 bottom: Yellow input [0,7,6,9] pixels=21 → Pink output same bbox/pixels; Train 2: Orange input [5,8,7,9] pixels=6 → Light Blue output same bbox/pixels). The trigger for these transformations (e.g., specific position, bbox dimensions, or adjacency to other elements) is unknown and not consistently explainable from the data. Merged regions also show variable color outcomes (e.g., Pink + Blue → Green in Train 4 middle; Red + Blue → Pink in Train 4 top), with no obvious rule tying input colors/positions to output colors.

- **Green as a persistent hub**: Green components (larger ones with pixels>5) appear in every train input and output, consistently acting as a "hub" that either absorbs adjacent small elements (e.g., Train 1: output Green bbox [0,0,12,11] encompasses multiple input Yellow/Pink/Blue/Green positions) or maintains/expands its bbox to include them (e.g., Train 4: Green output [0,3,6,6] covers input Pink/Blue positions). Pixel increases for Green outputs always match summed adjacent inputs, indicating consistent positional interaction favoring Green expansion.

- **Irrelevant or non-interacting elements**: Small non-Green, non-Blue single-pixel elements (e.g., isolated Dark Red pixels=1 in Train 1/2) do not consistently interact or merge across examples and are often absorbed without affecting output color predictably; their role is unknown if not positionally tied to larger blocks. Light Blue appears sporadically (Trains 1-3 inputs) but only persists in one output (Train 2), with no consistent interaction pattern. Orange (Train 2/3) merges positionally like other colors but changes to other colors (e.g., to Light Blue), with transformation unknown. No consistent interactions involve holes (all=0 in trains), silhouettes, or movement effects beyond bbox expansion.

[2025-10-03 15:53:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected regions) that must be transformed according to specific pattern-based rules, producing output grids with large uniform blocks or stripes of numbers, often filling or outlining detected structures like blobs or lines. The goal is to recognize and manipulate connected components or regions in the input to match structured, repetitive expected outputs, rather than simple operations like transposition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain scattered numbers (0-9) forming irregular patterns or "blobs" of connected same-valued cells (likely 4-connected or 8-connected), and the output reinterprets these into horizontal bands or blocks of uniform values, suggesting rules for grouping, filling, or mirroring regions.
 * Outputs often feature repeating rows of the same pattern (e.g., entire rows of 7s with a small block of 3s in specific columns), indicating vertical symmetry or replication across rows, but with transitions between block types (e.g., from 7s to 3s to 0s) based on input structure.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have jagged edges or isolated cells (e.g., single 1s or small clusters), but outputs simplify them into clean rectangular blocks, possibly by expanding, contracting, or selecting dominant values per "layer" or section.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so rules must be size-agnostic; outputs preserve dimensions but reorganize content.
 * Connected components seem key: inputs show clusters (e.g., 3s forming shapes), outputs map them to filled regions (e.g., all 3s become a horizontal stripe across multiple rows).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the max key (may need adjustment for puzzle ties).
    Helpful for identifying dominant values in columns, but insufficient alone—needs integration with filling logic.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

```python
def group_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    """
    Groups consecutive columns by their mode, returning list of (mode, width) tuples.
    Useful for detecting vertical strips of similar columns (e.g., in training 1, might group cols with mode 7).
    However, broken for the puzzle as it doesn't handle row-wise filling or horizontal blocks in expected outputs—don't use as core logic without major changes.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups
```

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where scattered or patterned numbers in an input grid are resolved into structured blocks or bands of uniform values, likely based on dominance, frequency, or regional grouping rules rather than global uniform filling. The goal appears to be creating clean, horizontal or block-like patterns that preserve some aspects of the original structure, such as partial extensions or transitions between values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The transformation seems to involve identifying horizontal bands or rows/sections where a dominant value (possibly mode or majority) fills most of the space, but with subtle extensions or overrides in specific columns (e.g., in training example 1, 7s extend into the right side of 3 and 0 blocks, and 3s appear in a middle band with partial 7s).
 * Not all rows become fully uniform; instead, patterns show vertical consistency in columns while allowing horizontal segmentation (e.g., training example 2 has repeating rows with mixed blocks like 6s transitioning to 7s or 9s in specific positions, not full-row fills).
 * Ties in frequency or modes may favor certain values (e.g., maximum value in ties, as attempted), but the rule isn't purely row/column mode— it might require regional analysis, like connected components or blobs of similar values.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs often repeat the same row pattern multiple times vertically (e.g., 4 identical rows of a pattern in example 1), suggesting vertical stacking or propagation of horizontal decisions; transitions between blocks aren't abrupt but can have overlaps (e.g., example 3 has mixed values in middle rows before uniform 6s and 4s).
 * Potential for "scattered patterns" to simplify into "clean horizontal bands," but not via simple transpose-and-fill, as that loses positional details like the 3s interrupting 7s in example 1.
 * No evidence of rotation, mirroring, or non-numeric operations; focus on integer values (0-9) and their grouping.
 * Easy to miss: The output preserves some original positional relationships (e.g., right-side columns in example 1 keep 7s across changing bands), and not everything is filled uniformly—minority values can dominate in sub-regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for analyzing columns if the rule involves vertical dominance, but over-reliance leads to errors as seen.)

```python
def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This handles frequency-based decisions with tie-breaking, which aligns with potential dominance rules, but needs adaptation for regions, not full rows/columns.)

```python
def fill_row_with_mode(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fills a row with its computed mode value.
    Handles the transformation rule of uniform filling based on row dominance.
    """
    mode = compute_mode(row)
    return [mode for _ in row]
```
(This simplifies patterns to uniforms, which partially captures "clean bands" but fails on partial fills and positional preservation; not sufficient alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used transpose then mode-fill on transposed rows, creating fully uniform horizontal bands in the output (e.g., entire rows of 6s, 7s, 4s in training 1), which worked for simplifying scattered values into blocks but failed to preserve mixed patterns like the 3s interrupting 7s or the right-side 7 extensions in training example 1.
 * In training example 1, generated all-6s (top), all-7s (middle), all-4s (bottom) blocks, but expected has vertical repetition of mixed rows (e.g., 7s with partial 3s and 7s on right, then 3s with 7s on right, then 0s with 3s and 7s), so it over-uniformized and ignored column-specific propagations.
 * Training example 2 generated stacked uniform rows (8s, 3s, 7s, etc.), but expected has repeating mixed blocks (e.g., 6s transitioning to 7s on right, with 8s and 9s in middle sections), missing horizontal segmentation and vertical consistency in sub-columns.
 * Training example 3 generated uniform 6s and 4s blocks with a single 1s row, but expected has top uniform 5s/3s bands transitioning to mixed middle rows (7/8/6/3/6/4 patterns) before uniform bottoms, so it collapsed diverse middle rows incorrectly.
 * Training example 4 generated scattered uniform rows (6s, 4s, 1s, 3s), but expected has repeating 6/2 and 3/2 blocks vertically, indicating failure to group and propagate patterns across multiple rows.
 * Transpose was helpful for column analysis but combined with full-row fill made outputs too simplistic, losing regional details; compute_mode is relevant for dominance but needs per-segment application, not whole rows.
 * No object extraction functions were used or proposed, but the puzzle might benefit from identifying "blobs" or connected regions of values (unexplored so far); fill_row_with_mode is partially helpful for uniform bands but broken for mixed rows—don't use it without segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it consists of fully uniform long rows (30 elements each) of single values (9s, 6s, 0s, 2s, 4s) stacked vertically into large blocks, which mirrors the over-simplification seen in training examples and ignores likely mixed or segmented patterns.
 * It generates a top row of all 9s (unusual, as inputs probably don't have such dominance), then blocks of 6s (3 rows), 0s (4 rows), 9s (4 rows), 0s (1 row), 9s (1 row), 2s (8 rows), 9s (4 rows), 4s (4 rows), suggesting the transpose-mode-fill blindly propagated column modes without considering horizontal variations or regional rules.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected outputs from training show repeated but mixed rows (e.g., partial fills in columns), not monolithic blocks; it likely mismatches by not handling transitions or sub-regions, making the output too uniform and grid-filling without subtlety.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of input grids composed of colored blocks (integers 0-9 representing colors or background) into output grids through rules like filling holes, expanding or repositioning small shapes, resolving overlaps, and possibly rotating or resizing the grid to match output patterns. The goal is to identify and apply consistent rules across examples to produce structured block arrangements in the outputs, often simplifying or reorganizing components while preserving dominant colors and shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small blue shapes (1's, 1-4 pixels) appear embedded or adjacent to larger blocks and are filled by the nearest non-1 color using flood-fill (BFS), but this must be precise to avoid over-filling or altering large blocks unexpectedly.
 * Positional overlaps in larger blocks are resolved by dominance, such as taking the max color in a local neighborhood, but this can lead to uniform spreading if not bounded correctly; subtle overlaps may require component-based merging rather than local max.
 * Small non-blue shapes (e.g., 3's, 9's with <5 pixels) are expanded into adjacent larger blocks or repositioned, but expansions should be limited and directionally aware (e.g., toward dominant areas) to avoid infinite growth or incorrect absorption.
 * Maroon blocks (8's) tend to migrate to bottom or side positions in outputs, suggesting a repositioning rule like shifting to lower rows/columns, but this must account for grid size changes and avoid overwriting other elements.
 * Light blue (9's, small and nested) may emerge or expand inward from enclosures, checking for uniform surrounding colors, but only if fully nested (all 4 directions same non-9); partial nesting or edge cases can break this.
 * Outputs often have consistent dimensions or transpositions (e.g., rotating the grid), with blocks stretching vertically/horizontally; background (0's) fills unused areas, and small components may disappear or merge entirely.
 * Color counts and connectivity matter: large components (>5 pixels) dominate, small ones are absorbed or moved; 4-connectivity for floods, but 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonals in some shapes.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., inputs 10x10 to 30x?, outputs rectangular blocks), so rules must handle padding with 0's and potential transposition/resize at the end.
 * Subtle: Some colors like 3's or 9's invert positions (top to bottom), 8's cluster at edges; avoid assuming all small shapes behave the same—9's may stay nested while 3's expand/merge.
 * All examples show simplification: complex nested inputs become layered horizontal/vertical bands of colors, with no isolated small pixels in outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program applies a sequence of filling, adjustment, expansion, repositioning, enclosure handling, and transpose, but all training examples failed, indicating over-application or incorrect order of rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated large top blocks of 6/7 with misplaced 9's/4's/8's at bottom, but expected vertical bands of 7/3 with 0's filling lower areas; missed repositioning 3's to mid-bottom and eliminating small 4/9 intrusions, over-expanded 8's incorrectly.
 * Training example 2: Generated scattered 7/8/6/3 with misplaced 5's, but expected structured 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 layers; failed to merge small 3's into bands, incorrectly positioned 8's and introduced non-existent 5's (likely from bad adjustment).
 * Training example 3: Generated horizontal 6/9/3/4/8 bands with 0's, but expected mixed 5/3/7/8/6/4 layers; incorrectly introduced 5's (not in input?) and failed to create the specific vertical stacking with 3's dominating mid-section.
 * Training example 4: Generated vertical 2/6/3/4 bands, but expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers with 2's at right; missed horizontal reorganization and stretching of 6's across rows.
 * handle_position_color_adjustment (max in 3x3) caused unwanted spreading (e.g., uniform 7's in ex1), not helpful—replace with component merging.
 * expand_small_non_blue over-expands without proper limits or directionality, leading to blob distortion (e.g., small 3's overtaking areas in ex2); broken for large grids.
 * reposition_maroon_blocks moves 8's arbitrarily without preserving counts or avoiding overlaps, causing bottom clutter (ex1); not helpful as is—needs target position calculation based on output patterns.
 * handle_light_blue_enclosure checks nesting but expands outward incorrectly, creating artifacts (e.g., 9's leaking in ex1); subtle nesting detection misses edges, making it unreliable.
 * Overall, sequence starts with filling (somewhat correct for 1's) but cascades errors; no object extraction, so rules apply pixel-wise instead of shape-wise, missing connected components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid (inferred from rows) with messy, irregular bands of 9's dominating left/top, interspersed with 6's, 3's, 2's, 8's, and scattered 0's/7's/4's, lacking the clean horizontal/vertical block structure seen in expected training outputs.
 * It does not look correct: Expected outputs have uniform, stretched color bands (e.g., full-row 7's or 6's with sharp transitions), but this has jagged edges, isolated pixels (e.g., single 7's), and over-proliferated 9's/8's without clear layering; likely from faulty filling/expansion propagating errors across the large input.
 * Missing simplification: Input has complex nesting (3's in 9's, 2's in 0's, 8's at bottom-right), but output should resolve to banded layers (e.g., 9's as background enclosure, 6's as mid-band, 2's/3's repositioned); instead, it retains too much input chaos.
 * Does not match test considerations: Large size suggests need for scalable rules (e.g., component sizes), but output has uneven 0-fills and misplaced small colors (4's/7's appearing erroneously), indicating broken color propagation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers that appear to represent noisy images or patterns (e.g., blocky shapes or regions of uniform values like letters, numbers, or symbols), where the task is to apply transformations to denoise or clean the input grid, revealing coherent, structured blocks of identical values as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The inputs are noisy versions of structured grids with rectangular or block-like regions of the same number (e.g., large uniform areas separated by boundaries), and the goal is to propagate dominant values across regions while suppressing outliers or noise without over-smoothing across distinct boundaries.
 * Expected outputs preserve sharp edges between different regions (e.g., horizontal/vertical lines of transition) and expand or fill uniform blocks consistently across rows/columns, often resulting in symmetric or repeating patterns like stacked rectangles.
 * Subtle elements include handling edges/corners differently (e.g., fewer neighbors), resolving ties in mode by favoring maximum values, and avoiding bleed-over between adjacent but distinct regions (e.g., a single outlier shouldn't propagate to dominate a whole block).
 * Transposition is used to reorient vertical structures horizontally for processing, but over-application of smoothing can blur boundaries or incorrectly fill regions (e.g., turning isolated noise into false extensions).
 * Patterns often involve decreasing or increasing value gradients vertically/horizontally, with some regions "growing" downward or rightward in the expectations.
 * Noise includes scattered single values or small clusters that should be overwritten by surrounding majorities, but smoothing must be directional or iterative to match exact block shapes.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 10x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; empty or zero values may represent backgrounds that should expand but not override foregrounds.
 * Iterative smoothing (multiple passes) might be needed for propagation, but single passes as in the attempt cause incomplete fills.
 * No rotation or scaling is evident; focus on local neighborhood consensus (e.g., 3x3 or linear neighbors) to build larger structures.

    if not lst:
        return 0
    count = Counter(lst)
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))

        smoothed[i] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return smoothed
```
(This is helpful for 1D denoising but insufficient alone; extend to 2D neighborhoods for better block preservation.)

def smooth_grid_vertical(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Smooths each column vertically by treating columns as rows and applying smooth_row.
    This rule handles vertical noise reduction, complementing horizontal smoothing.

    n_rows = len(g)
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    smoothed = [row[:] for row in g]
    for j in range(n_cols):
        col = [g[i][j] for i in range(n_rows)]
        smoothed_col = smooth_row(col)
        for i in range(n_rows):
            smoothed[i][j] = smoothed_col[i]
    return smoothed
```
(This complements row smoothing but causes over-smoothing in vertical directions, blurring expected sharp horizontal bands.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Transposes the grid, swapping rows and columns.
    This core transformation reorients the input to align vertical structures horizontally.
    """
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is potentially useful for handling asymmetric noise but in the attempt, applying it once before smoothing misaligns structures, leading to incorrect propagation.)

(No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; future attempts might need flood-fill or region-growing to identify and clean blocks explicitly, as simple neighbor mode doesn't capture connected components well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used transposition followed by horizontal row smoothing and then vertical column smoothing, aiming for noise reduction via local modes, but this over-smoothed and incorrectly propagated values across boundaries, failing to produce the blocky, uniform regions in expectations.
 * In Training 1, generated output created uniform top bands of 6/7/8 and bottom bands of 4/7/8 with scattered 9s, but expected clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0 with sharp vertical offsets (e.g., columns 11-13 as 3s, rest 7s in top; full 3s in middle; 0/3 in bottom)—the smoothing filled too much horizontally after transpose, ignoring vertical block integrity.
 * In Training 2, generated irregular bands of 7/8/3/5/9 with jagged edges (e.g., row 4 has 7s then 3s; row 9 has mixed 3/6), but expected structured blocks like top 6s, middle 3/8/6 bands, and bottom 3/8/9/7—transpose + smoothing created false vertical fills (e.g., 9s appearing where 6s should dominate).
 * In Training 3, generated mixed 6/4/3/8/5/9 with incomplete blocks (e.g., row 1 all 6/9; row 4 has 6/4/8), but expected top 5/3 bands, middle 7/8/6/3/6/4—smoothing failed to expand 3s leftward or align vertical columns properly, leaving noise like isolated 5s.
 * In Training 4, generated descending 2/6/3 bands with irregularities (e.g., row 5 has 2/1/6; row 7 has 3/6/3), but expected uniform top/middle/bottom 6/3/2 blocks with repeating rows—vertical smoothing overwrote horizontal patterns, creating false 1s and uneven fills.
 * No training sample passed, indicating the linear neighbor mode (only left/right or up/down) doesn't capture 2D locality well; needs fuller neighborhoods or region-based filling.
 * The compute_mode tie-breaker (max value) sometimes favors high numbers incorrectly (e.g., 9s over 6s in test), but it's not the core issue—lack of iteration or boundary detection is.
 * Transpose is helpful for reorientation but applying it rigidly without inverse or multiple steps misaligns outputs (e.g., expected patterns aren't transposed back).
 * Simple smoothing functions like smooth_row and smooth_grid_vertical are partially helpful for local noise but broken for global structure—they propagate too aggressively without respecting block connectivity, leading to smeared results; not sufficient alone, but could be built upon with iterations or masks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which might be essential for identifying dominant regions (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of same value and expand them); current approach treats all pixels equally, missing this.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it remains highly noisy with scattered values (e.g., isolated 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 8s, 9s in irregular clusters) and incomplete fills (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s/7s/8s; rows 14-24 show patchy 0/2/6/9/8 bands with jagged edges like single 7s or 4s), failing to form the clean, rectangular blocks seen in training expectations.
 * Unlike expectations' uniform horizontal bands (e.g., full rows of same value or clear column-wise shifts), the output has over-propagated 9s in corners/top and fragmented middle regions (e.g., 0s not fully expanding to background blocks; 2s forming small irregular shapes instead of solid areas), suggesting the transpose + dual smoothing smeared noise without resolving underlying structures.
 * It doesn't make sense as a cleaned puzzle—looks more like partially denoised input than a solved pattern (e.g., no coherent shapes like letters/symbols emerge; values like 4s and 7s appear as outliers where 9/6/8/0/3/2 should dominate blocks).
 * To handle test case, need to prevent boundary bleed (e.g., 9s invading 6/0 areas) and promote vertical consistency (e.g., expand 3s downward fully); current method's single-pass linear smoothing can't achieve this, as seen in persistent scatter.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a puzzle involving transforming input grids of integers (likely representing pixel colors or labels in a visual pattern) into output grids that simplify or correct the structure, emphasizing blocky, uniform regions while preserving distinct shapes and boundaries of "objects" or blobs, possibly through region filling, noise removal, or segmentation rules that propagate values selectively rather than uniformly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently show large uniform blocks of the same number (e.g., long stretches of 7s, 3s, or 9s), suggesting the goal is to expand or fill connected regions into rectangular or structured shapes, but without over-smoothing across unrelated areas.
 * Boundaries between regions must be sharp and respected; for example, in training example 1 expected output, there's a clear vertical stack of 7s on the right, with a thin 3-column band of 3s separating upper and lower sections, and a bottom band of 0s—generated output instead bleeds 6s and 4s incorrectly into these areas.
 * Grids may be non-square, and transposition is used in the program for dimension matching, but this seems to distort orientations; expected outputs maintain the input's row/column structure without flipping.
 * Iterative application is key for propagation, but the number of iterations (size//6 +1) is too aggressive or insufficient, leading to incomplete filling (e.g., in training example 2, generated has scattered 1s and 5s persisting, while expected has clean bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, and 9s).
 * Mode computation favors the maximum in ties, which may bias toward higher numbers (e.g., 9s dominating in test output), but expected outputs sometimes prioritize lower or specific values (e.g., 0s in example 1 bottom, 3s over others).
 * Edge handling in neighborhoods is basic (using available cells), but subtle: corners/edges should not leak values from distant regions; generated outputs show unwanted propagation (e.g., in example 3, 4s and 8s mix incorrectly, while expected has distinct horizontal bands and vertical alignments like 3s and 6s).
 * No global rules like thresholding or connectivity (e.g., 4-connected vs 8-connected) are applied; outputs suggest flood-fill-like behavior for blobs, but only within implied shapes—e.g., example 4 expected has repeating 6/3/2 bands vertically, but generated scatters 1s and uneven 6s.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve some asymmetry or "stair-step" boundaries (e.g., example 2 expected has 9s only in bottom-right), but smoothing erases them; also, empty or zero areas (like 0s in example 1) must remain as backgrounds, not filled.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), no object extraction is done—grids seem to contain multiple "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need individual processing, like identifying connected components before filling.
 * Considerations: Inputs may have noise (scattered single cells), which should be removed by majority in local regions, but not globally; test input has complex shapes (e.g., a large 9 background with embedded 3s, 0s, 2s, 6s, 4s, 7s, 8s), suggesting hierarchical filling where backgrounds expand but inner shapes hold.

    count = Counter(values)
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))

            new_g[i][j] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return new_g
```
(This is a core smoothing tool that works for local denoising but fails on global structure; useful as a building block, but needs integration with region detection.)

No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; a function like `extract_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]` (returning blobs) would be essential for isolating and filling shapes separately, as pure smoothing mixes everything.

The main `program` function combines transpose and iterative smoothing, which is a reasonable start for propagation but broken for boundary preservation—don't rely on it as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt uses iterative 2D mode-based smoothing after optional transpose, which partially works for expanding uniform regions (e.g., large 9 blocks in test output mimic background filling) but fails to preserve distinct blob shapes and introduces unwanted bleeding (e.g., 6s overwriting 0/3 areas).
 * Transposition for non-square grids mismatches orientations; in example 1 (12x16 input implied), it likely flips rows/columns, causing horizontal bands to become vertical incorrectly.
 * Smoothing iterations (size//6 +1) are too few or mismatched; example 2 generated leaves noise like 1s and 5s, while expected cleans to solid bands—propagation doesn't reach far enough or respects connectivity wrong.
 * Mode tie-breaking to max value biases high numbers (e.g., 8/9 dominating in example 3 generated vs. expected 3/6/4 bands).
 * No handling for background (0s) or specific value priorities; example 1 generated fills bottom with 4s instead of 0s, and upper with 6s instead of 7s.
 * Example 4 generated has uneven 6s and persistent 1s in a place expected to be clean 3s/2s, showing poor noise removal in sparse areas.
 * Overall, approach understands local majority but misses global rules like connected-component filling or shape recognition—e.g., all trainings have blocky, aligned rectangles in expected, but generated has jagged remnants.
 * Function `smooth_grid_2d` is helpful but incomplete (lacks connectivity); `transpose` may be irrelevant or harmful (don't use unless dimensions demand it); no unhelpful functions beyond that, but pure iteration without seeding or masking is not sufficient.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-smooths into massive 9/6/8/4/2/7 blocks with some jagged edges (e.g., scattered 0s and 2s in the middle persist partially, but large areas like the top-left 9s and bottom-right 4s expand too far), losing distinct embedded shapes like the 3-blob, 0-void, and 2-strip in the input.
 * It resembles aggressive denoising but ignores subtle boundaries—e.g., the input's vertical 3-column of 3s and horizontal 0/2 bands get partially erased into surrounding 9s/6s, while expected (inferred from trainings) should maintain clean, rectangular fills for each region without crossover (e.g., 0s as background voids, 2s as a thin inner strip).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats the error of bleeding values (like 9s overwriting 3s/7s), and the structure doesn't align to blocky patterns—e.g., the right-side 7/4 areas mix into 9s incorrectly; this suggests the program would fail if the test expected preserved object separations.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not grid:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return h, w
```
Basic grid dimensions utility, useful for bounds checking.

```python
def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Dict], List[Dict]]:
    # (Full implementation as in the program: BFS to find non-blue components and separately blue components)
    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Merging via positional adjacency or overlap**: Across all train examples, small components (e.g., Blue elements with pixels=1-5, single-pixel Green or Pink) have bboxes that are fully contained within, overlap, or are immediately adjacent to the bboxes of larger components (pixels>10, colors including Pink, Green, Yellow, Red/Dark Red, Maroon). In outputs, these small components are consistently absorbed into the larger ones, resulting in output bboxes that expand to encompass the input bboxes involved, and output pixel counts that equal the sum of the input pixel counts from the merged components (e.g., Train 4: Pink output pixels=21 sums Red=15 + Red=1 + Red=1 + Blue=4; Green output pixels=28 sums Pink=7 + Pink=12 + Pink=1 + Blue=4 + Blue=4). This interaction treats position (bbox) as the key connector for combining pixels regardless of input color.

- **Blue elements as absorbers/enablers**: Small Blue components (consistent properties: holes=0, pixels=1-5, often linear or inset based on narrow bbox dimensions like [x,x+1,y,y+1]) are present in every train input and are consistently merged into adjacent larger non-Blue components, contributing their pixels to the output pixel total without appearing as separate output elements (except Light Blue in Train 2, which is a distinct color variant). This suggests Blues interact via position to enable or facilitate merging but do not persist independently. No consistent color effect from Blues is observable (e.g., Train 4 top: Blue + Red → Pink output color; Train 4 right: Blue + Green → Red output color).

- **Color transformation independent of merging**: In every train example, some output components exhibit color changes from input colors even without pixel sum increases from merging (e.g., Train 4 bottom: Yellow input [0,7,6,9] pixels=21 → Pink output same bbox/pixels; Train 2: Orange input [5,8,7,9] pixels=6 → Light Blue output same bbox/pixels). The trigger for these transformations (e.g., specific position, bbox dimensions, or adjacency to other elements) is unknown and not consistently explainable from the data. Merged regions also show variable color outcomes (e.g., Pink + Blue → Green in Train 4 middle; Red + Blue → Pink in Train 4 top), with no obvious rule tying input colors/positions to output colors.

- **Green as a persistent hub**: Green components (larger ones with pixels>5) appear in every train input and output, consistently acting as a "hub" that either absorbs adjacent small elements (e.g., Train 1: output Green bbox [0,0,12,11] encompasses multiple input Yellow/Pink/Blue/Green positions) or maintains/expands its bbox to include them (e.g., Train 4: Green output [0,3,6,6] covers input Pink/Blue positions). Pixel increases for Green outputs always match summed adjacent inputs, indicating consistent positional interaction favoring Green expansion.

- **Irrelevant or non-interacting elements**: Small non-Green, non-Blue single-pixel elements (e.g., isolated Dark Red pixels=1 in Train 1/2) do not consistently interact or merge across examples and are often absorbed without affecting output color predictably; their role is unknown if not positionally tied to larger blocks. Light Blue appears sporadically (Trains 1-3 inputs) but only persists in one output (Train 2), with no consistent interaction pattern. Orange (Train 2/3) merges positionally like other colors but changes to other colors (e.g., to Light Blue), with transformation unknown. No consistent interactions involve holes (all=0 in trains), silhouettes, or movement effects beyond bbox expansion.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:55:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several useful building blocks for component detection and manipulation, though some need refinement for order/conditions.

```python

    # Correctly identifies 4-way connected same-color regions, tracks visited to avoid duplicates.
    # Helpful for initial extraction; works well as a base.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-10-03 15:55:29] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all 4 train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case (e.g., via position, embedding, adjacency, or transformation effects on bbox, pixels, or color). I focused only on consistent patterns; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone 1-pixel shapes without adjacency to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Where a full explanation of a transformation cannot be determined from the data (e.g., exact pixel recalculation mechanics), it is noted as unknown. Connections are described with supporting evidence from the trains.

1. **Small blue shapes (pixels=1 or 4, bbox typically 1x1 or 2x2) embedded within or adjacent to larger non-blue blocks consistently affect the bbox expansion or contraction of those larger blocks in outputs**:
   - In every input, multiple small blue components are positioned inside or directly bordering larger blocks (e.g., input 1: blues at [6,6,7,8] and [9,3,11,5] area overlapping yellow/pink bboxes; input 2: blues at [3,3,4,5] and [1,5,2,7] within maroon/dark red areas; input 3: blues at [6,3,8,4] and [4,6,5,8] inside yellow/pink; input 4: blues at [3,3,5,4] and [0,5,2,6] inside pink/green).
   - In every output, these small blues are absent, and the host larger block's bbox is modified (often expanded in one dimension or shifted): e.g., train 1 pink [0,0,4,9] + embedded blues → contributes to green [0,0,12,11] (x expanded from 4 to 12); train 2 maroon [0,3,2,9] + adjacent blues → maroon [3,3,4,9] (x shifted right, y unchanged); train 3 yellow [3,3,8,9] + embedded blues → yellow [11,3,13,8] (x shifted right, y contracted); train 4 green [7,0,9,9] unaffected directly but bbox unchanged while adjacent pink contracts.
   - Effect: Consistent bbox adjustment (no outputs retain original small blue bboxes), suggesting positional embedding triggers structural change. Pixel count of host block decreases slightly in 3/4 cases (unknown exact subtraction mechanism).

2. **Adjacency between pink and yellow blocks consistently leads to partial merging or color transformation into a single larger green (or adjusted pink/yellow) component in outputs**:
   - In every input with both colors, pink and yellow bboxes are adjacent or overlapping in y-range (e.g., input 1: pink [0,0,4,9] adjacent to yellow [8,0,11,9]; input 3: pink [0,0,3,8] directly borders yellow [3,3,8,9]; input 4: pink [0,3,3,4] and [2,3,6,6] adjacent to yellow [0,7,6,9] in lower area; input 2 lacks yellow but has pink adjacent to green, following similar merge pattern).
   - In every output, they interact to form a combined or transformed structure: e.g., train 1 → green [0,0,12,11] (bbox unions both, color changes to green, pixels=66 ≈46+35-15 unknown loss); train 3 → pink [4,3,10,8] (bbox bridges both originals, pixels=33 > original pink 30 but < sum); train 4 → green [0,3,6,6] (emerges from pink/yellow adjacency, pixels=28 ≈12+21-5 unknown); train 2 pink [9,4,9,4] adjacent to green → contributes to larger pink [0,0,7,7].
   - Effect: Positional adjacency (shared y-range, x-bordering) triggers merge/transformation. Color change to green occurs in 2/4 cases (pink+yellow → green); unknown why not consistent across all.

3. **Dark red (or red) components consistently interact with adjacent maroon or green blocks via position, leading to bbox splitting or relocation with preserved pixel count**:
   - In every input, dark red/red has a large central bbox adjacent to maroon or green (e.g., input 1: dark red [0,0,11,12] borders maroon [0,13,11,15] in y; input 2: dark red [0,0,7,5] adjacent to maroon [0,3,2,9]; input 3: no explicit dark red large, but small dark red [7,11,7,11] near maroon [3,10,8,12]; input 4: red [0,0,4,2] and [6,0,6,0] adjacent to green [7,0,9,9]).
   - In every output, this results in dark red/red bboxes being split or shifted while retaining similar total pixels: e.g., train 1 dark red 53+1=54 input → two dark reds 40+36=76 (pixels increase unknown); but second dark red [13,0,15,11] pixels=36 matches maroon input 36, bbox relocated right; train 2 dark red 28+1+1=30 → dark red [8,0,9,9]20 (contracted x, adjacent to output maroon [3,3,4,9]14); train 3 → dark red [0,3,0,8]6 (thin split from maroon adjacency); train 4 red 15+1+1=17 → red [7,0,9,9]30 (expanded x to match green adjacency).
   - Effect: Positional adjacency (overlapping or bordering y, x-offset) causes bbox relocation/splitting. Pixel count often preserved or slightly adjusted (unknown if due to absorption from adjacent).

4. **Small green shapes (pixels=1-12, isolated or embedded) consistently contribute to larger green bbox expansion in outputs when adjacent to blue or other greens**:
   - In every input, small greens are near small blues or other greens (e.g., input 1: green [3,3,3,3]1 adjacent to blues at [3,2,3,2] and [3,4,3,4]; input 2: greens [8,0,9,3]7, [3,3,3,3]1, [3,5,4,9]9, [8,5,9,9]9 adjacent to blues; input 3: greens [3,0,3,0]1, [5,0,8,2]12, [3,2,3,2]1 near blues [3,0,4,2]; input 4: no small green, but large green [7,0,9,9]26 adjacent to blues).
   - In every output, they merge into a single large green with expanded bbox covering the originals + adjacent areas: e.g., train 1 small green1 → green [0,0,12,11]66 (massive x/y expansion); train 2 multiple small greens total ~26 → green [0,3,2,9]21 (y preserved, x contracted but covers originals); train 3 small greens ~14 → green [5,0,13,5]36 (x expanded right, y to 5); train 4 large green26 → green [0,3,6,6]28 (x left-shifted, y contracted).
   - Effect: Adjacency to small blues triggers expansion (bbox grows in at least one dimension consistently). Pixel increase in 3/4 cases (unknown source; possibly absorbs from adjacent non-greens).

5. **Holes property (always 0 in trains) remains unchanged (holes=0) in all output components, with no interaction observed**:
   - Consistent across all inputs/outputs: no holes present, so no effect on other properties like bbox or pixels. (Note: test inputs have holes=1 in some, but this is outside train consistency.)

### Unknowns / Non-Consistent Interactions Noted
- Pixel count transformations: Outputs consistently have fewer total pixels than input non-blues (e.g., train 1: ~177 non-blue input pixels → 142 output; train 2: ~50+ non-blue → 100? rough, but reduced overall), but exact mechanism (e.g., subtraction beyond blues, overlap resolution) is unknown and not consistent in pattern (sometimes increase, e.g., train 4 reds 17→30).
- Color-specific changes beyond pink/yellow→green (e.g., orange/light blue in some inputs absent in outputs; maroon→dark red relocation in train 1): Occurs but not in every example, so not listed as consistent.
- Irregular outlines or circular elements (mentioned in descriptions): No data on edges/holes/silhouettes in the provided lists (all holes=0, no shape type beyond bbox), so no identifiable interaction; cannot confirm consistency without visual data.
- Position→color effects beyond listed: Some bboxes shift without clear color link (e.g., train 3 orange [0,9,2,9]3 input → orange [0,0,4,2]15 output, pixels tripled, unknown trigger).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., involving light blue, orange, or black specifically) appear across every train example. Irrelevant elements like isolated 1-pixel non-adjacent shapes were ignored.

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected regions) that must be transformed according to specific pattern-based rules, producing output grids with large uniform blocks or stripes of numbers, often filling or outlining detected structures like blobs or lines. The goal is to recognize and manipulate connected components or regions in the input to match structured, repetitive expected outputs, rather than simple operations like transposition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain scattered numbers (0-9) forming irregular patterns or "blobs" of connected same-valued cells (likely 4-connected or 8-connected), and the output reinterprets these into horizontal bands or blocks of uniform values, suggesting rules for grouping, filling, or mirroring regions.
 * Outputs often feature repeating rows of the same pattern (e.g., entire rows of 7s with a small block of 3s in specific columns), indicating vertical symmetry or replication across rows, but with transitions between block types (e.g., from 7s to 3s to 0s) based on input structure.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have jagged edges or isolated cells (e.g., single 1s or small clusters), but outputs simplify them into clean rectangular blocks, possibly by expanding, contracting, or selecting dominant values per "layer" or section.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so rules must be size-agnostic; outputs preserve dimensions but reorganize content.
 * Connected components seem key: inputs show clusters (e.g., 3s forming shapes), outputs map them to filled regions (e.g., all 3s become a horizontal stripe across multiple rows).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the max key (may need adjustment for puzzle ties).
    Helpful for identifying dominant values in columns, but insufficient alone—needs integration with filling logic.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```

```python
def group_columns(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[tuple]:
    """
    Groups consecutive columns by their mode, returning list of (mode, width) tuples.
    Useful for detecting vertical strips of similar columns (e.g., in training 1, might group cols with mode 7).
    However, broken for the puzzle as it doesn't handle row-wise filling or horizontal blocks in expected outputs—don't use as core logic without major changes.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []
    i = 0
    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups
```

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where scattered or patterned numbers in an input grid are resolved into structured blocks or bands of uniform values, likely based on dominance, frequency, or regional grouping rules rather than global uniform filling. The goal appears to be creating clean, horizontal or block-like patterns that preserve some aspects of the original structure, such as partial extensions or transitions between values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The transformation seems to involve identifying horizontal bands or rows/sections where a dominant value (possibly mode or majority) fills most of the space, but with subtle extensions or overrides in specific columns (e.g., in training example 1, 7s extend into the right side of 3 and 0 blocks, and 3s appear in a middle band with partial 7s).
 * Not all rows become fully uniform; instead, patterns show vertical consistency in columns while allowing horizontal segmentation (e.g., training example 2 has repeating rows with mixed blocks like 6s transitioning to 7s or 9s in specific positions, not full-row fills).
 * Ties in frequency or modes may favor certain values (e.g., maximum value in ties, as attempted), but the rule isn't purely row/column mode— it might require regional analysis, like connected components or blobs of similar values.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs often repeat the same row pattern multiple times vertically (e.g., 4 identical rows of a pattern in example 1), suggesting vertical stacking or propagation of horizontal decisions; transitions between blocks aren't abrupt but can have overlaps (e.g., example 3 has mixed values in middle rows before uniform 6s and 4s).
 * Potential for "scattered patterns" to simplify into "clean horizontal bands," but not via simple transpose-and-fill, as that loses positional details like the 3s interrupting 7s in example 1.
 * No evidence of rotation, mirroring, or non-numeric operations; focus on integer values (0-9) and their grouping.
 * Easy to miss: The output preserves some original positional relationships (e.g., right-side columns in example 1 keep 7s across changing bands), and not everything is filled uniformly—minority values can dominate in sub-regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for analyzing columns if the rule involves vertical dominance, but over-reliance leads to errors as seen.)

```python
def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This handles frequency-based decisions with tie-breaking, which aligns with potential dominance rules, but needs adaptation for regions, not full rows/columns.)

```python
def fill_row_with_mode(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fills a row with its computed mode value.
    Handles the transformation rule of uniform filling based on row dominance.
    """
    mode = compute_mode(row)
    return [mode for _ in row]
```
(This simplifies patterns to uniforms, which partially captures "clean bands" but fails on partial fills and positional preservation; not sufficient alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used transpose then mode-fill on transposed rows, creating fully uniform horizontal bands in the output (e.g., entire rows of 6s, 7s, 4s in training 1), which worked for simplifying scattered values into blocks but failed to preserve mixed patterns like the 3s interrupting 7s or the right-side 7 extensions in training example 1.
 * In training example 1, generated all-6s (top), all-7s (middle), all-4s (bottom) blocks, but expected has vertical repetition of mixed rows (e.g., 7s with partial 3s and 7s on right, then 3s with 7s on right, then 0s with 3s and 7s), so it over-uniformized and ignored column-specific propagations.
 * Training example 2 generated stacked uniform rows (8s, 3s, 7s, etc.), but expected has repeating mixed blocks (e.g., 6s transitioning to 7s on right, with 8s and 9s in middle sections), missing horizontal segmentation and vertical consistency in sub-columns.
 * Training example 3 generated uniform 6s and 4s blocks with a single 1s row, but expected has top uniform 5s/3s bands transitioning to mixed middle rows (7/8/6/3/6/4 patterns) before uniform bottoms, so it collapsed diverse middle rows incorrectly.
 * Training example 4 generated scattered uniform rows (6s, 4s, 1s, 3s), but expected has repeating 6/2 and 3/2 blocks vertically, indicating failure to group and propagate patterns across multiple rows.
 * Transpose was helpful for column analysis but combined with full-row fill made outputs too simplistic, losing regional details; compute_mode is relevant for dominance but needs per-segment application, not whole rows.
 * No object extraction functions were used or proposed, but the puzzle might benefit from identifying "blobs" or connected regions of values (unexplored so far); fill_row_with_mode is partially helpful for uniform bands but broken for mixed rows—don't use it without segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it consists of fully uniform long rows (30 elements each) of single values (9s, 6s, 0s, 2s, 4s) stacked vertically into large blocks, which mirrors the over-simplification seen in training examples and ignores likely mixed or segmented patterns.
 * It generates a top row of all 9s (unusual, as inputs probably don't have such dominance), then blocks of 6s (3 rows), 0s (4 rows), 9s (4 rows), 0s (1 row), 9s (1 row), 2s (8 rows), 9s (4 rows), 4s (4 rows), suggesting the transpose-mode-fill blindly propagated column modes without considering horizontal variations or regional rules.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected outputs from training show repeated but mixed rows (e.g., partial fills in columns), not monolithic blocks; it likely mismatches by not handling transitions or sub-regions, making the output too uniform and grid-filling without subtlety.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of input grids composed of colored blocks (integers 0-9 representing colors or background) into output grids through rules like filling holes, expanding or repositioning small shapes, resolving overlaps, and possibly rotating or resizing the grid to match output patterns. The goal is to identify and apply consistent rules across examples to produce structured block arrangements in the outputs, often simplifying or reorganizing components while preserving dominant colors and shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small blue shapes (1's, 1-4 pixels) appear embedded or adjacent to larger blocks and are filled by the nearest non-1 color using flood-fill (BFS), but this must be precise to avoid over-filling or altering large blocks unexpectedly.
 * Positional overlaps in larger blocks are resolved by dominance, such as taking the max color in a local neighborhood, but this can lead to uniform spreading if not bounded correctly; subtle overlaps may require component-based merging rather than local max.
 * Small non-blue shapes (e.g., 3's, 9's with <5 pixels) are expanded into adjacent larger blocks or repositioned, but expansions should be limited and directionally aware (e.g., toward dominant areas) to avoid infinite growth or incorrect absorption.
 * Maroon blocks (8's) tend to migrate to bottom or side positions in outputs, suggesting a repositioning rule like shifting to lower rows/columns, but this must account for grid size changes and avoid overwriting other elements.
 * Light blue (9's, small and nested) may emerge or expand inward from enclosures, checking for uniform surrounding colors, but only if fully nested (all 4 directions same non-9); partial nesting or edge cases can break this.
 * Outputs often have consistent dimensions or transpositions (e.g., rotating the grid), with blocks stretching vertically/horizontally; background (0's) fills unused areas, and small components may disappear or merge entirely.
 * Color counts and connectivity matter: large components (>5 pixels) dominate, small ones are absorbed or moved; 4-connectivity for floods, but 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonals in some shapes.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., inputs 10x10 to 30x?, outputs rectangular blocks), so rules must handle padding with 0's and potential transposition/resize at the end.
 * Subtle: Some colors like 3's or 9's invert positions (top to bottom), 8's cluster at edges; avoid assuming all small shapes behave the same—9's may stay nested while 3's expand/merge.
 * All examples show simplification: complex nested inputs become layered horizontal/vertical bands of colors, with no isolated small pixels in outputs.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program applies a sequence of filling, adjustment, expansion, repositioning, enclosure handling, and transpose, but all training examples failed, indicating over-application or incorrect order of rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated large top blocks of 6/7 with misplaced 9's/4's/8's at bottom, but expected vertical bands of 7/3 with 0's filling lower areas; missed repositioning 3's to mid-bottom and eliminating small 4/9 intrusions, over-expanded 8's incorrectly.
 * Training example 2: Generated scattered 7/8/6/3 with misplaced 5's, but expected structured 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 layers; failed to merge small 3's into bands, incorrectly positioned 8's and introduced non-existent 5's (likely from bad adjustment).
 * Training example 3: Generated horizontal 6/9/3/4/8 bands with 0's, but expected mixed 5/3/7/8/6/4 layers; incorrectly introduced 5's (not in input?) and failed to create the specific vertical stacking with 3's dominating mid-section.
 * Training example 4: Generated vertical 2/6/3/4 bands, but expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers with 2's at right; missed horizontal reorganization and stretching of 6's across rows.
 * handle_position_color_adjustment (max in 3x3) caused unwanted spreading (e.g., uniform 7's in ex1), not helpful—replace with component merging.
 * expand_small_non_blue over-expands without proper limits or directionality, leading to blob distortion (e.g., small 3's overtaking areas in ex2); broken for large grids.
 * reposition_maroon_blocks moves 8's arbitrarily without preserving counts or avoiding overlaps, causing bottom clutter (ex1); not helpful as is—needs target position calculation based on output patterns.
 * handle_light_blue_enclosure checks nesting but expands outward incorrectly, creating artifacts (e.g., 9's leaking in ex1); subtle nesting detection misses edges, making it unreliable.
 * Overall, sequence starts with filling (somewhat correct for 1's) but cascades errors; no object extraction, so rules apply pixel-wise instead of shape-wise, missing connected components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid (inferred from rows) with messy, irregular bands of 9's dominating left/top, interspersed with 6's, 3's, 2's, 8's, and scattered 0's/7's/4's, lacking the clean horizontal/vertical block structure seen in expected training outputs.
 * It does not look correct: Expected outputs have uniform, stretched color bands (e.g., full-row 7's or 6's with sharp transitions), but this has jagged edges, isolated pixels (e.g., single 7's), and over-proliferated 9's/8's without clear layering; likely from faulty filling/expansion propagating errors across the large input.
 * Missing simplification: Input has complex nesting (3's in 9's, 2's in 0's, 8's at bottom-right), but output should resolve to banded layers (e.g., 9's as background enclosure, 6's as mid-band, 2's/3's repositioned); instead, it retains too much input chaos.
 * Does not match test considerations: Large size suggests need for scalable rules (e.g., component sizes), but output has uneven 0-fills and misplaced small colors (4's/7's appearing erroneously), indicating broken color propagation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers that appear to represent noisy images or patterns (e.g., blocky shapes or regions of uniform values like letters, numbers, or symbols), where the task is to apply transformations to denoise or clean the input grid, revealing coherent, structured blocks of identical values as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The inputs are noisy versions of structured grids with rectangular or block-like regions of the same number (e.g., large uniform areas separated by boundaries), and the goal is to propagate dominant values across regions while suppressing outliers or noise without over-smoothing across distinct boundaries.
 * Expected outputs preserve sharp edges between different regions (e.g., horizontal/vertical lines of transition) and expand or fill uniform blocks consistently across rows/columns, often resulting in symmetric or repeating patterns like stacked rectangles.
 * Subtle elements include handling edges/corners differently (e.g., fewer neighbors), resolving ties in mode by favoring maximum values, and avoiding bleed-over between adjacent but distinct regions (e.g., a single outlier shouldn't propagate to dominate a whole block).
 * Transposition is used to reorient vertical structures horizontally for processing, but over-application of smoothing can blur boundaries or incorrectly fill regions (e.g., turning isolated noise into false extensions).
 * Patterns often involve decreasing or increasing value gradients vertically/horizontally, with some regions "growing" downward or rightward in the expectations.
 * Noise includes scattered single values or small clusters that should be overwritten by surrounding majorities, but smoothing must be directional or iterative to match exact block shapes.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 10x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; empty or zero values may represent backgrounds that should expand but not override foregrounds.
 * Iterative smoothing (multiple passes) might be needed for propagation, but single passes as in the attempt cause incomplete fills.
 * No rotation or scaling is evident; focus on local neighborhood consensus (e.g., 3x3 or linear neighbors) to build larger structures.

```
(This is potentially useful for handling asymmetric noise but in the attempt, applying it once before smoothing misaligns structures, leading to incorrect propagation.)

(No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; future attempts might need flood-fill or region-growing to identify and clean blocks explicitly, as simple neighbor mode doesn't capture connected components well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used transposition followed by horizontal row smoothing and then vertical column smoothing, aiming for noise reduction via local modes, but this over-smoothed and incorrectly propagated values across boundaries, failing to produce the blocky, uniform regions in expectations.
 * In Training 1, generated output created uniform top bands of 6/7/8 and bottom bands of 4/7/8 with scattered 9s, but expected clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0 with sharp vertical offsets (e.g., columns 11-13 as 3s, rest 7s in top; full 3s in middle; 0/3 in bottom)—the smoothing filled too much horizontally after transpose, ignoring vertical block integrity.
 * In Training 2, generated irregular bands of 7/8/3/5/9 with jagged edges (e.g., row 4 has 7s then 3s; row 9 has mixed 3/6), but expected structured blocks like top 6s, middle 3/8/6 bands, and bottom 3/8/9/7—transpose + smoothing created false vertical fills (e.g., 9s appearing where 6s should dominate).
 * In Training 3, generated mixed 6/4/3/8/5/9 with incomplete blocks (e.g., row 1 all 6/9; row 4 has 6/4/8), but expected top 5/3 bands, middle 7/8/6/3/6/4—smoothing failed to expand 3s leftward or align vertical columns properly, leaving noise like isolated 5s.
 * In Training 4, generated descending 2/6/3 bands with irregularities (e.g., row 5 has 2/1/6; row 7 has 3/6/3), but expected uniform top/middle/bottom 6/3/2 blocks with repeating rows—vertical smoothing overwrote horizontal patterns, creating false 1s and uneven fills.
 * No training sample passed, indicating the linear neighbor mode (only left/right or up/down) doesn't capture 2D locality well; needs fuller neighborhoods or region-based filling.
 * The compute_mode tie-breaker (max value) sometimes favors high numbers incorrectly (e.g., 9s over 6s in test), but it's not the core issue—lack of iteration or boundary detection is.
 * Transpose is helpful for reorientation but applying it rigidly without inverse or multiple steps misaligns outputs (e.g., expected patterns aren't transposed back).
 * Simple smoothing functions like smooth_row and smooth_grid_vertical are partially helpful for local noise but broken for global structure—they propagate too aggressively without respecting block connectivity, leading to smeared results; not sufficient alone, but could be built upon with iterations or masks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which might be essential for identifying dominant regions (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of same value and expand them); current approach treats all pixels equally, missing this.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it remains highly noisy with scattered values (e.g., isolated 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 8s, 9s in irregular clusters) and incomplete fills (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s/7s/8s; rows 14-24 show patchy 0/2/6/9/8 bands with jagged edges like single 7s or 4s), failing to form the clean, rectangular blocks seen in training expectations.
 * Unlike expectations' uniform horizontal bands (e.g., full rows of same value or clear column-wise shifts), the output has over-propagated 9s in corners/top and fragmented middle regions (e.g., 0s not fully expanding to background blocks; 2s forming small irregular shapes instead of solid areas), suggesting the transpose + dual smoothing smeared noise without resolving underlying structures.
 * It doesn't make sense as a cleaned puzzle—looks more like partially denoised input than a solved pattern (e.g., no coherent shapes like letters/symbols emerge; values like 4s and 7s appear as outliers where 9/6/8/0/3/2 should dominate blocks).
 * To handle test case, need to prevent boundary bleed (e.g., 9s invading 6/0 areas) and promote vertical consistency (e.g., expand 3s downward fully); current method's single-pass linear smoothing can't achieve this, as seen in persistent scatter.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a puzzle involving transforming input grids of integers (likely representing pixel colors or labels in a visual pattern) into output grids that simplify or correct the structure, emphasizing blocky, uniform regions while preserving distinct shapes and boundaries of "objects" or blobs, possibly through region filling, noise removal, or segmentation rules that propagate values selectively rather than uniformly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently show large uniform blocks of the same number (e.g., long stretches of 7s, 3s, or 9s), suggesting the goal is to expand or fill connected regions into rectangular or structured shapes, but without over-smoothing across unrelated areas.
 * Boundaries between regions must be sharp and respected; for example, in training example 1 expected output, there's a clear vertical stack of 7s on the right, with a thin 3-column band of 3s separating upper and lower sections, and a bottom band of 0s—generated output instead bleeds 6s and 4s incorrectly into these areas.
 * Grids may be non-square, and transposition is used in the program for dimension matching, but this seems to distort orientations; expected outputs maintain the input's row/column structure without flipping.
 * Iterative application is key for propagation, but the number of iterations (size//6 +1) is too aggressive or insufficient, leading to incomplete filling (e.g., in training example 2, generated has scattered 1s and 5s persisting, while expected has clean bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, and 9s).
 * Mode computation favors the maximum in ties, which may bias toward higher numbers (e.g., 9s dominating in test output), but expected outputs sometimes prioritize lower or specific values (e.g., 0s in example 1 bottom, 3s over others).
 * Edge handling in neighborhoods is basic (using available cells), but subtle: corners/edges should not leak values from distant regions; generated outputs show unwanted propagation (e.g., in example 3, 4s and 8s mix incorrectly, while expected has distinct horizontal bands and vertical alignments like 3s and 6s).
 * No global rules like thresholding or connectivity (e.g., 4-connected vs 8-connected) are applied; outputs suggest flood-fill-like behavior for blobs, but only within implied shapes—e.g., example 4 expected has repeating 6/3/2 bands vertically, but generated scatters 1s and uneven 6s.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve some asymmetry or "stair-step" boundaries (e.g., example 2 expected has 9s only in bottom-right), but smoothing erases them; also, empty or zero areas (like 0s in example 1) must remain as backgrounds, not filled.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), no object extraction is done—grids seem to contain multiple "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need individual processing, like identifying connected components before filling.
 * Considerations: Inputs may have noise (scattered single cells), which should be removed by majority in local regions, but not globally; test input has complex shapes (e.g., a large 9 background with embedded 3s, 0s, 2s, 6s, 4s, 7s, 8s), suggesting hierarchical filling where backgrounds expand but inner shapes hold.

    return new_g
```
(This is a core smoothing tool that works for local denoising but fails on global structure; useful as a building block, but needs integration with region detection.)

No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; a function like `extract_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]` (returning blobs) would be essential for isolating and filling shapes separately, as pure smoothing mixes everything.

The main `program` function combines transpose and iterative smoothing, which is a reasonable start for propagation but broken for boundary preservation—don't rely on it as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt uses iterative 2D mode-based smoothing after optional transpose, which partially works for expanding uniform regions (e.g., large 9 blocks in test output mimic background filling) but fails to preserve distinct blob shapes and introduces unwanted bleeding (e.g., 6s overwriting 0/3 areas).
 * Transposition for non-square grids mismatches orientations; in example 1 (12x16 input implied), it likely flips rows/columns, causing horizontal bands to become vertical incorrectly.
 * Smoothing iterations (size//6 +1) are too few or mismatched; example 2 generated leaves noise like 1s and 5s, while expected cleans to solid bands—propagation doesn't reach far enough or respects connectivity wrong.
 * Mode tie-breaking to max value biases high numbers (e.g., 8/9 dominating in example 3 generated vs. expected 3/6/4 bands).
 * No handling for background (0s) or specific value priorities; example 1 generated fills bottom with 4s instead of 0s, and upper with 6s instead of 7s.
 * Example 4 generated has uneven 6s and persistent 1s in a place expected to be clean 3s/2s, showing poor noise removal in sparse areas.
 * Overall, approach understands local majority but misses global rules like connected-component filling or shape recognition—e.g., all trainings have blocky, aligned rectangles in expected, but generated has jagged remnants.
 * Function `smooth_grid_2d` is helpful but incomplete (lacks connectivity); `transpose` may be irrelevant or harmful (don't use unless dimensions demand it); no unhelpful functions beyond that, but pure iteration without seeding or masking is not sufficient.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-smooths into massive 9/6/8/4/2/7 blocks with some jagged edges (e.g., scattered 0s and 2s in the middle persist partially, but large areas like the top-left 9s and bottom-right 4s expand too far), losing distinct embedded shapes like the 3-blob, 0-void, and 2-strip in the input.
 * It resembles aggressive denoising but ignores subtle boundaries—e.g., the input's vertical 3-column of 3s and horizontal 0/2 bands get partially erased into surrounding 9s/6s, while expected (inferred from trainings) should maintain clean, rectangular fills for each region without crossover (e.g., 0s as background voids, 2s as a thin inner strip).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats the error of bleeding values (like 9s overwriting 3s/7s), and the structure doesn't align to blocky patterns—e.g., the right-side 7/4 areas mix into 9s incorrectly; this suggests the program would fail if the test expected preserved object separations.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
The provided code includes several useful building blocks for component detection and manipulation, though some need refinement for order/conditions.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs, below is a list of obvious, consistent interactions or connections between elements across **all 4 train examples**. These are limited to properties or components that demonstrably interact or affect each other in every case (e.g., via position, embedding, adjacency, or transformation effects on bbox, pixels, or color). I focused only on consistent patterns; irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone 1-pixel shapes without adjacency to others) are excluded. No high-level puzzle solution is inferred or provided. Where a full explanation of a transformation cannot be determined from the data (e.g., exact pixel recalculation mechanics), it is noted as unknown. Connections are described with supporting evidence from the trains.

1. **Small blue shapes (pixels=1 or 4, bbox typically 1x1 or 2x2) embedded within or adjacent to larger non-blue blocks consistently affect the bbox expansion or contraction of those larger blocks in outputs**:
   - In every input, multiple small blue components are positioned inside or directly bordering larger blocks (e.g., input 1: blues at [6,6,7,8] and [9,3,11,5] area overlapping yellow/pink bboxes; input 2: blues at [3,3,4,5] and [1,5,2,7] within maroon/dark red areas; input 3: blues at [6,3,8,4] and [4,6,5,8] inside yellow/pink; input 4: blues at [3,3,5,4] and [0,5,2,6] inside pink/green).
   - In every output, these small blues are absent, and the host larger block's bbox is modified (often expanded in one dimension or shifted): e.g., train 1 pink [0,0,4,9] + embedded blues → contributes to green [0,0,12,11] (x expanded from 4 to 12); train 2 maroon [0,3,2,9] + adjacent blues → maroon [3,3,4,9] (x shifted right, y unchanged); train 3 yellow [3,3,8,9] + embedded blues → yellow [11,3,13,8] (x shifted right, y contracted); train 4 green [7,0,9,9] unaffected directly but bbox unchanged while adjacent pink contracts.
   - Effect: Consistent bbox adjustment (no outputs retain original small blue bboxes), suggesting positional embedding triggers structural change. Pixel count of host block decreases slightly in 3/4 cases (unknown exact subtraction mechanism).

2. **Adjacency between pink and yellow blocks consistently leads to partial merging or color transformation into a single larger green (or adjusted pink/yellow) component in outputs**:
   - In every input with both colors, pink and yellow bboxes are adjacent or overlapping in y-range (e.g., input 1: pink [0,0,4,9] adjacent to yellow [8,0,11,9]; input 3: pink [0,0,3,8] directly borders yellow [3,3,8,9]; input 4: pink [0,3,3,4] and [2,3,6,6] adjacent to yellow [0,7,6,9] in lower area; input 2 lacks yellow but has pink adjacent to green, following similar merge pattern).
   - In every output, they interact to form a combined or transformed structure: e.g., train 1 → green [0,0,12,11] (bbox unions both, color changes to green, pixels=66 ≈46+35-15 unknown loss); train 3 → pink [4,3,10,8] (bbox bridges both originals, pixels=33 > original pink 30 but < sum); train 4 → green [0,3,6,6] (emerges from pink/yellow adjacency, pixels=28 ≈12+21-5 unknown); train 2 pink [9,4,9,4] adjacent to green → contributes to larger pink [0,0,7,7].
   - Effect: Positional adjacency (shared y-range, x-bordering) triggers merge/transformation. Color change to green occurs in 2/4 cases (pink+yellow → green); unknown why not consistent across all.

3. **Dark red (or red) components consistently interact with adjacent maroon or green blocks via position, leading to bbox splitting or relocation with preserved pixel count**:
   - In every input, dark red/red has a large central bbox adjacent to maroon or green (e.g., input 1: dark red [0,0,11,12] borders maroon [0,13,11,15] in y; input 2: dark red [0,0,7,5] adjacent to maroon [0,3,2,9]; input 3: no explicit dark red large, but small dark red [7,11,7,11] near maroon [3,10,8,12]; input 4: red [0,0,4,2] and [6,0,6,0] adjacent to green [7,0,9,9]).
   - In every output, this results in dark red/red bboxes being split or shifted while retaining similar total pixels: e.g., train 1 dark red 53+1=54 input → two dark reds 40+36=76 (pixels increase unknown); but second dark red [13,0,15,11] pixels=36 matches maroon input 36, bbox relocated right; train 2 dark red 28+1+1=30 → dark red [8,0,9,9]20 (contracted x, adjacent to output maroon [3,3,4,9]14); train 3 → dark red [0,3,0,8]6 (thin split from maroon adjacency); train 4 red 15+1+1=17 → red [7,0,9,9]30 (expanded x to match green adjacency).
   - Effect: Positional adjacency (overlapping or bordering y, x-offset) causes bbox relocation/splitting. Pixel count often preserved or slightly adjusted (unknown if due to absorption from adjacent).

4. **Small green shapes (pixels=1-12, isolated or embedded) consistently contribute to larger green bbox expansion in outputs when adjacent to blue or other greens**:
   - In every input, small greens are near small blues or other greens (e.g., input 1: green [3,3,3,3]1 adjacent to blues at [3,2,3,2] and [3,4,3,4]; input 2: greens [8,0,9,3]7, [3,3,3,3]1, [3,5,4,9]9, [8,5,9,9]9 adjacent to blues; input 3: greens [3,0,3,0]1, [5,0,8,2]12, [3,2,3,2]1 near blues [3,0,4,2]; input 4: no small green, but large green [7,0,9,9]26 adjacent to blues).
   - In every output, they merge into a single large green with expanded bbox covering the originals + adjacent areas: e.g., train 1 small green1 → green [0,0,12,11]66 (massive x/y expansion); train 2 multiple small greens total ~26 → green [0,3,2,9]21 (y preserved, x contracted but covers originals); train 3 small greens ~14 → green [5,0,13,5]36 (x expanded right, y to 5); train 4 large green26 → green [0,3,6,6]28 (x left-shifted, y contracted).
   - Effect: Adjacency to small blues triggers expansion (bbox grows in at least one dimension consistently). Pixel increase in 3/4 cases (unknown source; possibly absorbs from adjacent non-greens).

5. **Holes property (always 0 in trains) remains unchanged (holes=0) in all output components, with no interaction observed**:
   - Consistent across all inputs/outputs: no holes present, so no effect on other properties like bbox or pixels. (Note: test inputs have holes=1 in some, but this is outside train consistency.)

### Unknowns / Non-Consistent Interactions Noted
- Pixel count transformations: Outputs consistently have fewer total pixels than input non-blues (e.g., train 1: ~177 non-blue input pixels → 142 output; train 2: ~50+ non-blue → 100? rough, but reduced overall), but exact mechanism (e.g., subtraction beyond blues, overlap resolution) is unknown and not consistent in pattern (sometimes increase, e.g., train 4 reds 17→30).
- Color-specific changes beyond pink/yellow→green (e.g., orange/light blue in some inputs absent in outputs; maroon→dark red relocation in train 1): Occurs but not in every example, so not listed as consistent.
- Irregular outlines or circular elements (mentioned in descriptions): No data on edges/holes/silhouettes in the provided lists (all holes=0, no shape type beyond bbox), so no identifiable interaction; cannot confirm consistency without visual data.
- Position→color effects beyond listed: Some bboxes shift without clear color link (e.g., train 3 orange [0,9,2,9]3 input → orange [0,0,4,2]15 output, pixels tripled, unknown trigger).

No other obvious, consistent interactions (e.g., involving light blue, orange, or black specifically) appear across every train example. Irrelevant elements like isolated 1-pixel non-adjacent shapes were ignored.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 15:59:08] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

[2025-10-03 15:59:08] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List

def reverse_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Reverse the order of rows in the grid."""
    return g[::-1]

def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid by swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]

def rotate90_clockwise(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise by reversing rows and transposing."""
    reversed_g = reverse_rows(g)
    rotated = transpose_grid(reversed_g)
    return rotated

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Apply 90-degree clockwise rotation to the input grid."""
    return rotate90_clockwise(g)
```

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:02:22] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored blocks, shapes, or pixel-like elements) must be processed according to specific rules to produce output grids with structured patterns, such as uniform blocks or aligned regions, rather than simple geometric operations like rotation. The goal appears to be recognizing and reorganizing "objects" or regions in the grid (e.g., blobs of numbers) into a canonical or solved form, possibly simulating a puzzle like sorting, mirroring, or extracting features from visual motifs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Numbers 0-9 likely represent distinct visual elements (e.g., colors, heights, or object types); outputs often consolidate them into large uniform blocks (e.g., rows/columns of the same number), suggesting rules for grouping or propagating values across regions.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have scattered or asymmetric placements (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s amid larger blocks), while outputs create symmetric or stacked blocks (e.g., multiple identical rows of 7s followed by 3s and 0s in Training 1), implying detection of boundaries, filling, or projection rules.
 * Outputs preserve some input structure but reorganize: e.g., in Training 1, expected has horizontal bands of 7s, 3s, 0s; in Training 2, vertical stacks with 6s, 3s, 8s, 9s; subtle mismatches occur in blob alignment or extension (e.g., 3s in Training 1 don't stretch fully in generated).
 * Easy-to-miss: Non-uniform regions (e.g., "islands" of numbers like 0s or 1s embedded in larger areas) need special handling—possibly extraction, counting, or replacement—rather than blind transformation; outputs often ignore or simplify small anomalies.
 * Consider edge cases like zero-width rows/columns or disconnected components; rules may involve symmetry (e.g., mirroring across axes) or dominance (e.g., majority number per row/column).
 * Across attempts, rotation/transposition fails because it scrambles positions without respecting semantic grouping (e.g., doesn't create the banded outputs); no evidence of criminal/irrelevant elements, but focus on visual pattern recognition.
 * Outputs are always printed as space-separated lists per row, matching input format.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def reverse_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Reverse the order of rows in the grid."""
    return g[::-1]
```

```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid by swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```

```python
def rotate90_clockwise(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise by reversing rows and transposing."""
    reversed_g = reverse_rows(g)
    rotated = transpose_grid(reversed_g)
    return rotated
```
(Note: These are from the attempt but only marginally helpful for geometric ops; extend to object detection, e.g., flood-fill for blobs, as rotation alone fails.)

 * The single attempt used 90-degree clockwise rotation via reverse and transpose, which worked for basic geometry but failed entirely on semantics—generated outputs preserve number counts but jumble positions into non-banded, asymmetric messes (e.g., Training 1 generated scattered 8s/7s/6s with misplaced 0/1/3/4/9, vs. expected clean horizontal bands of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Correctly implemented rotation mechanics (e.g., outputs are valid grids of same size with rotated elements), but this doesn't align with puzzle goals.
 * What didn't: Completely mismatched expected patterns—e.g., Training 1 generated vertical-ish stacks with intrusions (like isolated 0/1 in 8/7/6 areas) instead of uniform rows; Training 2 scrambled 8/1/3/5/7/9 into irregular shapes vs. expected vertical 6/3/8/9 bands; Training 3 mixed 5/9/4/8/6/1/7/3 haphazardly vs. horizontal 5/3 then vertical-ish 7/8/6/4; Training 4 disorganized 4/6/1/2/3 into non-stacked form vs. repeating 6/3/2 bands.
 * No object extraction attempted, leading to failure in recognizing regions (e.g., 3s in Training 1 should form a block, but rotation scatters them); subtle differences like partial overlaps (e.g., 1s as "noise" in inputs) are rotated but not resolved.
 * Rotation function is not helpful for the puzzle (don't use in future—it's geometric, not pattern-based); consider adding blob detection or row-majority voting instead.
 * All training examples failed for unknown reasons beyond rotation mismatch (possibly core rule is projection or sorting per axis).
 * No prior unhelpful functions beyond this; avoid pure transforms without semantic checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a rotated/messy version of some input (with sprawling 9/6/8/3/2/1/0/4/7 blocks and scattered anomalies like isolated 1s/0s), lacking the clean, banded structure of training expecteds (e.g., no uniform rows of single numbers stacking logically). 
 * It includes irregularities (e.g., diagonal-ish intrusions of 0/1/8 in 9/6 areas, fragmented 3s/2s) that suggest the rotation scrambled an underlying pattern without extracting or simplifying objects, unlike expecteds' symmetry.
 * Differences are stark: e.g., top rows mix 9/6 with trailing 3/9, vs. likely expected horizontal bands; bottom has clustered 4/7/1 amid 8/9, probably wrong as it doesn't consolidate into large uniform regions.
 * Does not make sense—looks like raw rotation artifacts (e.g., 30-column width implies non-square input rotated), missing puzzle's apparent rule of grouping/simplifying visual motifs; to fix, need rules for detecting dominant regions and propagating (e.g., fill small holes or align blobs vertically/horizontally).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-10-03 16:02:22] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

```python
from typing import List

def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    return [[grid[r][c] for r in range(rows)] for c in range(cols)]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    return transpose_grid(g)

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 16:06:41] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations on numbered matrices (likely representing pixel-like colors or labels), where the goal is to apply a specific operation—possibly rotation, reflection, or pattern realignment—to produce output grids with large, uniform blocks of numbers that form structured, symmetric, or layered patterns, as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The expected outputs consistently feature large contiguous blocks of identical numbers (e.g., rows or sections fully filled with 7s, 3s, 0s, 6s, or 8s), suggesting the transformation preserves or creates rectangular regions rather than scattering values.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes or "blobs" of numbers that may not span the full grid width/height; for instance, in Training 1, the expected has vertical stacks of 7s transitioning to 3s and 0s without fragmentation, while generated outputs fragment them horizontally/vertically due to transposition.
 * Rotations (e.g., 90/180/270 degrees) or mirroring might be involved, as expected patterns resemble rotated versions of potential input blobs; easy to miss that simple transposes swap rows/columns but don't account for reordering or direction (clockwise vs. counterclockwise).
 * Connected components or "objects" (groups of same-number cells) need extraction and manipulation; subtle rule: only certain numbers (e.g., non-zero or specific labels) form valid objects, and isolated cells (like single 1s) may be noise or separators.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1: 12x16, Training 2: 10x10, etc.), so functions must handle rectangular grids dynamically without assuming squares.
 * Padding or boundary handling: Expected outputs often have aligned edges (e.g., full-width blocks), implying zero-padding or cropping might be needed for alignment.
 * All training examples emphasize vertical/horizontal striping or layering (e.g., top-heavy with one number, bottom with another), so transformations should prioritize axis-aligned realignment over diagonal or scattered effects.
 * Easy to miss: Numbers like 1, 0, or 9 may act as "fillers," "holes," or boundaries; in Training 3, expected has clean transitions between 5s, 3s, 6s, and 4s, without the scattered 1s/8s in generated.
 * Considerations across attempts: No input grids are shown, only outputs, so reverse-engineering from expected vs. generated is key; potential for multiple steps (e.g., detect regions, then rotate each).
 * Irrelevant subtleties to avoid: Pure flattening or listing doesn't help, as outputs must remain 2D grids.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def rotate_90_clockwise(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Rotates grid 90 degrees clockwise; useful for realigning vertical blocks to horizontal or vice versa."""
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    return [[grid[rows - 1 - r][c] for r in range(rows)] for c in range(cols)]
```

```python
def extract_regions(grid: List[List[int]], target_num: int) -> List[List[List[int]]]:
    """Extracts connected components (blobs) of a specific number; helpful for isolating objects before transformation.
    Uses simple flood-fill to find regions; returns list of subgrids for each blob."""
    # Placeholder: Implement DFS/BFS to find 4-connected regions of target_num.
    # Ignore for now as basic version; extend to 8-connected if diagonals matter.
    pass  # Not fully implemented, but essential for handling non-uniform grids.
```

```python
def transpose_and_reverse(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transposes then reverses each row; alternative to pure transpose for 90-degree rotation effects."""
    transposed = [[grid[r][c] for r in range(len(grid))] for c in range(len(grid[0]))]
    return [row[::-1] for row in transposed]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The only attempt used a basic transpose_grid function, which swapped rows and columns but failed to realign blocks correctly, producing scattered, non-uniform rows (e.g., in Training 1, generated has mixed 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s per row, while expected has pure blocks like full rows of 7s or 0s).
 * What worked: Transpose correctly handles empty grids and preserves all values without loss; it's a building block for rotations (e.g., transpose + reverse = 90-degree rotate).
 * What didn't work: It scrambles spatial relationships, turning vertical blocks into horizontal fragments (e.g., Training 1 generated row [6,6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected full [7,7,7,...,7,7,7]; similar fragmentation in all trainings).
 * Training 1: Generated mismatches block transitions (e.g., expected has 4 rows of 7s + 3s, then 0s; generated has irregular 6s bleeding into 7s/8s; unknown why 1s/3s/9s appear as artifacts, possibly from input noise not handled).
 * Training 2: Generated has scattered 1s/3s/5s/9s (e.g., row [7,7,7,8,8,1,1,1,8,8] vs. expected clean [6,6,6,...,7,7]), failing to consolidate into expected 6/3/8/9 layers.
 * Training 3: Generated fragments 5s/3s/6s/4s with extra 1s/8s/9s (e.g., row [6,6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform [5,5,5,...,3,3,3,...]), missing vertical stacking.
 * Training 4: Generated scatters 2s/6s/3s/1s (e.g., row [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected layered [6,6,6,...,2,2,2]), disrupting block purity.
 * Function `transpose_grid` is partially helpful as a primitive but broken for this puzzle (produces incorrect orientations; don't use standalone—combine with reverses or rotates).
 * No extraction of objects was attempted, which is essential for handling blob-like patterns in inputs; pure grid ops ignore regional semantics.
 * Missed: All attempts ignore potential rotation direction or mirroring, leading to mismatched alignments (e.g., expected often has "top-to-bottom" gradients not captured by left-to-right transpose).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears as a heavily fragmented, irregular grid with scattered 9s, 6s, 3s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 8s, and 7s/4s in later rows (e.g., row [9,9,9,...,6,6,6,...,9,9,9] mixes values without forming blocks, and lower rows like [9,9,3,1,3,3,3,0,0,1,1,2,...] have chaotic insertions of singles like 1/8).
 * It fails to produce the uniform, blocky structure implied by training expecteds (e.g., no large pure-9 or pure-6 sections; instead, noise like isolated 1s/0s/2s suggests unhandled "holes" or boundaries).
 * Differences: Expected likely has layered blocks (e.g., top-heavy 9s transitioning to 6s/3s like in Training 1/2), but generated is a transposed jumble without consolidation; unknown why specific artifacts (e.g., 1s in positions 7-8 of row 6) appear, possibly from input irregularities not filtered.
 * To handle test: Need region detection to group same-numbers, then rotate/realign each; account for larger size (~30 cols) and potential multi-blob inputs with separators (e.g., 0s as voids).

[2025-10-03 16:06:41] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected regions) that must be transformed according to specific pattern-based rules, producing output grids with large uniform blocks or stripes of numbers, often filling or outlining detected structures like blobs or lines. The goal is to recognize and manipulate connected components or regions in the input to match structured, repetitive expected outputs, rather than simple operations like transposition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain scattered numbers (0-9) forming irregular patterns or "blobs" of connected same-valued cells (likely 4-connected or 8-connected), and the output reinterprets these into horizontal bands or blocks of uniform values, suggesting rules for grouping, filling, or mirroring regions.
 * Outputs often feature repeating rows of the same pattern (e.g., entire rows of 7s with a small block of 3s in specific columns), indicating vertical symmetry or replication across rows, but with transitions between block types (e.g., from 7s to 3s to 0s) based on input structure.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have jagged edges or isolated cells (e.g., single 1s or small clusters), but outputs simplify them into clean rectangular blocks, possibly by expanding, contracting, or selecting dominant values per "layer" or section.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so rules must be size-agnostic; outputs preserve dimensions but reorganize content.
 * Connected components seem key: inputs show clusters (e.g., 3s forming shapes), outputs map them to filled regions (e.g., all 3s become a horizontal stripe across multiple rows).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored blocks, shapes, or pixel-like elements) must be processed according to specific rules to produce output grids with structured patterns, such as uniform blocks or aligned regions, rather than simple geometric operations like rotation. The goal appears to be recognizing and reorganizing "objects" or regions in the grid (e.g., blobs of numbers) into a canonical or solved form, possibly simulating a puzzle like sorting, mirroring, or extracting features from visual motifs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Numbers 0-9 likely represent distinct visual elements (e.g., colors, heights, or object types); outputs often consolidate them into large uniform blocks (e.g., rows/columns of the same number), suggesting rules for grouping or propagating values across regions.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have scattered or asymmetric placements (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s amid larger blocks), while outputs create symmetric or stacked blocks (e.g., multiple identical rows of 7s followed by 3s and 0s in Training 1), implying detection of boundaries, filling, or projection rules.
 * Outputs preserve some input structure but reorganize: e.g., in Training 1, expected has horizontal bands of 7s, 3s, 0s; in Training 2, vertical stacks with 6s, 3s, 8s, 9s; subtle mismatches occur in blob alignment or extension (e.g., 3s in Training 1 don't stretch fully in generated).
 * Easy-to-miss: Non-uniform regions (e.g., "islands" of numbers like 0s or 1s embedded in larger areas) need special handling—possibly extraction, counting, or replacement—rather than blind transformation; outputs often ignore or simplify small anomalies.
 * Consider edge cases like zero-width rows/columns or disconnected components; rules may involve symmetry (e.g., mirroring across axes) or dominance (e.g., majority number per row/column).
 * Across attempts, rotation/transposition fails because it scrambles positions without respecting semantic grouping (e.g., doesn't create the banded outputs); no evidence of criminal/irrelevant elements, but focus on visual pattern recognition.
 * Outputs are always printed as space-separated lists per row, matching input format.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def reverse_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Reverse the order of rows in the grid."""
    return g[::-1]
```

```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid by swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```

```python
def rotate90_clockwise(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise by reversing rows and transposing."""
    reversed_g = reverse_rows(g)
    rotated = transpose_grid(reversed_g)
    return rotated
```
(Note: These are from the attempt but only marginally helpful for geometric ops; extend to object detection, e.g., flood-fill for blobs, as rotation alone fails.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used 90-degree clockwise rotation via reverse and transpose, which worked for basic geometry but failed entirely on semantics—generated outputs preserve number counts but jumble positions into non-banded, asymmetric messes (e.g., Training 1 generated scattered 8s/7s/6s with misplaced 0/1/3/4/9, vs. expected clean horizontal bands of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Correctly implemented rotation mechanics (e.g., outputs are valid grids of same size with rotated elements), but this doesn't align with puzzle goals.
 * What didn't: Completely mismatched expected patterns—e.g., Training 1 generated vertical-ish stacks with intrusions (like isolated 0/1 in 8/7/6 areas) instead of uniform rows; Training 2 scrambled 8/1/3/5/7/9 into irregular shapes vs. expected vertical 6/3/8/9 bands; Training 3 mixed 5/9/4/8/6/1/7/3 haphazardly vs. horizontal 5/3 then vertical-ish 7/8/6/4; Training 4 disorganized 4/6/1/2/3 into non-stacked form vs. repeating 6/3/2 bands.
 * No object extraction attempted, leading to failure in recognizing regions (e.g., 3s in Training 1 should form a block, but rotation scatters them); subtle differences like partial overlaps (e.g., 1s as "noise" in inputs) are rotated but not resolved.
 * Rotation function is not helpful for the puzzle (don't use in future—it's geometric, not pattern-based); consider adding blob detection or row-majority voting instead.
 * All training examples failed for unknown reasons beyond rotation mismatch (possibly core rule is projection or sorting per axis).
 * No prior unhelpful functions beyond this; avoid pure transforms without semantic checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a rotated/messy version of some input (with sprawling 9/6/8/3/2/1/0/4/7 blocks and scattered anomalies like isolated 1s/0s), lacking the clean, banded structure of training expecteds (e.g., no uniform rows of single numbers stacking logically). 
 * It includes irregularities (e.g., diagonal-ish intrusions of 0/1/8 in 9/6 areas, fragmented 3s/2s) that suggest the rotation scrambled an underlying pattern without extracting or simplifying objects, unlike expecteds' symmetry.
 * Differences are stark: e.g., top rows mix 9/6 with trailing 3/9, vs. likely expected horizontal bands; bottom has clustered 4/7/1 amid 8/9, probably wrong as it doesn't consolidate into large uniform regions.
 * Does not make sense—looks like raw rotation artifacts (e.g., 30-column width implies non-square input rotated), missing puzzle's apparent rule of grouping/simplifying visual motifs; to fix, need rules for detecting dominant regions and propagating (e.g., fill small holes or align blobs vertically/horizontally).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations on numbered matrices (likely representing pixel-like colors or labels), where the goal is to apply a specific operation—possibly rotation, reflection, or pattern realignment—to produce output grids with large, uniform blocks of numbers that form structured, symmetric, or layered patterns, as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The expected outputs consistently feature large contiguous blocks of identical numbers (e.g., rows or sections fully filled with 7s, 3s, 0s, 6s, or 8s), suggesting the transformation preserves or creates rectangular regions rather than scattering values.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes or "blobs" of numbers that may not span the full grid width/height; for instance, in Training 1, the expected has vertical stacks of 7s transitioning to 3s and 0s without fragmentation, while generated outputs fragment them horizontally/vertically due to transposition.
 * Rotations (e.g., 90/180/270 degrees) or mirroring might be involved, as expected patterns resemble rotated versions of potential input blobs; easy to miss that simple transposes swap rows/columns but don't account for reordering or direction (clockwise vs. counterclockwise).
 * Connected components or "objects" (groups of same-number cells) need extraction and manipulation; subtle rule: only certain numbers (e.g., non-zero or specific labels) form valid objects, and isolated cells (like single 1s) may be noise or separators.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1: 12x16, Training 2: 10x10, etc.), so functions must handle rectangular grids dynamically without assuming squares.
 * Padding or boundary handling: Expected outputs often have aligned edges (e.g., full-width blocks), implying zero-padding or cropping might be needed for alignment.
 * All training examples emphasize vertical/horizontal striping or layering (e.g., top-heavy with one number, bottom with another), so transformations should prioritize axis-aligned realignment over diagonal or scattered effects.
 * Easy to miss: Numbers like 1, 0, or 9 may act as "fillers," "holes," or boundaries; in Training 3, expected has clean transitions between 5s, 3s, 6s, and 4s, without the scattered 1s/8s in generated.
 * Considerations across attempts: No input grids are shown, only outputs, so reverse-engineering from expected vs. generated is key; potential for multiple steps (e.g., detect regions, then rotate each).
 * Irrelevant subtleties to avoid: Pure flattening or listing doesn't help, as outputs must remain 2D grids.

    return [row[::-1] for row in transposed]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The only attempt used a basic transpose_grid function, which swapped rows and columns but failed to realign blocks correctly, producing scattered, non-uniform rows (e.g., in Training 1, generated has mixed 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s per row, while expected has pure blocks like full rows of 7s or 0s).
 * What worked: Transpose correctly handles empty grids and preserves all values without loss; it's a building block for rotations (e.g., transpose + reverse = 90-degree rotate).
 * What didn't work: It scrambles spatial relationships, turning vertical blocks into horizontal fragments (e.g., Training 1 generated row [6,6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected full [7,7,7,...,7,7,7]; similar fragmentation in all trainings).
 * Training 1: Generated mismatches block transitions (e.g., expected has 4 rows of 7s + 3s, then 0s; generated has irregular 6s bleeding into 7s/8s; unknown why 1s/3s/9s appear as artifacts, possibly from input noise not handled).
 * Training 2: Generated has scattered 1s/3s/5s/9s (e.g., row [7,7,7,8,8,1,1,1,8,8] vs. expected clean [6,6,6,...,7,7]), failing to consolidate into expected 6/3/8/9 layers.
 * Training 3: Generated fragments 5s/3s/6s/4s with extra 1s/8s/9s (e.g., row [6,6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform [5,5,5,...,3,3,3,...]), missing vertical stacking.
 * Training 4: Generated scatters 2s/6s/3s/1s (e.g., row [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected layered [6,6,6,...,2,2,2]), disrupting block purity.
 * Function `transpose_grid` is partially helpful as a primitive but broken for this puzzle (produces incorrect orientations; don't use standalone—combine with reverses or rotates).
 * No extraction of objects was attempted, which is essential for handling blob-like patterns in inputs; pure grid ops ignore regional semantics.
 * Missed: All attempts ignore potential rotation direction or mirroring, leading to mismatched alignments (e.g., expected often has "top-to-bottom" gradients not captured by left-to-right transpose).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears as a heavily fragmented, irregular grid with scattered 9s, 6s, 3s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 8s, and 7s/4s in later rows (e.g., row [9,9,9,...,6,6,6,...,9,9,9] mixes values without forming blocks, and lower rows like [9,9,3,1,3,3,3,0,0,1,1,2,...] have chaotic insertions of singles like 1/8).
 * It fails to produce the uniform, blocky structure implied by training expecteds (e.g., no large pure-9 or pure-6 sections; instead, noise like isolated 1s/0s/2s suggests unhandled "holes" or boundaries).
 * Differences: Expected likely has layered blocks (e.g., top-heavy 9s transitioning to 6s/3s like in Training 1/2), but generated is a transposed jumble without consolidation; unknown why specific artifacts (e.g., 1s in positions 7-8 of row 6) appear, possibly from input irregularities not filtered.
 * To handle test: Need region detection to group same-numbers, then rotate/realign each; account for larger size (~30 cols) and potential multi-blob inputs with separators (e.g., 0s as voids).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where scattered or patterned numbers in an input grid are resolved into structured blocks or bands of uniform values, likely based on dominance, frequency, or regional grouping rules rather than global uniform filling. The goal appears to be creating clean, horizontal or block-like patterns that preserve some aspects of the original structure, such as partial extensions or transitions between values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The transformation seems to involve identifying horizontal bands or rows/sections where a dominant value (possibly mode or majority) fills most of the space, but with subtle extensions or overrides in specific columns (e.g., in training example 1, 7s extend into the right side of 3 and 0 blocks, and 3s appear in a middle band with partial 7s).
 * Not all rows become fully uniform; instead, patterns show vertical consistency in columns while allowing horizontal segmentation (e.g., training example 2 has repeating rows with mixed blocks like 6s transitioning to 7s or 9s in specific positions, not full-row fills).
 * Ties in frequency or modes may favor certain values (e.g., maximum value in ties, as attempted), but the rule isn't purely row/column mode— it might require regional analysis, like connected components or blobs of similar values.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs often repeat the same row pattern multiple times vertically (e.g., 4 identical rows of a pattern in example 1), suggesting vertical stacking or propagation of horizontal decisions; transitions between blocks aren't abrupt but can have overlaps (e.g., example 3 has mixed values in middle rows before uniform 6s and 4s).
 * Potential for "scattered patterns" to simplify into "clean horizontal bands," but not via simple transpose-and-fill, as that loses positional details like the 3s interrupting 7s in example 1.
 * No evidence of rotation, mirroring, or non-numeric operations; focus on integer values (0-9) and their grouping.
 * Easy to miss: The output preserves some original positional relationships (e.g., right-side columns in example 1 keep 7s across changing bands), and not everything is filled uniformly—minority values can dominate in sub-regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for analyzing columns if the rule involves vertical dominance, but over-reliance leads to errors as seen.)

```python
def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This handles frequency-based decisions with tie-breaking, which aligns with potential dominance rules, but needs adaptation for regions, not full rows/columns.)

```python
def fill_row_with_mode(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fills a row with its computed mode value.
    Handles the transformation rule of uniform filling based on row dominance.
    """
    mode = compute_mode(row)
    return [mode for _ in row]
```
(This simplifies patterns to uniforms, which partially captures "clean bands" but fails on partial fills and positional preservation; not sufficient alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used transpose then mode-fill on transposed rows, creating fully uniform horizontal bands in the output (e.g., entire rows of 6s, 7s, 4s in training 1), which worked for simplifying scattered values into blocks but failed to preserve mixed patterns like the 3s interrupting 7s or the right-side 7 extensions in training example 1.
 * In training example 1, generated all-6s (top), all-7s (middle), all-4s (bottom) blocks, but expected has vertical repetition of mixed rows (e.g., 7s with partial 3s and 7s on right, then 3s with 7s on right, then 0s with 3s and 7s), so it over-uniformized and ignored column-specific propagations.
 * Training example 2 generated stacked uniform rows (8s, 3s, 7s, etc.), but expected has repeating mixed blocks (e.g., 6s transitioning to 7s on right, with 8s and 9s in middle sections), missing horizontal segmentation and vertical consistency in sub-columns.
 * Training example 3 generated uniform 6s and 4s blocks with a single 1s row, but expected has top uniform 5s/3s bands transitioning to mixed middle rows (7/8/6/3/6/4 patterns) before uniform bottoms, so it collapsed diverse middle rows incorrectly.
 * Training example 4 generated scattered uniform rows (6s, 4s, 1s, 3s), but expected has repeating 6/2 and 3/2 blocks vertically, indicating failure to group and propagate patterns across multiple rows.
 * Transpose was helpful for column analysis but combined with full-row fill made outputs too simplistic, losing regional details; compute_mode is relevant for dominance but needs per-segment application, not whole rows.
 * No object extraction functions were used or proposed, but the puzzle might benefit from identifying "blobs" or connected regions of values (unexplored so far); fill_row_with_mode is partially helpful for uniform bands but broken for mixed rows—don't use it without segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it consists of fully uniform long rows (30 elements each) of single values (9s, 6s, 0s, 2s, 4s) stacked vertically into large blocks, which mirrors the over-simplification seen in training examples and ignores likely mixed or segmented patterns.
 * It generates a top row of all 9s (unusual, as inputs probably don't have such dominance), then blocks of 6s (3 rows), 0s (4 rows), 9s (4 rows), 0s (1 row), 9s (1 row), 2s (8 rows), 9s (4 rows), 4s (4 rows), suggesting the transpose-mode-fill blindly propagated column modes without considering horizontal variations or regional rules.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected outputs from training show repeated but mixed rows (e.g., partial fills in columns), not monolithic blocks; it likely mismatches by not handling transitions or sub-regions, making the output too uniform and grid-filling without subtlety.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of input grids composed of colored blocks (integers 0-9 representing colors or background) into output grids through rules like filling holes, expanding or repositioning small shapes, resolving overlaps, and possibly rotating or resizing the grid to match output patterns. The goal is to identify and apply consistent rules across examples to produce structured block arrangements in the outputs, often simplifying or reorganizing components while preserving dominant colors and shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small blue shapes (1's, 1-4 pixels) appear embedded or adjacent to larger blocks and are filled by the nearest non-1 color using flood-fill (BFS), but this must be precise to avoid over-filling or altering large blocks unexpectedly.
 * Positional overlaps in larger blocks are resolved by dominance, such as taking the max color in a local neighborhood, but this can lead to uniform spreading if not bounded correctly; subtle overlaps may require component-based merging rather than local max.
 * Small non-blue shapes (e.g., 3's, 9's with <5 pixels) are expanded into adjacent larger blocks or repositioned, but expansions should be limited and directionally aware (e.g., toward dominant areas) to avoid infinite growth or incorrect absorption.
 * Maroon blocks (8's) tend to migrate to bottom or side positions in outputs, suggesting a repositioning rule like shifting to lower rows/columns, but this must account for grid size changes and avoid overwriting other elements.
 * Light blue (9's, small and nested) may emerge or expand inward from enclosures, checking for uniform surrounding colors, but only if fully nested (all 4 directions same non-9); partial nesting or edge cases can break this.
 * Outputs often have consistent dimensions or transpositions (e.g., rotating the grid), with blocks stretching vertically/horizontally; background (0's) fills unused areas, and small components may disappear or merge entirely.
 * Color counts and connectivity matter: large components (>5 pixels) dominate, small ones are absorbed or moved; 4-connectivity for floods, but 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonals in some shapes.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., inputs 10x10 to 30x?, outputs rectangular blocks), so rules must handle padding with 0's and potential transposition/resize at the end.
 * Subtle: Some colors like 3's or 9's invert positions (top to bottom), 8's cluster at edges; avoid assuming all small shapes behave the same—9's may stay nested while 3's expand/merge.
 * All examples show simplification: complex nested inputs become layered horizontal/vertical bands of colors, with no isolated small pixels in outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program applies a sequence of filling, adjustment, expansion, repositioning, enclosure handling, and transpose, but all training examples failed, indicating over-application or incorrect order of rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated large top blocks of 6/7 with misplaced 9's/4's/8's at bottom, but expected vertical bands of 7/3 with 0's filling lower areas; missed repositioning 3's to mid-bottom and eliminating small 4/9 intrusions, over-expanded 8's incorrectly.
 * Training example 2: Generated scattered 7/8/6/3 with misplaced 5's, but expected structured 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 layers; failed to merge small 3's into bands, incorrectly positioned 8's and introduced non-existent 5's (likely from bad adjustment).
 * Training example 3: Generated horizontal 6/9/3/4/8 bands with 0's, but expected mixed 5/3/7/8/6/4 layers; incorrectly introduced 5's (not in input?) and failed to create the specific vertical stacking with 3's dominating mid-section.
 * Training example 4: Generated vertical 2/6/3/4 bands, but expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers with 2's at right; missed horizontal reorganization and stretching of 6's across rows.
 * handle_position_color_adjustment (max in 3x3) caused unwanted spreading (e.g., uniform 7's in ex1), not helpful—replace with component merging.
 * expand_small_non_blue over-expands without proper limits or directionality, leading to blob distortion (e.g., small 3's overtaking areas in ex2); broken for large grids.
 * reposition_maroon_blocks moves 8's arbitrarily without preserving counts or avoiding overlaps, causing bottom clutter (ex1); not helpful as is—needs target position calculation based on output patterns.
 * handle_light_blue_enclosure checks nesting but expands outward incorrectly, creating artifacts (e.g., 9's leaking in ex1); subtle nesting detection misses edges, making it unreliable.
 * Overall, sequence starts with filling (somewhat correct for 1's) but cascades errors; no object extraction, so rules apply pixel-wise instead of shape-wise, missing connected components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid (inferred from rows) with messy, irregular bands of 9's dominating left/top, interspersed with 6's, 3's, 2's, 8's, and scattered 0's/7's/4's, lacking the clean horizontal/vertical block structure seen in expected training outputs.
 * It does not look correct: Expected outputs have uniform, stretched color bands (e.g., full-row 7's or 6's with sharp transitions), but this has jagged edges, isolated pixels (e.g., single 7's), and over-proliferated 9's/8's without clear layering; likely from faulty filling/expansion propagating errors across the large input.
 * Missing simplification: Input has complex nesting (3's in 9's, 2's in 0's, 8's at bottom-right), but output should resolve to banded layers (e.g., 9's as background enclosure, 6's as mid-band, 2's/3's repositioned); instead, it retains too much input chaos.
 * Does not match test considerations: Large size suggests need for scalable rules (e.g., component sizes), but output has uneven 0-fills and misplaced small colors (4's/7's appearing erroneously), indicating broken color propagation.

 * The inputs are noisy versions of structured grids with rectangular or block-like regions of the same number (e.g., large uniform areas separated by boundaries), and the goal is to propagate dominant values across regions while suppressing outliers or noise without over-smoothing across distinct boundaries.
 * Expected outputs preserve sharp edges between different regions (e.g., horizontal/vertical lines of transition) and expand or fill uniform blocks consistently across rows/columns, often resulting in symmetric or repeating patterns like stacked rectangles.
 * Subtle elements include handling edges/corners differently (e.g., fewer neighbors), resolving ties in mode by favoring maximum values, and avoiding bleed-over between adjacent but distinct regions (e.g., a single outlier shouldn't propagate to dominate a whole block).
 * Transposition is used to reorient vertical structures horizontally for processing, but over-application of smoothing can blur boundaries or incorrectly fill regions (e.g., turning isolated noise into false extensions).
 * Patterns often involve decreasing or increasing value gradients vertically/horizontally, with some regions "growing" downward or rightward in the expectations.
 * Noise includes scattered single values or small clusters that should be overwritten by surrounding majorities, but smoothing must be directional or iterative to match exact block shapes.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 10x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; empty or zero values may represent backgrounds that should expand but not override foregrounds.
 * Iterative smoothing (multiple passes) might be needed for propagation, but single passes as in the attempt cause incomplete fills.
 * No rotation or scaling is evident; focus on local neighborhood consensus (e.g., 3x3 or linear neighbors) to build larger structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    if not lst:
        return 0
    count = Counter(lst)
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This function is useful for local consensus but needs better tie-breaking or weighting for boundaries.)

```python
def smooth_row(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Smooths a row by replacing each value with the mode of itself and its immediate neighbors.
    Handles edges by using available neighbors.
    This rule handles local noise reduction in rows, preserving block-like structures.
    """

        return []
    n = len(row)
    smoothed = row[:]
    for i in range(n):
        neighbors = [row[i]]
        if i > 0:
            neighbors.append(row[i - 1])
        if i < n - 1:
            neighbors.append(row[i + 1])
        smoothed[i] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return smoothed
```
(This is helpful for 1D denoising but insufficient alone; extend to 2D neighborhoods for better block preservation.)

```python
def smooth_grid_vertical(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Smooths each column vertically by treating columns as rows and applying smooth_row.
    This rule handles vertical noise reduction, complementing horizontal smoothing.

    n_rows = len(g)
    n_cols = len(g[0])
    smoothed = [row[:] for row in g]
    for j in range(n_cols):
        col = [g[i][j] for i in range(n_rows)]
        smoothed_col = smooth_row(col)
        for i in range(n_rows):
            smoothed[i][j] = smoothed_col[i]
    return smoothed
```
(This complements row smoothing but causes over-smoothing in vertical directions, blurring expected sharp horizontal bands.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Transposes the grid, swapping rows and columns.
    This core transformation reorients the input to align vertical structures horizontally.
    """
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is potentially useful for handling asymmetric noise but in the attempt, applying it once before smoothing misaligns structures, leading to incorrect propagation.)

(No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; future attempts might need flood-fill or region-growing to identify and clean blocks explicitly, as simple neighbor mode doesn't capture connected components well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used transposition followed by horizontal row smoothing and then vertical column smoothing, aiming for noise reduction via local modes, but this over-smoothed and incorrectly propagated values across boundaries, failing to produce the blocky, uniform regions in expectations.
 * In Training 1, generated output created uniform top bands of 6/7/8 and bottom bands of 4/7/8 with scattered 9s, but expected clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0 with sharp vertical offsets (e.g., columns 11-13 as 3s, rest 7s in top; full 3s in middle; 0/3 in bottom)—the smoothing filled too much horizontally after transpose, ignoring vertical block integrity.
 * In Training 2, generated irregular bands of 7/8/3/5/9 with jagged edges (e.g., row 4 has 7s then 3s; row 9 has mixed 3/6), but expected structured blocks like top 6s, middle 3/8/6 bands, and bottom 3/8/9/7—transpose + smoothing created false vertical fills (e.g., 9s appearing where 6s should dominate).
 * In Training 3, generated mixed 6/4/3/8/5/9 with incomplete blocks (e.g., row 1 all 6/9; row 4 has 6/4/8), but expected top 5/3 bands, middle 7/8/6/3/6/4—smoothing failed to expand 3s leftward or align vertical columns properly, leaving noise like isolated 5s.
 * In Training 4, generated descending 2/6/3 bands with irregularities (e.g., row 5 has 2/1/6; row 7 has 3/6/3), but expected uniform top/middle/bottom 6/3/2 blocks with repeating rows—vertical smoothing overwrote horizontal patterns, creating false 1s and uneven fills.
 * No training sample passed, indicating the linear neighbor mode (only left/right or up/down) doesn't capture 2D locality well; needs fuller neighborhoods or region-based filling.
 * The compute_mode tie-breaker (max value) sometimes favors high numbers incorrectly (e.g., 9s over 6s in test), but it's not the core issue—lack of iteration or boundary detection is.
 * Transpose is helpful for reorientation but applying it rigidly without inverse or multiple steps misaligns outputs (e.g., expected patterns aren't transposed back).
 * Simple smoothing functions like smooth_row and smooth_grid_vertical are partially helpful for local noise but broken for global structure—they propagate too aggressively without respecting block connectivity, leading to smeared results; not sufficient alone, but could be built upon with iterations or masks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which might be essential for identifying dominant regions (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of same value and expand them); current approach treats all pixels equally, missing this.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it remains highly noisy with scattered values (e.g., isolated 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 8s, 9s in irregular clusters) and incomplete fills (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s/7s/8s; rows 14-24 show patchy 0/2/6/9/8 bands with jagged edges like single 7s or 4s), failing to form the clean, rectangular blocks seen in training expectations.
 * Unlike expectations' uniform horizontal bands (e.g., full rows of same value or clear column-wise shifts), the output has over-propagated 9s in corners/top and fragmented middle regions (e.g., 0s not fully expanding to background blocks; 2s forming small irregular shapes instead of solid areas), suggesting the transpose + dual smoothing smeared noise without resolving underlying structures.
 * It doesn't make sense as a cleaned puzzle—looks more like partially denoised input than a solved pattern (e.g., no coherent shapes like letters/symbols emerge; values like 4s and 7s appear as outliers where 9/6/8/0/3/2 should dominate blocks).
 * To handle test case, need to prevent boundary bleed (e.g., 9s invading 6/0 areas) and promote vertical consistency (e.g., expand 3s downward fully); current method's single-pass linear smoothing can't achieve this, as seen in persistent scatter.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a puzzle involving transforming input grids of integers (likely representing pixel colors or labels in a visual pattern) into output grids that simplify or correct the structure, emphasizing blocky, uniform regions while preserving distinct shapes and boundaries of "objects" or blobs, possibly through region filling, noise removal, or segmentation rules that propagate values selectively rather than uniformly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently show large uniform blocks of the same number (e.g., long stretches of 7s, 3s, or 9s), suggesting the goal is to expand or fill connected regions into rectangular or structured shapes, but without over-smoothing across unrelated areas.
 * Boundaries between regions must be sharp and respected; for example, in training example 1 expected output, there's a clear vertical stack of 7s on the right, with a thin 3-column band of 3s separating upper and lower sections, and a bottom band of 0s—generated output instead bleeds 6s and 4s incorrectly into these areas.
 * Grids may be non-square, and transposition is used in the program for dimension matching, but this seems to distort orientations; expected outputs maintain the input's row/column structure without flipping.
 * Iterative application is key for propagation, but the number of iterations (size//6 +1) is too aggressive or insufficient, leading to incomplete filling (e.g., in training example 2, generated has scattered 1s and 5s persisting, while expected has clean bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, and 9s).
 * Mode computation favors the maximum in ties, which may bias toward higher numbers (e.g., 9s dominating in test output), but expected outputs sometimes prioritize lower or specific values (e.g., 0s in example 1 bottom, 3s over others).
 * Edge handling in neighborhoods is basic (using available cells), but subtle: corners/edges should not leak values from distant regions; generated outputs show unwanted propagation (e.g., in example 3, 4s and 8s mix incorrectly, while expected has distinct horizontal bands and vertical alignments like 3s and 6s).
 * No global rules like thresholding or connectivity (e.g., 4-connected vs 8-connected) are applied; outputs suggest flood-fill-like behavior for blobs, but only within implied shapes—e.g., example 4 expected has repeating 6/3/2 bands vertically, but generated scatters 1s and uneven 6s.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve some asymmetry or "stair-step" boundaries (e.g., example 2 expected has 9s only in bottom-right), but smoothing erases them; also, empty or zero areas (like 0s in example 1) must remain as backgrounds, not filled.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), no object extraction is done—grids seem to contain multiple "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need individual processing, like identifying connected components before filling.
 * Considerations: Inputs may have noise (scattered single cells), which should be removed by majority in local regions, but not globally; test input has complex shapes (e.g., a large 9 background with embedded 3s, 0s, 2s, 6s, 4s, 7s, 8s), suggesting hierarchical filling where backgrounds expand but inner shapes hold.

            new_g[i][j] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return new_g
```
(This is a core smoothing tool that works for local denoising but fails on global structure; useful as a building block, but needs integration with region detection.)

No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; a function like `extract_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]` (returning blobs) would be essential for isolating and filling shapes separately, as pure smoothing mixes everything.

The main `program` function combines transpose and iterative smoothing, which is a reasonable start for propagation but broken for boundary preservation—don't rely on it as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt uses iterative 2D mode-based smoothing after optional transpose, which partially works for expanding uniform regions (e.g., large 9 blocks in test output mimic background filling) but fails to preserve distinct blob shapes and introduces unwanted bleeding (e.g., 6s overwriting 0/3 areas).
 * Transposition for non-square grids mismatches orientations; in example 1 (12x16 input implied), it likely flips rows/columns, causing horizontal bands to become vertical incorrectly.
 * Smoothing iterations (size//6 +1) are too few or mismatched; example 2 generated leaves noise like 1s and 5s, while expected cleans to solid bands—propagation doesn't reach far enough or respects connectivity wrong.
 * Mode tie-breaking to max value biases high numbers (e.g., 8/9 dominating in example 3 generated vs. expected 3/6/4 bands).
 * No handling for background (0s) or specific value priorities; example 1 generated fills bottom with 4s instead of 0s, and upper with 6s instead of 7s.
 * Example 4 generated has uneven 6s and persistent 1s in a place expected to be clean 3s/2s, showing poor noise removal in sparse areas.
 * Overall, approach understands local majority but misses global rules like connected-component filling or shape recognition—e.g., all trainings have blocky, aligned rectangles in expected, but generated has jagged remnants.
 * Function `smooth_grid_2d` is helpful but incomplete (lacks connectivity); `transpose` may be irrelevant or harmful (don't use unless dimensions demand it); no unhelpful functions beyond that, but pure iteration without seeding or masking is not sufficient.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-smooths into massive 9/6/8/4/2/7 blocks with some jagged edges (e.g., scattered 0s and 2s in the middle persist partially, but large areas like the top-left 9s and bottom-right 4s expand too far), losing distinct embedded shapes like the 3-blob, 0-void, and 2-strip in the input.
 * It resembles aggressive denoising but ignores subtle boundaries—e.g., the input's vertical 3-column of 3s and horizontal 0/2 bands get partially erased into surrounding 9s/6s, while expected (inferred from trainings) should maintain clean, rectangular fills for each region without crossover (e.g., 0s as background voids, 2s as a thin inner strip).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats the error of bleeding values (like 9s overwriting 3s/7s), and the structure doesn't align to blocky patterns—e.g., the right-side 7/4 areas mix into 9s incorrectly; this suggests the program would fail if the test expected preserved object separations.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Dict], List[Dict]]:
    # (Full implementation as in the program: BFS to find non-blue components and separately blue components)
    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:08:57] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color transformation, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, position, and specific color interactions, then fill and transpose the resulting grid to match an expected output pattern. The rules seem to simulate "object" simplification or unification in a 2D spatial puzzle, possibly inspired by image segmentation or blob analysis, but with custom color-specific behaviors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and must be of the exact same color; bounding boxes (bbox) are used to approximate regions for adjacency checks, but this can lead to over-merging if not precise (e.g., diagonal or distant touches aren't handled).
 * Small components (size <=4) of blue (1) are absorbed into adjacent non-blues, prioritizing the largest; similarly for small non-blues (size 1-4, excluding colors 3,8,9) into larger ones, but this ignores color compatibility and can swallow unintended areas.
 * Color adjustments: 4 becomes 6 if directly below a 6 (row-adjacent, column-overlap); 3 becomes 2 if adjacent or overlapping with 2; 5 becomes 9 if "near" (within 2 rows, column-overlap) a 9—these are asymmetric and position-dependent, easy to miss row/column specifics or overlap definitions.
 * Merging: Similar colors (6 and 7) merge if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller; all greens (3) are unconditionally merged into one giant component regardless of position— this can distort spatial relationships.
 * Expansion: Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, increasing size accordingly, but only vertically and without checking overlaps.
 * Filling: Components are filled into a grid by bbox (not exact shape), sorted by size (greens prioritized), skipping color 0; final transpose flips rows/columns, which is crucial but can confuse orientation.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touch (horizontal/vertical, but not diagonal); bbox merging can create rectangular approximations that overfill; no handling for isolated singles or color 0 as background; order of operations matters (e.g., absorb before merge); greens (3) seem special (merged all, prioritized in filling); no diagonal connectivity; potential for infinite loops in while loops if not careful; transposition is always applied, so inputs/outputs have swapped dimensions.
 * Overlooked: Rules may not apply universally—e.g., in training 1, greens should form a large block but code places a small 3; in training 2, 6s and 7s don't merge properly, and 8s/9s shift; color 0 appears as empty in expected but not handled; small components might not always absorb (e.g., if no adjacent large); position matters more than size sometimes (e.g., "below" or "near").
 * General: Puzzle likely tests understanding of spatial rules over strict connectivity; expected outputs show more irregular shapes (non-rectangular fills), suggesting bbox filling is too crude—need exact pixel filling or shape preservation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

# Dict for components: stores color, bbox as tuple (r1,c1,r2,c2), size
# This is useful for tracking regions without full pixel lists
```
```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Standard flood-fill BFS/DFS to find same-color connected components with bbox and size
    # Helpful for initial segmentation; directions are 4-way, visited prevents reprocessing
    # Returns list of dicts; accurate for exact connectivity but bbox approx for later steps
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                # ... (rest as in code)
    return components
```
```python
def bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # Checks overlap or edge-adjacency (horiz/vert, no diagonal); useful for merge/absorb decisions
    # But can false-positive if bboxes touch without actual cell adjacency
    r1, c1, r2, c2 = b1
    r3, c3, r4, c4 = b2
    if max(r1, r3) <= min(r2, r4) and max(c1, c3) <= min(c2, c4):
        return True
    # ... (rest as in code)
    return False
```
```python
def create_filled_grid(components: List[Dict], h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Fills grid with color by bbox, sorted by size (greens boosted); skips 0
    # Helpful for output generation but overfills non-rect shapes; priority favors large/greens
    # Transpose after to match expected orientation
```
* `find_adjacent_components`: Uses bbox overlap+1 for "adjacent"; helpful but loose (includes distant if bbox large).
* `is_below` and `is_near`: Position-specific checks; useful for rule application but hardcoded distances (1 row for below, 2 for near) may not generalize.
* Unhelpful/broken functions: `absorb_small_blues` and `absorb_small_non_blues`—they modify in place and filter out absorbed, but don't update colors/sizes accurately and ignore puzzle-specific absorptions (e.g., don't turn absorbed into absorber's color); lead to lost components. `handle_color_adjustments`—while loop with deepcopy is inefficient and deletes during iteration, risking index errors; transformations are too narrow (e.g., misses 6->something). `merge_similar_colors`—only for 6/7, asymmetric absorption; doesn't handle all cases like training 2's 6/7 split. `merge_all_greens`—unconditional global merge ignores spatial separation, causing over-unification (e.g., disconnected greens in expected). `expand_maroon_components`—vertical-only expansion adds phantom size without filling logic; doesn't check boundaries properly. Overall, these are puzzle-specific guesses that don't align with expected outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single comprehensive attempt with multiple rule functions chained in `program`; it demonstrates understanding of connected components and bbox-based processing but fails all training due to incorrect rule assumptions.
 * Training 1: Generated large 7 blocks on left/top with misplaced small 3, bottom 4/9 blocks shifted right; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s in middle/bottom, 0s as background—code over-absorbed blues/non-blues into 7s, didn't merge greens properly into large block, expanded 8s wrongly, and 4/9 didn't transform correctly; transposition may have oriented wrong.
 * Training 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 8/9 on right; expected has 6s merging across, 8s in middle, 9s bottom-right, 7s top-right—code merged all 3s too aggressively, didn't convert/merge 6/7/8 properly, absorbed smalls into 3s instead of transforming, resulting in no 6/8/9 positions.
 * Training 3: Generated horizontal 6s top, 3/4/8 blocks middle with trailing 4s; expected has 5s top-left, vertical 3s, mixed 7/8/6/4 on sides—code didn't handle 5->9 nearness, kept 4s separate instead of below->6, expanded 8s horizontally wrongly, no 5/7 placement, greens not merged right.
 * Training 4: Generated vertical 2s left, full 6s middle, bottom 2s; expected has horizontal 6s top/bottom, vertical 3s middle, 2s right—code absorbed 2/3 into 6s wrongly, didn't preserve 3s as separate vertical, merged 2s prematurely, no 3 block formation.
 * Common issues: Bbox filling creates rectangles over irregular shapes (e.g., expected has non-full bboxes); absorption/merging too aggressive/generic, ignoring color pairs (e.g., 3+2->2, but code merges greens all); position rules (below/near) under-applied; transposition applied but inputs may need row/col swap consideration; no handling for 0 as explicit empty; size thresholds (4) arbitrary and miss cases; order (absorb -> adjust -> merge) causes cascade errors.
 * `find_connected_components` is essential and correct for extraction; others like `merge_all_greens` are overkill/unhelpful as they ignore adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a large 30-column grid (likely transposed from ~20x30 input) with massive 9 blocks on left/bottom, vertical 2s/6s in middle, small 8s bottom-right, and irregular 7/4 in bottom— but patterns are overly rectangular and uniform, suggesting bbox overfill without shape respect.
 * Issues: Huge 9s dominate left (rows 0-30 cols 0-1, scattered elsewhere), but expected likely has more mixed/spatial merges (e.g., 2s absorbed into 9s?); 6s form tall vertical strip (cols 14-26), but training patterns suggest horizontal/oriented merges; 8s are small clustered bottom-right, but expansion rule may overgrow them; 4s appear as block in bottom-middle without transformation (e.g., to 6 if below); 7s small top-bottom left; overall, lacks subtlety like near-merges or color shifts seen in training expecteds (e.g., no visible 3/5 handling, potential 0 empties missing).
 * Doesn't match expected logic: Based on training, test should show merged greens (3) if present, positioned transformations (e.g., 4 below 6), and non-rect fills; instead, it's blob-like with wrong colors (e.g., persistent 2s/4s not absorbed/transformed); transposition may hide input orientation issues. Unknown why 9s are so pervasive—possibly over-absorption of smalls into 9s—but it disrupts balance seen in expecteds.

[2025-10-03 16:08:57] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

[2025-10-03 16:10:48] Prompt:
We are working on a visual puzzle. Your task is to summarize the last submission, talk about what worked, and what didn't in an effort to find the correct solution.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import copy

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid to swap rows and columns, handling the dimension change."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]

def smooth(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Apply a majority vote filter using 3x3 neighborhood to denoise and smooth the grid.
    Each cell is replaced by the most common color in its local neighborhood."""
    if not g or not g[0]:

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

[2025-10-03 16:11:04] Response:
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the processing of 2D grids of integers (likely representing colored pixels or regions) to transform noisy or patterned inputs into cleaner, structured outputs that reveal shapes, fill regions, or apply geometric rules like symmetry, connectivity, or boundary detection. The goal is to produce exact matches to expected grids, which seem to emphasize uniform region filling, edge preservation, and possibly object extraction or pattern completion across varying grid sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent visual elements like shapes or blobs of colors (integers 0-9), and transformations must preserve overall structure while cleaning noise, such as isolated pixels or irregular boundaries, without over-smoothing large regions.
 * Expected outputs often show sharp, rectangular or stepped region boundaries (e.g., solid blocks of the same number), suggesting rules for flood-filling connected components or propagating colors based on majority in neighborhoods, but with constraints on directionality or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements include handling non-square grids (e.g., training example 2 is 10x10 but output varies in pattern density), maintaining aspect ratios after any rotation/transposition, and avoiding propagation across disconnected regions—e.g., in training 1, expected has distinct horizontal bands of 7,3,0 without vertical bleed.
 * Connectivity is 4-way (up/down/left/right) rather than 8-way, as diagonal fills are not evident in expectations; noise like single pixels (e.g., potential 1s or 2s in inputs) should be absorbed into dominant neighbors but not spread indefinitely.
 * Patterns may involve symmetry or mirroring (e.g., training 4 expected has repeating rows), and color propagation seems biased toward lower rows/columns in some cases, possibly indicating gravity-like settling or top-down filling.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must exactly match row-by-row, including trailing same-color extensions (e.g., training 1 ends with consistent 7s); over-smoothing can merge unrelated regions (seen in generated outputs with excessive 6/7/8 blending).
 * Across attempts, consider irregular shapes like Ls, Ts, or irregular blobs—rules likely involve bounding boxes or contour following to straighten edges.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x16 in training 1, 10x10 in 2 and 4, 9x14 in 3), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; inputs may have noise levels that require iterative but limited passes to avoid total homogenization.
 * Potential rules: Identify "objects" as connected components of the same color, then expand/contract them to fit expected clean shapes; or apply morphological operations like dilation/erosion before filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from collections import Counter
import numpy as np  # Assuming NumPy for easier grid ops, if allowed

def connected_components(g: List[List[int]], i: int, j: int, color: int, visited: List[List[bool]]) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:

    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while stack:
        x, y = stack.pop()
        if 0 <= x < r and 0 <= y < c and not visited[x][y] and g[x][y] == color:
            visited[x][y] = True
            component.append((x, y))
            for dx, dy in directions:
                stack.append((x + dx, y + dy))
    return component

def flood_fill(g: List[List[int]], component: List[Tuple[int, int]], fill_color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill a connected component with a uniform color; useful for cleaning regions."""
    new_g = [row[:] for row in g]
    min_r, max_r = min(p[0] for p in component), max(p[0] for p in component)
    min_c, max_c = min(p[1] for p in component), max(p[1] for p in component)
    # Simple rectangular fill; adjust for irregular shapes if needed
    for i in range(min_r, max_r + 1):
        for j in range(min_c, max_c + 1):
            new_g[i][j] = fill_color
    return new_g

def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]]:
    """Identify all connected components by color, returning (color, positions) pairs for object analysis."""
    r, c = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * c for _ in range(r)]
    objects = []
    for i in range(r):
        for j in range(c):
            if not visited[i][j]:
                color = g[i][j]
                comp = connected_components(g, i, j, color, visited)
                if comp:  # Only if non-empty

    return objects
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used transposition followed by iterative majority-vote smoothing (3x3 neighborhood), which partially denoises small noise but fails to produce structured region fills, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * What worked: Smoothing correctly absorbs some isolated noise (e.g., in training 1, it consolidated lower regions into 4s and 7s, reducing scattered values), and transposition handles orientation swaps, which might be relevant if puzzles involve rotation.
 * What didn't work: Over-smoothing merged distinct regions (e.g., in training 1, generated has gradual gradients of 6->7->8->4 instead of sharp 7/3/0 bands; expected has clear horizontal separation not achieved). In training 2, it failed to isolate small features like 1s or create the expected stepped pattern with 6/8/9. Training 3 generated irregular fills (e.g., partial 3/4/8 blobs) missing the expected clean rows and columns. Training 4 preserved some repetition but incorrectly propagated 2/3/6 without matching the alternating row structure.
 * Transposition alone is unhelpful or broken for these cases, as inputs/outputs don't show consistent row-column swaps (e.g., training 1 expected keeps horizontal bands post-any transform).
 * Majority smoothing function is somewhat helpful for noise reduction but not for the puzzle, as it lacks color-specific rules or connectivity—leads to diffusion rather than precise filling (e.g., in training 1, 6s dominate top where 7s expected).
 * No object extraction was used, missing key for identifying and cleaning blobs; generated outputs show blended colors (e.g., 6/7/8 in training 1) instead of expected pure zones.
 * Iterative smoothing (3 passes) exacerbated blending without boundaries, causing mismatches like training 2's generated 7/8/3/1/5 mess vs. expected clean 6/3/8/9 blocks.
 * extract_objects-like function absent, so no handling of multiple components; this is essential for puzzles with separate regions (e.g., training 3's multiple 3/4/6/8 groups).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a highly irregular, noisy grid with scattered 0/2/3/6/7/8/9 values forming no clear shapes or uniform regions, suggesting over-smoothed chaos rather than structured output (e.g., rows 14-15 have mixed 2/6/9, while earlier rows blend 0/3/6/9 without boundaries).
 * It differs from what we'd expect based on training patterns: likely clean, blocky regions (e.g., large 9 areas with inset 3/6/0/2 shapes, similar to training 1's bands), but generated has jagged edges and unexplained intrusions (e.g., isolated 7s in row 25, 4s in rows 26-29) that don't form expected symmetries or fills—possibly the smoothing propagated noise incorrectly without connectivity rules.
 * No clear propagation or filling observed (e.g., bottom-right 4/8 block looks partial and unmatched to training's uniform ends); this indicates the approach fails on larger, more complex grids with multiple interacting regions.
 * To handle test case, need rules for hierarchical filling (e.g., largest components first) or boundary detection to prevent bleed, as current output homogenizes too much without preserving subtle separations seen in training expectations.

[2025-10-03 16:11:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:14:49] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual denoising puzzle where the input grid contains numbers representing colors or patterns, with 0 and 1 acting as noise or background/foreground artifacts, and the goal is to reconstruct a cleaner, blocky version by identifying large uniform rectangular regions (stripes or blocks) and filling them with the dominant (mode) value while ignoring noise. The output should consist of large, consistent horizontal and vertical blocks of the same number, smoothing out irregularities to reveal an underlying structured pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have noise (0 and 1) that should be ignored when computing modes or dominant values in rows, columns, or segments; never treat 0 or 1 as valid pattern values unless they form a dominant block themselves (which is rare).
 * Identify vertical stripes first by scanning columns and grouping consecutive columns with the same mode (ignoring noise), then subdivide those stripes horizontally into sub-blocks with uniform row modes.
 * Sub-blocks should be rectangular and as large as possible; small anomalies (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s, or minority values) should be overridden by the surrounding dominant value, but consistent minority patterns might indicate separate sub-blocks.
 * Horizontal symmetry or repetition in expected outputs suggests checking for repeated rows or patterns across the grid; vertical stripes may not span the full height, so subdivide vertically within each stripe.
 * Anomalies should be detected but not propagated—use them only to refine boundaries, not to fill the output; top anomalies (e.g., via Counter) can help identify if a block needs splitting but aren't directly used for filling.
 * Transposing the grid (as in the current program) scrambles the structure and doesn't align with blocky expected outputs, which preserve row/column orientations.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-column or single-row grids should mode the entire thing ignoring noise; blocks may abut without separators, and noise can form thin lines or spots that must be smoothed over.
 * Subtle elements: Dominant value in a segment is the most common non-0/1 number; if no non-noise values, default to 0; outputs are always the same dimensions as input; patterns may shift midway (e.g., a vertical stripe changing mode partway down), requiring vertical subdivision.
 * Across attempts, noise often leaks into outputs (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s remain), and blocks aren't fully filled—e.g., in Train 1, generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s with noise, but expected has clean 7/3/0 blocks; ensure filling propagates the mode across the entire detected block.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed because the main program only transposes the grid (via zip(*g)), which rotates it 90 degrees and preserves noise without any denoising or block-filling, leading to scrambled, noisy outputs that don't match the clean, blocky expected grids.
 * Train 1 generated: Mostly 6s/7s/8s with scattered 1s/0s and irregular shapes (e.g., row 0 has ten 6s then 7s/8s; row 3 has a 3 in noise); expected: Clean horizontal blocks of 7s (rows 0-3), 3s (rows 4-6), 0s (rows 7-11) with vertical shifts at columns 10-12—generated mismatches by not filling full blocks and leaking noise (e.g., 1s in expected 7/3 areas).
 * Train 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/3s with heavy noise (e.g., row 1 has 7s then 8s/1s; row 6 has 1s/9s/5s); expected: Top 3 rows full 6s ending in 7s, then 3/8/6/7 blocks with a bottom 3/8/9/7 pattern—generated fails to group into large blocks, keeps 1s/6s as noise instead of smoothing to dominants like 6/7/8/9.
 * Train 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/4s/8s with 1s scattered (e.g., row 1 has 1s in middle; row 7 has 1s/7); expected: Top 3 rows 5s then 3s, middle 7/8/6/3 blocks, bottom 7/8/6/4—generated doesn't detect vertical/horizontal subdivisions properly, resulting in partial fills and noise retention (unknown why 5s appear where 3s expected, possibly from miscomputed modes).
 * Train 4 generated: Irregular 2s/6s/3s with 1s (e.g., row 0 has 2s/6s/1; row 7 has 3s/1s); expected: Top 3 and bottom 3 rows full 6s/2s, middle 7 rows 3s/2s—generated fails to smooth vertical columns into blocks, keeps noise like 1s in 6/3 areas.
 * The stripe-finding and subdivision functions are sketched but unused in the main program, so they don't impact outputs; anomaly detection is helpful for refinement but overkill if not integrated into filling.
 * Transposing is broken and unhelpful— it changes the grid orientation without denoising, worsening matches (don't use in future).
 * No attempts passed, showing incomplete integration of denoising logic; core issue is lack of a full reconstruction step to create a new grid by filling detected blocks with their modes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it remains highly noisy and irregular, with scattered 0s/1s/2s/3s/6s/8s/9s across rows (e.g., row 0 has 14 9s then 14 6s; row 12 has mixed 9s/3s/0s/1s/6s; row 24 has 9s/7s/1s), forming no clear large blocks, whereas a correct output should have smooth, rectangular regions of uniform numbers (e.g., large 9/3/6/2/8/4/7 blocks based on apparent patterns in the input).
 * It appears to be a slightly modified version of the input (possibly transposed or partially processed), but noise persists heavily (e.g., isolated 1s in row 13, 0s in row 14), and structures like potential vertical 9-stripe on left or 6-stripe in middle aren't fully filled or subdivided horizontally.
 * Bottom rows show some blockiness (e.g., row 25 has 9/7s/1s/4s/9s/8s), but it's inconsistent and doesn't align with expected denoising—likely failed because the program doesn't apply stripe/subdivision logic to build a new clean grid.
 * Overall, it makes no sense as a solution; it looks like raw input with minor artifacts rather than a reconstructed puzzle, missing the block-filling to handle test's complex noise (e.g., diagonal-ish 0/1 lines and small 2/8 intrusions that should be smoothed).

[2025-10-03 16:14:49] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integers (likely representing colors, shapes, or connected regions) that must be transformed according to specific pattern-based rules, producing output grids with large uniform blocks or stripes of numbers, often filling or outlining detected structures like blobs or lines. The goal is to recognize and manipulate connected components or regions in the input to match structured, repetitive expected outputs, rather than simple operations like transposition.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The input grids contain scattered numbers (0-9) forming irregular patterns or "blobs" of connected same-valued cells (likely 4-connected or 8-connected), and the output reinterprets these into horizontal bands or blocks of uniform values, suggesting rules for grouping, filling, or mirroring regions.
 * Outputs often feature repeating rows of the same pattern (e.g., entire rows of 7s with a small block of 3s in specific columns), indicating vertical symmetry or replication across rows, but with transitions between block types (e.g., from 7s to 3s to 0s) based on input structure.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have jagged edges or isolated cells (e.g., single 1s or small clusters), but outputs simplify them into clean rectangular blocks, possibly by expanding, contracting, or selecting dominant values per "layer" or section.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so rules must be size-agnostic; outputs preserve dimensions but reorganize content.
 * Connected components seem key: inputs show clusters (e.g., 3s forming shapes), outputs map them to filled regions (e.g., all 3s become a horizontal stripe across multiple rows).
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs may ignore minor outliers (e.g., isolated 1s in inputs don't appear in clean block outputs), prioritize certain values (e.g., 3s or 7s dominate blocks), or apply transformations like reflection (e.g., left-right mirroring of shapes) or projection (e.g., collapsing vertical structures into horizontal ones).
 * Across examples, inputs have "noise" like single cells (1s, 0s) disrupting main blobs, but outputs are noise-free, suggesting filtering or majority-rule filling.
 * Consider orientation: Inputs may have vertical or diagonal alignments that outputs horizontalize.
 * Rule for transitions: Blocks change at specific row counts (e.g., 4 rows of one value, then 3 of another), possibly counting input "layers" or blob heights.
 * No rotation or simple flip evident, as outputs don't match rotated inputs.
 * Values like 0 may represent "empty" or background, filled over in outputs; higher numbers (3,6,7,8,9) form primary structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This function is provided but unhelpful/broken for the puzzle, as it only swaps axes without pattern recognition, leading to scrambled outputs that don't match block structures.)

No other functions were provided or generated in this attempt. Future attempts may need helpers like connected component labeling (e.g., flood-fill to extract blobs) or region filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt solely used transposition, which worked for none of the training examples, producing rotated but unstructured grids that retained input irregularities (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s) instead of clean blocks.
 * Training example 1: Generated a transposed mess with misplaced 1s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions (e.g., row 0 has [6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] but with anomalies like 1s in later rows); expected clean horizontal blocks (4 rows of mostly 7s with 3s in cols 10-12, 3 rows of 3s, 5 rows of 0s with 3s in cols 10-12). Difference: No block formation; transpose preserved noise without filling or grouping.
 * Training example 2: Generated transposed grid with scattered 1s, 3s, 7s, 8s (e.g., row 0 [7,7,7,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]); expected vertical stacks horizontalized into repeating rows (3 rows of 6s ending in 7s, 5 rows of 3s with 8s/6s in cols 3-5 and 7-9, 2 rows of 3s with 8s/9s). Difference: Retained input fragmentation (e.g., isolated 1s appear as-is); no replication of rows or block simplification—unknown why transpose didn't align even partially.
 * Training example 3: Generated irregular transpose with mixed 1s,3s,4s,5s,6s,8s,9s (e.g., row 0 [6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5]); expected structured blocks (3 rows of 5s transitioning to 3s in cols 5-9, then 6 rows with 7/8/6/4 mixtures in specific columns). Difference: No horizontal uniformity; transpose created vertical lines from input but scrambled them, missing row replication and value prioritization (e.g., 3s not expanded to full blocks).
 * Training example 4: Generated transpose with scattered 1s,2s,3s,4s,6s (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4]); expected repeating horizontal blocks (3 rows of 6s ending in 2s, 4 rows of 3s ending in 2s, 3 rows of 6s ending in 2s). Difference: Preserved small clusters without expanding to full-row fills; introduced no new uniformity—transpose irrelevant here as input shapes weren't axis-aligned for simple swap.
 * Overall: Transposition fails to detect or transform blobs, ignores value-based grouping, and doesn't handle row replication or noise removal; it's not relevant to the puzzle (avoid in future).
 * No prior attempts beyond this one; all training mismatches highlight need for blob extraction and filling rules.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it's a direct transpose of the input, resulting in a 30-column x 29-row grid (flipped dimensions) with the same scattered numbers (e.g., rows start with long 9s runs but include anomalies like isolated 1s, 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 7s, 8s in irregular positions, such as row 12 having [9,9,3,3,...,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,6,6,9,9,1,0,1]). This retains input noise and fragmentation without forming the expected clean, repeating horizontal blocks or stripes seen in training outputs (e.g., no large uniform 9/6/3 regions or row replication). It doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as it scrambles the input without simplification, missing core transformations like blob filling or projection—likely needs rules for connected regions and horizontal mapping to handle the test's larger, more complex scattered patterns (e.g., vertical 9s walls, diagonal 0s/1s intrusions).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where input grids of numbers (likely representing colored blocks, shapes, or pixel-like elements) must be processed according to specific rules to produce output grids with structured patterns, such as uniform blocks or aligned regions, rather than simple geometric operations like rotation. The goal appears to be recognizing and reorganizing "objects" or regions in the grid (e.g., blobs of numbers) into a canonical or solved form, possibly simulating a puzzle like sorting, mirroring, or extracting features from visual motifs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Numbers 0-9 likely represent distinct visual elements (e.g., colors, heights, or object types); outputs often consolidate them into large uniform blocks (e.g., rows/columns of the same number), suggesting rules for grouping or propagating values across regions.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes: inputs have scattered or asymmetric placements (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s amid larger blocks), while outputs create symmetric or stacked blocks (e.g., multiple identical rows of 7s followed by 3s and 0s in Training 1), implying detection of boundaries, filling, or projection rules.
 * Outputs preserve some input structure but reorganize: e.g., in Training 1, expected has horizontal bands of 7s, 3s, 0s; in Training 2, vertical stacks with 6s, 3s, 8s, 9s; subtle mismatches occur in blob alignment or extension (e.g., 3s in Training 1 don't stretch fully in generated).
 * Easy-to-miss: Non-uniform regions (e.g., "islands" of numbers like 0s or 1s embedded in larger areas) need special handling—possibly extraction, counting, or replacement—rather than blind transformation; outputs often ignore or simplify small anomalies.
 * Consider edge cases like zero-width rows/columns or disconnected components; rules may involve symmetry (e.g., mirroring across axes) or dominance (e.g., majority number per row/column).
 * Across attempts, rotation/transposition fails because it scrambles positions without respecting semantic grouping (e.g., doesn't create the banded outputs); no evidence of criminal/irrelevant elements, but focus on visual pattern recognition.
 * Outputs are always printed as space-separated lists per row, matching input format.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

from typing import List

def reverse_rows(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Reverse the order of rows in the grid."""
    return g[::-1]
```

    """Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise by reversing rows and transposing."""
    reversed_g = reverse_rows(g)
    rotated = transpose_grid(reversed_g)
    return rotated
```
(Note: These are from the attempt but only marginally helpful for geometric ops; extend to object detection, e.g., flood-fill for blobs, as rotation alone fails.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used 90-degree clockwise rotation via reverse and transpose, which worked for basic geometry but failed entirely on semantics—generated outputs preserve number counts but jumble positions into non-banded, asymmetric messes (e.g., Training 1 generated scattered 8s/7s/6s with misplaced 0/1/3/4/9, vs. expected clean horizontal bands of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Correctly implemented rotation mechanics (e.g., outputs are valid grids of same size with rotated elements), but this doesn't align with puzzle goals.
 * What didn't: Completely mismatched expected patterns—e.g., Training 1 generated vertical-ish stacks with intrusions (like isolated 0/1 in 8/7/6 areas) instead of uniform rows; Training 2 scrambled 8/1/3/5/7/9 into irregular shapes vs. expected vertical 6/3/8/9 bands; Training 3 mixed 5/9/4/8/6/1/7/3 haphazardly vs. horizontal 5/3 then vertical-ish 7/8/6/4; Training 4 disorganized 4/6/1/2/3 into non-stacked form vs. repeating 6/3/2 bands.
 * No object extraction attempted, leading to failure in recognizing regions (e.g., 3s in Training 1 should form a block, but rotation scatters them); subtle differences like partial overlaps (e.g., 1s as "noise" in inputs) are rotated but not resolved.
 * Rotation function is not helpful for the puzzle (don't use in future—it's geometric, not pattern-based); consider adding blob detection or row-majority voting instead.
 * All training examples failed for unknown reasons beyond rotation mismatch (possibly core rule is projection or sorting per axis).
 * No prior unhelpful functions beyond this; avoid pure transforms without semantic checks.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it appears as a rotated/messy version of some input (with sprawling 9/6/8/3/2/1/0/4/7 blocks and scattered anomalies like isolated 1s/0s), lacking the clean, banded structure of training expecteds (e.g., no uniform rows of single numbers stacking logically). 
 * It includes irregularities (e.g., diagonal-ish intrusions of 0/1/8 in 9/6 areas, fragmented 3s/2s) that suggest the rotation scrambled an underlying pattern without extracting or simplifying objects, unlike expecteds' symmetry.
 * Differences are stark: e.g., top rows mix 9/6 with trailing 3/9, vs. likely expected horizontal bands; bottom has clustered 4/7/1 amid 8/9, probably wrong as it doesn't consolidate into large uniform regions.
 * Does not make sense—looks like raw rotation artifacts (e.g., 30-column width implies non-square input rotated), missing puzzle's apparent rule of grouping/simplifying visual motifs; to fix, need rules for detecting dominant regions and propagating (e.g., fill small holes or align blobs vertically/horizontally).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual grid transformation puzzle where the input is a 2D grid of integers (likely representing colors or symbols), and the goal is to output a new grid that fills contiguous regions or strips with a single representative number (e.g., the mode or a dominant value), creating large uniform blocks while preserving some structural patterns like horizontal bands or grouped columns/rows. The transformation emphasizes grouping and filling based on column or row modes, but the current program fails by merely transposing the grid without applying any meaningful filling logic.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle involves identifying modes (most frequent values) in columns or rows to group and fill vertical or horizontal strips, but outputs show horizontal blocks in expected results (e.g., entire rows filled with the same number across wide spans), suggesting a row-wise or region-filling rule rather than strict column grouping.
 * Subtle elements include handling varying block sizes (e.g., in training 1, blocks of 10x4 for 7s, then 4x3 for 3s, then 10x3 for 0s), transitions between blocks (e.g., sharp changes at specific rows/columns), and preserving relative positions of different values without scattering them (generated outputs scatter values randomly, unlike expected uniform blocks).
 * Expected outputs maintain grid dimensions but consolidate values into larger monochromatic regions, possibly by propagating the mode horizontally across rows or vertically in columns; subtle misses include over-relying on vertical modes without horizontal filling, leading to fragmented outputs.
 * All training examples have rectangular block structures (e.g., training 2 has 3 rows of 6s, then 5 rows of mixed but blocky 3/8/6/7, ending with 2 rows of 3/8/9/7), implying rules for detecting and filling bounded regions rather than global transposes.
 * Edge cases: Empty or single-row/column grids should return empty; varying grid sizes (e.g., training 1 is 12x16, training 2 is 10x10) require flexible row/column handling; numbers range 0-9, so modes must handle ties (current code picks max key, but may need specific tie-breaking).
 * Outputs must exactly match dimensions and positions—e.g., in training 3, top 3 rows are all 5s in first 5 cols then 3s; no rotation or mirroring, just transformation in place.
 * Potential rule: Group consecutive columns with the same mode and fill entire row spans with that mode, but adjust for horizontal propagation; current approach ignores this, leading to no filling.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.

    However, broken for the puzzle as it doesn't handle row-wise filling or horizontal blocks in expected outputs—don't use as core logic without major changes.
    """
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return []
    n_rows = len(grid)
    n_cols = len(grid[0])
    groups = []

    while i < n_cols:
        mode = compute_mode([grid[r][i] for r in range(n_rows)])
        j = i
        while j < n_cols:
            col_mode = compute_mode([grid[r][j] for r in range(n_rows)])
            if col_mode != mode:
                break
            j += 1
        groups.append((mode, j - i))
        i = j
    return groups
```

The main `program` function is unhelpful/broken: it only transposes the grid (`transposed = [[g[r][c] for r in range(n_rows)] for c in range(n_cols)]`) without using the mode/grouping logic, resulting in outputs that are just rotated inputs—irrelevant to the puzzle (avoid in future; replace with actual filling based on groups).

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed (INCORRECT), with generated outputs being near-direct transposes of inputs, scattering values into non-blocky patterns (e.g., training 1 generated mixes 6/7/8/1/0/3/4/9 randomly across rows, vs. expected clean blocks of 7s, 3s, 0s).
 * What worked: Mode computation correctly identifies frequent values (e.g., would detect 7 as mode in many columns of training 1), and column grouping partially captures vertical similarities (e.g., groups of same-mode cols), providing a foundation for strip detection.
 * What didn't work: No filling or block creation—outputs remain fragmented and don't consolidate into uniform regions (e.g., training 1 expected first 4 rows all 7s in cols 0-9, then 3s in 10-12, but generated has inconsistent 6s/1s/3s/9s); transpose ignores grouping entirely, leading to row-column swaps that break horizontal block expectations.
 * Training 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical-ish lines of same numbers (from transpose) but no wide horizontal fills; expected has perfect row uniformity in blocks—unknown why transpose was chosen over using groups for filling.
 * Training 2 mismatches: Generated scatters 7/8/3/1/6/9/5 without blocks (e.g., row 0 has [7,7,7,8,8,8,...] vs. expected all 6s in first 8 cols); fails to create the 3-row 6-block or 5-row 3/8/6 block.
 * Training 3 mismatches: Generated mixes 6/5/9/3/1/4/8/7 into small clusters (e.g., row 0 [6,6,6,...5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform 5s then 3s); misses the 3-row top block of 5/3 and mid-block transitions to 7/8/6/4.
 * Training 4 mismatches: Generated has short runs of 2/6/1/3/4 (e.g., row 0 [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected 7-col 6-block then 3-col 2-block); no consistent horizontal filling for the alternating 6/3/2 bands.
 * Column grouping function is partially helpful for vertical analysis but not for horizontal block outputs—extend it to fill rows based on group modes.
 * Transpose logic is completely unhelpful and broken for this puzzle (causes all mismatches; discard it).
 * No extraction of "objects" or regions attempted, but expected outputs suggest needing connected-component-like filling (e.g., flood-fill modes horizontally within vertical groups)—future attempts should add region detection.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct—it appears to be a partial transpose or row-reversal of the input, resulting in scattered small groups of numbers (e.g., long runs of 9s mixed with 3/0/1/8/2/6/7/4 in irregular patterns, like row 0 with 14 9s then 14 6s, but row 12 has erratic 9/3/0/2/1/6) without the uniform large blocks seen in training expecteds.
 * It fails to consolidate into horizontal monochromatic strips (e.g., no full rows of single values like training 1's 7-blocks; instead, values like 9s dominate but are interrupted by outliers like 1/8/2, suggesting no mode-propagation rule applied).
 * Differences from expected pattern: Based on training, test should likely have wide horizontal bands (e.g., top rows of 9s, mid of 3/0/6, bottom of 4/8), but generated has vertical-ish artifacts from transpose and no filling, making it fragmented and non-blocky—unknown exact expected for test, but this doesn't match puzzle's blocky transformation style.
 * To handle test: Account for large initial 9-regions (first ~13 rows heavy on 9/3/0), mid-transitions with 2/6/1/8, and bottom 4/7/9/8 blocks by grouping columns and filling rows horizontally with group modes.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations on numbered matrices (likely representing pixel-like colors or labels), where the goal is to apply a specific operation—possibly rotation, reflection, or pattern realignment—to produce output grids with large, uniform blocks of numbers that form structured, symmetric, or layered patterns, as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The expected outputs consistently feature large contiguous blocks of identical numbers (e.g., rows or sections fully filled with 7s, 3s, 0s, 6s, or 8s), suggesting the transformation preserves or creates rectangular regions rather than scattering values.
 * Subtle elements include handling irregular shapes or "blobs" of numbers that may not span the full grid width/height; for instance, in Training 1, the expected has vertical stacks of 7s transitioning to 3s and 0s without fragmentation, while generated outputs fragment them horizontally/vertically due to transposition.
 * Rotations (e.g., 90/180/270 degrees) or mirroring might be involved, as expected patterns resemble rotated versions of potential input blobs; easy to miss that simple transposes swap rows/columns but don't account for reordering or direction (clockwise vs. counterclockwise).
 * Connected components or "objects" (groups of same-number cells) need extraction and manipulation; subtle rule: only certain numbers (e.g., non-zero or specific labels) form valid objects, and isolated cells (like single 1s) may be noise or separators.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., Training 1: 12x16, Training 2: 10x10, etc.), so functions must handle rectangular grids dynamically without assuming squares.
 * Padding or boundary handling: Expected outputs often have aligned edges (e.g., full-width blocks), implying zero-padding or cropping might be needed for alignment.
 * All training examples emphasize vertical/horizontal striping or layering (e.g., top-heavy with one number, bottom with another), so transformations should prioritize axis-aligned realignment over diagonal or scattered effects.
 * Easy to miss: Numbers like 1, 0, or 9 may act as "fillers," "holes," or boundaries; in Training 3, expected has clean transitions between 5s, 3s, 6s, and 4s, without the scattered 1s/8s in generated.
 * Considerations across attempts: No input grids are shown, only outputs, so reverse-engineering from expected vs. generated is key; potential for multiple steps (e.g., detect regions, then rotate each).
 * Irrelevant subtleties to avoid: Pure flattening or listing doesn't help, as outputs must remain 2D grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The only attempt used a basic transpose_grid function, which swapped rows and columns but failed to realign blocks correctly, producing scattered, non-uniform rows (e.g., in Training 1, generated has mixed 6s/7s/8s/1s/0s per row, while expected has pure blocks like full rows of 7s or 0s).
 * What worked: Transpose correctly handles empty grids and preserves all values without loss; it's a building block for rotations (e.g., transpose + reverse = 90-degree rotate).
 * What didn't work: It scrambles spatial relationships, turning vertical blocks into horizontal fragments (e.g., Training 1 generated row [6,6,6,...,7,7,7,8,8,8] vs. expected full [7,7,7,...,7,7,7]; similar fragmentation in all trainings).
 * Training 1: Generated mismatches block transitions (e.g., expected has 4 rows of 7s + 3s, then 0s; generated has irregular 6s bleeding into 7s/8s; unknown why 1s/3s/9s appear as artifacts, possibly from input noise not handled).
 * Training 2: Generated has scattered 1s/3s/5s/9s (e.g., row [7,7,7,8,8,1,1,1,8,8] vs. expected clean [6,6,6,...,7,7]), failing to consolidate into expected 6/3/8/9 layers.
 * Training 3: Generated fragments 5s/3s/6s/4s with extra 1s/8s/9s (e.g., row [6,6,6,...,5,9,9,9,5] vs. expected uniform [5,5,5,...,3,3,3,...]), missing vertical stacking.
 * Training 4: Generated scatters 2s/6s/3s/1s (e.g., row [2,2,2,6,6,1,6,4,4,4] vs. expected layered [6,6,6,...,2,2,2]), disrupting block purity.
 * Function `transpose_grid` is partially helpful as a primitive but broken for this puzzle (produces incorrect orientations; don't use standalone—combine with reverses or rotates).
 * No extraction of objects was attempted, which is essential for handling blob-like patterns in inputs; pure grid ops ignore regional semantics.
 * Missed: All attempts ignore potential rotation direction or mirroring, leading to mismatched alignments (e.g., expected often has "top-to-bottom" gradients not captured by left-to-right transpose).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears as a heavily fragmented, irregular grid with scattered 9s, 6s, 3s, 0s, 1s, 2s, 8s, and 7s/4s in later rows (e.g., row [9,9,9,...,6,6,6,...,9,9,9] mixes values without forming blocks, and lower rows like [9,9,3,1,3,3,3,0,0,1,1,2,...] have chaotic insertions of singles like 1/8).
 * It fails to produce the uniform, blocky structure implied by training expecteds (e.g., no large pure-9 or pure-6 sections; instead, noise like isolated 1s/0s/2s suggests unhandled "holes" or boundaries).
 * Differences: Expected likely has layered blocks (e.g., top-heavy 9s transitioning to 6s/3s like in Training 1/2), but generated is a transposed jumble without consolidation; unknown why specific artifacts (e.g., 1s in positions 7-8 of row 6) appear, possibly from input irregularities not filtered.
 * To handle test: Need region detection to group same-numbers, then rotate/realign each; account for larger size (~30 cols) and potential multi-blob inputs with separators (e.g., 0s as voids).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 1/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid transformations where scattered or patterned numbers in an input grid are resolved into structured blocks or bands of uniform values, likely based on dominance, frequency, or regional grouping rules rather than global uniform filling. The goal appears to be creating clean, horizontal or block-like patterns that preserve some aspects of the original structure, such as partial extensions or transitions between values.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The transformation seems to involve identifying horizontal bands or rows/sections where a dominant value (possibly mode or majority) fills most of the space, but with subtle extensions or overrides in specific columns (e.g., in training example 1, 7s extend into the right side of 3 and 0 blocks, and 3s appear in a middle band with partial 7s).
 * Not all rows become fully uniform; instead, patterns show vertical consistency in columns while allowing horizontal segmentation (e.g., training example 2 has repeating rows with mixed blocks like 6s transitioning to 7s or 9s in specific positions, not full-row fills).
 * Ties in frequency or modes may favor certain values (e.g., maximum value in ties, as attempted), but the rule isn't purely row/column mode— it might require regional analysis, like connected components or blobs of similar values.
 * Grids have varying sizes (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must handle arbitrary dimensions without assuming fixed shapes.
 * Subtle elements: Outputs often repeat the same row pattern multiple times vertically (e.g., 4 identical rows of a pattern in example 1), suggesting vertical stacking or propagation of horizontal decisions; transitions between blocks aren't abrupt but can have overlaps (e.g., example 3 has mixed values in middle rows before uniform 6s and 4s).
 * Potential for "scattered patterns" to simplify into "clean horizontal bands," but not via simple transpose-and-fill, as that loses positional details like the 3s interrupting 7s in example 1.
 * No evidence of rotation, mirroring, or non-numeric operations; focus on integer values (0-9) and their grouping.
 * Easy to miss: The output preserves some original positional relationships (e.g., right-side columns in example 1 keep 7s across changing bands), and not everything is filled uniformly—minority values can dominate in sub-regions.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid, swapping rows and columns."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is useful for analyzing columns if the rule involves vertical dominance, but over-reliance leads to errors as seen.)

```python
def compute_mode(column: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Computes the mode (most frequent value) of a list of integers.
    Returns 0 for empty list; in case of ties, returns the maximum value.
    """
    count = Counter(column)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=lambda k: (count[k], k))
```
(This handles frequency-based decisions with tie-breaking, which aligns with potential dominance rules, but needs adaptation for regions, not full rows/columns.)

```python
def fill_row_with_mode(row: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fills a row with its computed mode value.
    Handles the transformation rule of uniform filling based on row dominance.
    """
    mode = compute_mode(row)
    return [mode for _ in row]
```
(This simplifies patterns to uniforms, which partially captures "clean bands" but fails on partial fills and positional preservation; not sufficient alone.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt used transpose then mode-fill on transposed rows, creating fully uniform horizontal bands in the output (e.g., entire rows of 6s, 7s, 4s in training 1), which worked for simplifying scattered values into blocks but failed to preserve mixed patterns like the 3s interrupting 7s or the right-side 7 extensions in training example 1.
 * In training example 1, generated all-6s (top), all-7s (middle), all-4s (bottom) blocks, but expected has vertical repetition of mixed rows (e.g., 7s with partial 3s and 7s on right, then 3s with 7s on right, then 0s with 3s and 7s), so it over-uniformized and ignored column-specific propagations.
 * Training example 2 generated stacked uniform rows (8s, 3s, 7s, etc.), but expected has repeating mixed blocks (e.g., 6s transitioning to 7s on right, with 8s and 9s in middle sections), missing horizontal segmentation and vertical consistency in sub-columns.
 * Training example 3 generated uniform 6s and 4s blocks with a single 1s row, but expected has top uniform 5s/3s bands transitioning to mixed middle rows (7/8/6/3/6/4 patterns) before uniform bottoms, so it collapsed diverse middle rows incorrectly.
 * Training example 4 generated scattered uniform rows (6s, 4s, 1s, 3s), but expected has repeating 6/2 and 3/2 blocks vertically, indicating failure to group and propagate patterns across multiple rows.
 * Transpose was helpful for column analysis but combined with full-row fill made outputs too simplistic, losing regional details; compute_mode is relevant for dominance but needs per-segment application, not whole rows.
 * No object extraction functions were used or proposed, but the puzzle might benefit from identifying "blobs" or connected regions of values (unexplored so far); fill_row_with_mode is partially helpful for uniform bands but broken for mixed rows—don't use it without segmentation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it consists of fully uniform long rows (30 elements each) of single values (9s, 6s, 0s, 2s, 4s) stacked vertically into large blocks, which mirrors the over-simplification seen in training examples and ignores likely mixed or segmented patterns.
 * It generates a top row of all 9s (unusual, as inputs probably don't have such dominance), then blocks of 6s (3 rows), 0s (4 rows), 9s (4 rows), 0s (1 row), 9s (1 row), 2s (8 rows), 9s (4 rows), 4s (4 rows), suggesting the transpose-mode-fill blindly propagated column modes without considering horizontal variations or regional rules.
 * This doesn't make sense for the puzzle, as expected outputs from training show repeated but mixed rows (e.g., partial fills in columns), not monolithic blocks; it likely mismatches by not handling transitions or sub-regions, making the output too uniform and grid-filling without subtlety.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving transformation of input grids composed of colored blocks (integers 0-9 representing colors or background) into output grids through rules like filling holes, expanding or repositioning small shapes, resolving overlaps, and possibly rotating or resizing the grid to match output patterns. The goal is to identify and apply consistent rules across examples to produce structured block arrangements in the outputs, often simplifying or reorganizing components while preserving dominant colors and shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Small blue shapes (1's, 1-4 pixels) appear embedded or adjacent to larger blocks and are filled by the nearest non-1 color using flood-fill (BFS), but this must be precise to avoid over-filling or altering large blocks unexpectedly.
 * Positional overlaps in larger blocks are resolved by dominance, such as taking the max color in a local neighborhood, but this can lead to uniform spreading if not bounded correctly; subtle overlaps may require component-based merging rather than local max.
 * Small non-blue shapes (e.g., 3's, 9's with <5 pixels) are expanded into adjacent larger blocks or repositioned, but expansions should be limited and directionally aware (e.g., toward dominant areas) to avoid infinite growth or incorrect absorption.
 * Maroon blocks (8's) tend to migrate to bottom or side positions in outputs, suggesting a repositioning rule like shifting to lower rows/columns, but this must account for grid size changes and avoid overwriting other elements.
 * Light blue (9's, small and nested) may emerge or expand inward from enclosures, checking for uniform surrounding colors, but only if fully nested (all 4 directions same non-9); partial nesting or edge cases can break this.
 * Outputs often have consistent dimensions or transpositions (e.g., rotating the grid), with blocks stretching vertically/horizontally; background (0's) fills unused areas, and small components may disappear or merge entirely.
 * Color counts and connectivity matter: large components (>5 pixels) dominate, small ones are absorbed or moved; 4-connectivity for floods, but 8-connectivity might be needed for diagonals in some shapes.
 * Grid sizes vary (e.g., inputs 10x10 to 30x?, outputs rectangular blocks), so rules must handle padding with 0's and potential transposition/resize at the end.
 * Subtle: Some colors like 3's or 9's invert positions (top to bottom), 8's cluster at edges; avoid assuming all small shapes behave the same—9's may stay nested while 3's expand/merge.
 * All examples show simplification: complex nested inputs become layered horizontal/vertical bands of colors, with no isolated small pixels in outputs.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The program applies a sequence of filling, adjustment, expansion, repositioning, enclosure handling, and transpose, but all training examples failed, indicating over-application or incorrect order of rules.
 * Training example 1: Generated large top blocks of 6/7 with misplaced 9's/4's/8's at bottom, but expected vertical bands of 7/3 with 0's filling lower areas; missed repositioning 3's to mid-bottom and eliminating small 4/9 intrusions, over-expanded 8's incorrectly.
 * Training example 2: Generated scattered 7/8/6/3 with misplaced 5's, but expected structured 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 layers; failed to merge small 3's into bands, incorrectly positioned 8's and introduced non-existent 5's (likely from bad adjustment).
 * Training example 3: Generated horizontal 6/9/3/4/8 bands with 0's, but expected mixed 5/3/7/8/6/4 layers; incorrectly introduced 5's (not in input?) and failed to create the specific vertical stacking with 3's dominating mid-section.
 * Training example 4: Generated vertical 2/6/3/4 bands, but expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers with 2's at right; missed horizontal reorganization and stretching of 6's across rows.
 * handle_position_color_adjustment (max in 3x3) caused unwanted spreading (e.g., uniform 7's in ex1), not helpful—replace with component merging.
 * expand_small_non_blue over-expands without proper limits or directionality, leading to blob distortion (e.g., small 3's overtaking areas in ex2); broken for large grids.
 * reposition_maroon_blocks moves 8's arbitrarily without preserving counts or avoiding overlaps, causing bottom clutter (ex1); not helpful as is—needs target position calculation based on output patterns.
 * handle_light_blue_enclosure checks nesting but expands outward incorrectly, creating artifacts (e.g., 9's leaking in ex1); subtle nesting detection misses edges, making it unreliable.
 * Overall, sequence starts with filling (somewhat correct for 1's) but cascades errors; no object extraction, so rules apply pixel-wise instead of shape-wise, missing connected components.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output is a 30x30 grid (inferred from rows) with messy, irregular bands of 9's dominating left/top, interspersed with 6's, 3's, 2's, 8's, and scattered 0's/7's/4's, lacking the clean horizontal/vertical block structure seen in expected training outputs.
 * It does not look correct: Expected outputs have uniform, stretched color bands (e.g., full-row 7's or 6's with sharp transitions), but this has jagged edges, isolated pixels (e.g., single 7's), and over-proliferated 9's/8's without clear layering; likely from faulty filling/expansion propagating errors across the large input.
 * Missing simplification: Input has complex nesting (3's in 9's, 2's in 0's, 8's at bottom-right), but output should resolve to banded layers (e.g., 9's as background enclosure, 6's as mid-band, 2's/3's repositioned); instead, it retains too much input chaos.
 * Does not match test considerations: Large size suggests need for scalable rules (e.g., component sizes), but output has uneven 0-fills and misplaced small colors (4's/7's appearing erroneously), indicating broken color propagation.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 2/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of integers that appear to represent noisy images or patterns (e.g., blocky shapes or regions of uniform values like letters, numbers, or symbols), where the task is to apply transformations to denoise or clean the input grid, revealing coherent, structured blocks of identical values as seen in the expected outputs.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The inputs are noisy versions of structured grids with rectangular or block-like regions of the same number (e.g., large uniform areas separated by boundaries), and the goal is to propagate dominant values across regions while suppressing outliers or noise without over-smoothing across distinct boundaries.
 * Expected outputs preserve sharp edges between different regions (e.g., horizontal/vertical lines of transition) and expand or fill uniform blocks consistently across rows/columns, often resulting in symmetric or repeating patterns like stacked rectangles.
 * Subtle elements include handling edges/corners differently (e.g., fewer neighbors), resolving ties in mode by favoring maximum values, and avoiding bleed-over between adjacent but distinct regions (e.g., a single outlier shouldn't propagate to dominate a whole block).
 * Transposition is used to reorient vertical structures horizontally for processing, but over-application of smoothing can blur boundaries or incorrectly fill regions (e.g., turning isolated noise into false extensions).
 * Patterns often involve decreasing or increasing value gradients vertically/horizontally, with some regions "growing" downward or rightward in the expectations.
 * Noise includes scattered single values or small clusters that should be overwritten by surrounding majorities, but smoothing must be directional or iterative to match exact block shapes.
 * Grids vary in size (e.g., 10x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; empty or zero values may represent backgrounds that should expand but not override foregrounds.
 * Iterative smoothing (multiple passes) might be needed for propagation, but single passes as in the attempt cause incomplete fills.
 * No rotation or scaling is evident; focus on local neighborhood consensus (e.g., 3x3 or linear neighbors) to build larger structures.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

    count = Counter(lst)

            neighbors.append(row[i + 1])
        smoothed[i] = compute_mode(neighbors)
    return smoothed
```
(This is helpful for 1D denoising but insufficient alone; extend to 2D neighborhoods for better block preservation.)

```python
def smooth_grid_vertical(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """
    Smooths each column vertically by treating columns as rows and applying smooth_row.
    This rule handles vertical noise reduction, complementing horizontal smoothing.

    n_cols = len(g[0])

        for i in range(n_rows):
            smoothed[i][j] = smoothed_col[i]

```
(This complements row smoothing but causes over-smoothing in vertical directions, blurring expected sharp horizontal bands.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """

    This core transformation reorients the input to align vertical structures horizontally.
    """
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(col) for col in zip(*g)]
```
(This is potentially useful for handling asymmetric noise but in the attempt, applying it once before smoothing misaligns structures, leading to incorrect propagation.)

(No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; future attempts might need flood-fill or region-growing to identify and clean blocks explicitly, as simple neighbor mode doesn't capture connected components well.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * The attempt used transposition followed by horizontal row smoothing and then vertical column smoothing, aiming for noise reduction via local modes, but this over-smoothed and incorrectly propagated values across boundaries, failing to produce the blocky, uniform regions in expectations.
 * In Training 1, generated output created uniform top bands of 6/7/8 and bottom bands of 4/7/8 with scattered 9s, but expected clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0 with sharp vertical offsets (e.g., columns 11-13 as 3s, rest 7s in top; full 3s in middle; 0/3 in bottom)—the smoothing filled too much horizontally after transpose, ignoring vertical block integrity.
 * In Training 2, generated irregular bands of 7/8/3/5/9 with jagged edges (e.g., row 4 has 7s then 3s; row 9 has mixed 3/6), but expected structured blocks like top 6s, middle 3/8/6 bands, and bottom 3/8/9/7—transpose + smoothing created false vertical fills (e.g., 9s appearing where 6s should dominate).
 * In Training 3, generated mixed 6/4/3/8/5/9 with incomplete blocks (e.g., row 1 all 6/9; row 4 has 6/4/8), but expected top 5/3 bands, middle 7/8/6/3/6/4—smoothing failed to expand 3s leftward or align vertical columns properly, leaving noise like isolated 5s.
 * In Training 4, generated descending 2/6/3 bands with irregularities (e.g., row 5 has 2/1/6; row 7 has 3/6/3), but expected uniform top/middle/bottom 6/3/2 blocks with repeating rows—vertical smoothing overwrote horizontal patterns, creating false 1s and uneven fills.
 * No training sample passed, indicating the linear neighbor mode (only left/right or up/down) doesn't capture 2D locality well; needs fuller neighborhoods or region-based filling.
 * The compute_mode tie-breaker (max value) sometimes favors high numbers incorrectly (e.g., 9s over 6s in test), but it's not the core issue—lack of iteration or boundary detection is.
 * Transpose is helpful for reorientation but applying it rigidly without inverse or multiple steps misaligns outputs (e.g., expected patterns aren't transposed back).
 * Simple smoothing functions like smooth_row and smooth_grid_vertical are partially helpful for local noise but broken for global structure—they propagate too aggressively without respecting block connectivity, leading to smeared results; not sufficient alone, but could be built upon with iterations or masks.
 * No object extraction was attempted, which might be essential for identifying dominant regions (e.g., flood-fill to find connected components of same value and expand them); current approach treats all pixels equally, missing this.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it remains highly noisy with scattered values (e.g., isolated 0s, 2s, 3s, 6s, 8s, 9s in irregular clusters) and incomplete fills (e.g., row 0 has long 9s then 6s/7s/8s; rows 14-24 show patchy 0/2/6/9/8 bands with jagged edges like single 7s or 4s), failing to form the clean, rectangular blocks seen in training expectations.
 * Unlike expectations' uniform horizontal bands (e.g., full rows of same value or clear column-wise shifts), the output has over-propagated 9s in corners/top and fragmented middle regions (e.g., 0s not fully expanding to background blocks; 2s forming small irregular shapes instead of solid areas), suggesting the transpose + dual smoothing smeared noise without resolving underlying structures.
 * It doesn't make sense as a cleaned puzzle—looks more like partially denoised input than a solved pattern (e.g., no coherent shapes like letters/symbols emerge; values like 4s and 7s appear as outliers where 9/6/8/0/3/2 should dominate blocks).
 * To handle test case, need to prevent boundary bleed (e.g., 9s invading 6/0 areas) and promote vertical consistency (e.g., expand 3s downward fully); current method's single-pass linear smoothing can't achieve this, as seen in persistent scatter.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a puzzle involving transforming input grids of integers (likely representing pixel colors or labels in a visual pattern) into output grids that simplify or correct the structure, emphasizing blocky, uniform regions while preserving distinct shapes and boundaries of "objects" or blobs, possibly through region filling, noise removal, or segmentation rules that propagate values selectively rather than uniformly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Outputs consistently show large uniform blocks of the same number (e.g., long stretches of 7s, 3s, or 9s), suggesting the goal is to expand or fill connected regions into rectangular or structured shapes, but without over-smoothing across unrelated areas.
 * Boundaries between regions must be sharp and respected; for example, in training example 1 expected output, there's a clear vertical stack of 7s on the right, with a thin 3-column band of 3s separating upper and lower sections, and a bottom band of 0s—generated output instead bleeds 6s and 4s incorrectly into these areas.
 * Grids may be non-square, and transposition is used in the program for dimension matching, but this seems to distort orientations; expected outputs maintain the input's row/column structure without flipping.
 * Iterative application is key for propagation, but the number of iterations (size//6 +1) is too aggressive or insufficient, leading to incomplete filling (e.g., in training example 2, generated has scattered 1s and 5s persisting, while expected has clean bands of 6s, 3s, 8s, and 9s).
 * Mode computation favors the maximum in ties, which may bias toward higher numbers (e.g., 9s dominating in test output), but expected outputs sometimes prioritize lower or specific values (e.g., 0s in example 1 bottom, 3s over others).
 * Edge handling in neighborhoods is basic (using available cells), but subtle: corners/edges should not leak values from distant regions; generated outputs show unwanted propagation (e.g., in example 3, 4s and 8s mix incorrectly, while expected has distinct horizontal bands and vertical alignments like 3s and 6s).
 * No global rules like thresholding or connectivity (e.g., 4-connected vs 8-connected) are applied; outputs suggest flood-fill-like behavior for blobs, but only within implied shapes—e.g., example 4 expected has repeating 6/3/2 bands vertically, but generated scatters 1s and uneven 6s.
 * Subtle element: Outputs preserve some asymmetry or "stair-step" boundaries (e.g., example 2 expected has 9s only in bottom-right), but smoothing erases them; also, empty or zero areas (like 0s in example 1) must remain as backgrounds, not filled.
 * Across attempts (this is the primary one shown), no object extraction is done—grids seem to contain multiple "objects" (blobs of numbers) that need individual processing, like identifying connected components before filling.
 * Considerations: Inputs may have noise (scattered single cells), which should be removed by majority in local regions, but not globally; test input has complex shapes (e.g., a large 9 background with embedded 3s, 0s, 2s, 6s, 4s, 7s, 8s), suggesting hierarchical filling where backgrounds expand but inner shapes hold.

(This is a core smoothing tool that works for local denoising but fails on global structure; useful as a building block, but needs integration with region detection.)

No object extraction functions were provided or attempted; a function like `extract_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[List[int]]]` (returning blobs) would be essential for isolating and filling shapes separately, as pure smoothing mixes everything.

The main `program` function combines transpose and iterative smoothing, which is a reasonable start for propagation but broken for boundary preservation—don't rely on it as-is.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt uses iterative 2D mode-based smoothing after optional transpose, which partially works for expanding uniform regions (e.g., large 9 blocks in test output mimic background filling) but fails to preserve distinct blob shapes and introduces unwanted bleeding (e.g., 6s overwriting 0/3 areas).
 * Transposition for non-square grids mismatches orientations; in example 1 (12x16 input implied), it likely flips rows/columns, causing horizontal bands to become vertical incorrectly.
 * Smoothing iterations (size//6 +1) are too few or mismatched; example 2 generated leaves noise like 1s and 5s, while expected cleans to solid bands—propagation doesn't reach far enough or respects connectivity wrong.
 * Mode tie-breaking to max value biases high numbers (e.g., 8/9 dominating in example 3 generated vs. expected 3/6/4 bands).
 * No handling for background (0s) or specific value priorities; example 1 generated fills bottom with 4s instead of 0s, and upper with 6s instead of 7s.
 * Example 4 generated has uneven 6s and persistent 1s in a place expected to be clean 3s/2s, showing poor noise removal in sparse areas.
 * Overall, approach understands local majority but misses global rules like connected-component filling or shape recognition—e.g., all trainings have blocky, aligned rectangles in expected, but generated has jagged remnants.
 * Function `smooth_grid_2d` is helpful but incomplete (lacks connectivity); `transpose` may be irrelevant or harmful (don't use unless dimensions demand it); no unhelpful functions beyond that, but pure iteration without seeding or masking is not sufficient.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it over-smooths into massive 9/6/8/4/2/7 blocks with some jagged edges (e.g., scattered 0s and 2s in the middle persist partially, but large areas like the top-left 9s and bottom-right 4s expand too far), losing distinct embedded shapes like the 3-blob, 0-void, and 2-strip in the input.
 * It resembles aggressive denoising but ignores subtle boundaries—e.g., the input's vertical 3-column of 3s and horizontal 0/2 bands get partially erased into surrounding 9s/6s, while expected (inferred from trainings) should maintain clean, rectangular fills for each region without crossover (e.g., 0s as background voids, 2s as a thin inner strip).
 * Compared to trainings, it repeats the error of bleeding values (like 9s overwriting 3s/7s), and the structure doesn't align to blocky patterns—e.g., the right-side 7/4 areas mix into 9s incorrectly; this suggests the program would fail if the test expected preserved object separations.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color transformation, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, position, and specific color interactions, then fill and transpose the resulting grid to match an expected output pattern. The rules seem to simulate "object" simplification or unification in a 2D spatial puzzle, possibly inspired by image segmentation or blob analysis, but with custom color-specific behaviors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and must be of the exact same color; bounding boxes (bbox) are used to approximate regions for adjacency checks, but this can lead to over-merging if not precise (e.g., diagonal or distant touches aren't handled).
 * Small components (size <=4) of blue (1) are absorbed into adjacent non-blues, prioritizing the largest; similarly for small non-blues (size 1-4, excluding colors 3,8,9) into larger ones, but this ignores color compatibility and can swallow unintended areas.
 * Color adjustments: 4 becomes 6 if directly below a 6 (row-adjacent, column-overlap); 3 becomes 2 if adjacent or overlapping with 2; 5 becomes 9 if "near" (within 2 rows, column-overlap) a 9—these are asymmetric and position-dependent, easy to miss row/column specifics or overlap definitions.
 * Merging: Similar colors (6 and 7) merge if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller; all greens (3) are unconditionally merged into one giant component regardless of position— this can distort spatial relationships.
 * Expansion: Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, increasing size accordingly, but only vertically and without checking overlaps.
 * Filling: Components are filled into a grid by bbox (not exact shape), sorted by size (greens prioritized), skipping color 0; final transpose flips rows/columns, which is crucial but can confuse orientation.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touch (horizontal/vertical, but not diagonal); bbox merging can create rectangular approximations that overfill; no handling for isolated singles or color 0 as background; order of operations matters (e.g., absorb before merge); greens (3) seem special (merged all, prioritized in filling); no diagonal connectivity; potential for infinite loops in while loops if not careful; transposition is always applied, so inputs/outputs have swapped dimensions.
 * Overlooked: Rules may not apply universally—e.g., in training 1, greens should form a large block but code places a small 3; in training 2, 6s and 7s don't merge properly, and 8s/9s shift; color 0 appears as empty in expected but not handled; small components might not always absorb (e.g., if no adjacent large); position matters more than size sometimes (e.g., "below" or "near").
 * General: Puzzle likely tests understanding of spatial rules over strict connectivity; expected outputs show more irregular shapes (non-rectangular fills), suggesting bbox filling is too crude—need exact pixel filling or shape preservation.

* `find_adjacent_components`: Uses bbox overlap+1 for "adjacent"; helpful but loose (includes distant if bbox large).
* `is_below` and `is_near`: Position-specific checks; useful for rule application but hardcoded distances (1 row for below, 2 for near) may not generalize.
* Unhelpful/broken functions: `absorb_small_blues` and `absorb_small_non_blues`—they modify in place and filter out absorbed, but don't update colors/sizes accurately and ignore puzzle-specific absorptions (e.g., don't turn absorbed into absorber's color); lead to lost components. `handle_color_adjustments`—while loop with deepcopy is inefficient and deletes during iteration, risking index errors; transformations are too narrow (e.g., misses 6->something). `merge_similar_colors`—only for 6/7, asymmetric absorption; doesn't handle all cases like training 2's 6/7 split. `merge_all_greens`—unconditional global merge ignores spatial separation, causing over-unification (e.g., disconnected greens in expected). `expand_maroon_components`—vertical-only expansion adds phantom size without filling logic; doesn't check boundaries properly. Overall, these are puzzle-specific guesses that don't align with expected outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single comprehensive attempt with multiple rule functions chained in `program`; it demonstrates understanding of connected components and bbox-based processing but fails all training due to incorrect rule assumptions.
 * Training 1: Generated large 7 blocks on left/top with misplaced small 3, bottom 4/9 blocks shifted right; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s in middle/bottom, 0s as background—code over-absorbed blues/non-blues into 7s, didn't merge greens properly into large block, expanded 8s wrongly, and 4/9 didn't transform correctly; transposition may have oriented wrong.
 * Training 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 8/9 on right; expected has 6s merging across, 8s in middle, 9s bottom-right, 7s top-right—code merged all 3s too aggressively, didn't convert/merge 6/7/8 properly, absorbed smalls into 3s instead of transforming, resulting in no 6/8/9 positions.
 * Training 3: Generated horizontal 6s top, 3/4/8 blocks middle with trailing 4s; expected has 5s top-left, vertical 3s, mixed 7/8/6/4 on sides—code didn't handle 5->9 nearness, kept 4s separate instead of below->6, expanded 8s horizontally wrongly, no 5/7 placement, greens not merged right.
 * Training 4: Generated vertical 2s left, full 6s middle, bottom 2s; expected has horizontal 6s top/bottom, vertical 3s middle, 2s right—code absorbed 2/3 into 6s wrongly, didn't preserve 3s as separate vertical, merged 2s prematurely, no 3 block formation.
 * Common issues: Bbox filling creates rectangles over irregular shapes (e.g., expected has non-full bboxes); absorption/merging too aggressive/generic, ignoring color pairs (e.g., 3+2->2, but code merges greens all); position rules (below/near) under-applied; transposition applied but inputs may need row/col swap consideration; no handling for 0 as explicit empty; size thresholds (4) arbitrary and miss cases; order (absorb -> adjust -> merge) causes cascade errors.
 * `find_connected_components` is essential and correct for extraction; others like `merge_all_greens` are overkill/unhelpful as they ignore adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a large 30-column grid (likely transposed from ~20x30 input) with massive 9 blocks on left/bottom, vertical 2s/6s in middle, small 8s bottom-right, and irregular 7/4 in bottom— but patterns are overly rectangular and uniform, suggesting bbox overfill without shape respect.
 * Issues: Huge 9s dominate left (rows 0-30 cols 0-1, scattered elsewhere), but expected likely has more mixed/spatial merges (e.g., 2s absorbed into 9s?); 6s form tall vertical strip (cols 14-26), but training patterns suggest horizontal/oriented merges; 8s are small clustered bottom-right, but expansion rule may overgrow them; 4s appear as block in bottom-middle without transformation (e.g., to 6 if below); 7s small top-bottom left; overall, lacks subtlety like near-merges or color shifts seen in training expecteds (e.g., no visible 3/5 handling, potential 0 empties missing).
 * Doesn't match expected logic: Based on training, test should show merged greens (3) if present, positioned transformations (e.g., 4 below 6), and non-rect fills; instead, it's blob-like with wrong colors (e.g., persistent 2s/4s not absorbed/transformed); transposition may hide input orientation issues. Unknown why 9s are so pervasive—possibly over-absorption of smalls into 9s—but it disrupts balance seen in expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the processing of 2D grids of integers (likely representing colored pixels or regions) to transform noisy or patterned inputs into cleaner, structured outputs that reveal shapes, fill regions, or apply geometric rules like symmetry, connectivity, or boundary detection. The goal is to produce exact matches to expected grids, which seem to emphasize uniform region filling, edge preservation, and possibly object extraction or pattern completion across varying grid sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent visual elements like shapes or blobs of colors (integers 0-9), and transformations must preserve overall structure while cleaning noise, such as isolated pixels or irregular boundaries, without over-smoothing large regions.
 * Expected outputs often show sharp, rectangular or stepped region boundaries (e.g., solid blocks of the same number), suggesting rules for flood-filling connected components or propagating colors based on majority in neighborhoods, but with constraints on directionality or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements include handling non-square grids (e.g., training example 2 is 10x10 but output varies in pattern density), maintaining aspect ratios after any rotation/transposition, and avoiding propagation across disconnected regions—e.g., in training 1, expected has distinct horizontal bands of 7,3,0 without vertical bleed.
 * Connectivity is 4-way (up/down/left/right) rather than 8-way, as diagonal fills are not evident in expectations; noise like single pixels (e.g., potential 1s or 2s in inputs) should be absorbed into dominant neighbors but not spread indefinitely.
 * Patterns may involve symmetry or mirroring (e.g., training 4 expected has repeating rows), and color propagation seems biased toward lower rows/columns in some cases, possibly indicating gravity-like settling or top-down filling.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must exactly match row-by-row, including trailing same-color extensions (e.g., training 1 ends with consistent 7s); over-smoothing can merge unrelated regions (seen in generated outputs with excessive 6/7/8 blending).
 * Across attempts, consider irregular shapes like Ls, Ts, or irregular blobs—rules likely involve bounding boxes or contour following to straighten edges.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x16 in training 1, 10x10 in 2 and 4, 9x14 in 3), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; inputs may have noise levels that require iterative but limited passes to avoid total homogenization.
 * Potential rules: Identify "objects" as connected components of the same color, then expand/contract them to fit expected clean shapes; or apply morphological operations like dilation/erosion before filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used transposition followed by iterative majority-vote smoothing (3x3 neighborhood), which partially denoises small noise but fails to produce structured region fills, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * What worked: Smoothing correctly absorbs some isolated noise (e.g., in training 1, it consolidated lower regions into 4s and 7s, reducing scattered values), and transposition handles orientation swaps, which might be relevant if puzzles involve rotation.
 * What didn't work: Over-smoothing merged distinct regions (e.g., in training 1, generated has gradual gradients of 6->7->8->4 instead of sharp 7/3/0 bands; expected has clear horizontal separation not achieved). In training 2, it failed to isolate small features like 1s or create the expected stepped pattern with 6/8/9. Training 3 generated irregular fills (e.g., partial 3/4/8 blobs) missing the expected clean rows and columns. Training 4 preserved some repetition but incorrectly propagated 2/3/6 without matching the alternating row structure.
 * Transposition alone is unhelpful or broken for these cases, as inputs/outputs don't show consistent row-column swaps (e.g., training 1 expected keeps horizontal bands post-any transform).
 * Majority smoothing function is somewhat helpful for noise reduction but not for the puzzle, as it lacks color-specific rules or connectivity—leads to diffusion rather than precise filling (e.g., in training 1, 6s dominate top where 7s expected).
 * No object extraction was used, missing key for identifying and cleaning blobs; generated outputs show blended colors (e.g., 6/7/8 in training 1) instead of expected pure zones.
 * Iterative smoothing (3 passes) exacerbated blending without boundaries, causing mismatches like training 2's generated 7/8/3/1/5 mess vs. expected clean 6/3/8/9 blocks.
 * extract_objects-like function absent, so no handling of multiple components; this is essential for puzzles with separate regions (e.g., training 3's multiple 3/4/6/8 groups).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a highly irregular, noisy grid with scattered 0/2/3/6/7/8/9 values forming no clear shapes or uniform regions, suggesting over-smoothed chaos rather than structured output (e.g., rows 14-15 have mixed 2/6/9, while earlier rows blend 0/3/6/9 without boundaries).
 * It differs from what we'd expect based on training patterns: likely clean, blocky regions (e.g., large 9 areas with inset 3/6/0/2 shapes, similar to training 1's bands), but generated has jagged edges and unexplained intrusions (e.g., isolated 7s in row 25, 4s in rows 26-29) that don't form expected symmetries or fills—possibly the smoothing propagated noise incorrectly without connectivity rules.
 * No clear propagation or filling observed (e.g., bottom-right 4/8 block looks partial and unmatched to training's uniform ends); this indicates the approach fails on larger, more complex grids with multiple interacting regions.
 * To handle test case, need rules for hierarchical filling (e.g., largest components first) or boundary detection to prevent bleed, as current output homogenizes too much without preserving subtle separations seen in training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual denoising puzzle where the input grid contains numbers representing colors or patterns, with 0 and 1 acting as noise or background/foreground artifacts, and the goal is to reconstruct a cleaner, blocky version by identifying large uniform rectangular regions (stripes or blocks) and filling them with the dominant (mode) value while ignoring noise. The output should consist of large, consistent horizontal and vertical blocks of the same number, smoothing out irregularities to reveal an underlying structured pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have noise (0 and 1) that should be ignored when computing modes or dominant values in rows, columns, or segments; never treat 0 or 1 as valid pattern values unless they form a dominant block themselves (which is rare).
 * Identify vertical stripes first by scanning columns and grouping consecutive columns with the same mode (ignoring noise), then subdivide those stripes horizontally into sub-blocks with uniform row modes.
 * Sub-blocks should be rectangular and as large as possible; small anomalies (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s, or minority values) should be overridden by the surrounding dominant value, but consistent minority patterns might indicate separate sub-blocks.
 * Horizontal symmetry or repetition in expected outputs suggests checking for repeated rows or patterns across the grid; vertical stripes may not span the full height, so subdivide vertically within each stripe.
 * Anomalies should be detected but not propagated—use them only to refine boundaries, not to fill the output; top anomalies (e.g., via Counter) can help identify if a block needs splitting but aren't directly used for filling.
 * Transposing the grid (as in the current program) scrambles the structure and doesn't align with blocky expected outputs, which preserve row/column orientations.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-column or single-row grids should mode the entire thing ignoring noise; blocks may abut without separators, and noise can form thin lines or spots that must be smoothed over.
 * Subtle elements: Dominant value in a segment is the most common non-0/1 number; if no non-noise values, default to 0; outputs are always the same dimensions as input; patterns may shift midway (e.g., a vertical stripe changing mode partway down), requiring vertical subdivision.
 * Across attempts, noise often leaks into outputs (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s remain), and blocks aren't fully filled—e.g., in Train 1, generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s with noise, but expected has clean 7/3/0 blocks; ensure filling propagates the mode across the entire detected block.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed because the main program only transposes the grid (via zip(*g)), which rotates it 90 degrees and preserves noise without any denoising or block-filling, leading to scrambled, noisy outputs that don't match the clean, blocky expected grids.
 * Train 1 generated: Mostly 6s/7s/8s with scattered 1s/0s and irregular shapes (e.g., row 0 has ten 6s then 7s/8s; row 3 has a 3 in noise); expected: Clean horizontal blocks of 7s (rows 0-3), 3s (rows 4-6), 0s (rows 7-11) with vertical shifts at columns 10-12—generated mismatches by not filling full blocks and leaking noise (e.g., 1s in expected 7/3 areas).
 * Train 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/3s with heavy noise (e.g., row 1 has 7s then 8s/1s; row 6 has 1s/9s/5s); expected: Top 3 rows full 6s ending in 7s, then 3/8/6/7 blocks with a bottom 3/8/9/7 pattern—generated fails to group into large blocks, keeps 1s/6s as noise instead of smoothing to dominants like 6/7/8/9.
 * Train 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/4s/8s with 1s scattered (e.g., row 1 has 1s in middle; row 7 has 1s/7); expected: Top 3 rows 5s then 3s, middle 7/8/6/3 blocks, bottom 7/8/6/4—generated doesn't detect vertical/horizontal subdivisions properly, resulting in partial fills and noise retention (unknown why 5s appear where 3s expected, possibly from miscomputed modes).
 * Train 4 generated: Irregular 2s/6s/3s with 1s (e.g., row 0 has 2s/6s/1; row 7 has 3s/1s); expected: Top 3 and bottom 3 rows full 6s/2s, middle 7 rows 3s/2s—generated fails to smooth vertical columns into blocks, keeps noise like 1s in 6/3 areas.
 * The stripe-finding and subdivision functions are sketched but unused in the main program, so they don't impact outputs; anomaly detection is helpful for refinement but overkill if not integrated into filling.
 * Transposing is broken and unhelpful— it changes the grid orientation without denoising, worsening matches (don't use in future).
 * No attempts passed, showing incomplete integration of denoising logic; core issue is lack of a full reconstruction step to create a new grid by filling detected blocks with their modes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it remains highly noisy and irregular, with scattered 0s/1s/2s/3s/6s/8s/9s across rows (e.g., row 0 has 14 9s then 14 6s; row 12 has mixed 9s/3s/0s/1s/6s; row 24 has 9s/7s/1s), forming no clear large blocks, whereas a correct output should have smooth, rectangular regions of uniform numbers (e.g., large 9/3/6/2/8/4/7 blocks based on apparent patterns in the input).
 * It appears to be a slightly modified version of the input (possibly transposed or partially processed), but noise persists heavily (e.g., isolated 1s in row 13, 0s in row 14), and structures like potential vertical 9-stripe on left or 6-stripe in middle aren't fully filled or subdivided horizontally.
 * Bottom rows show some blockiness (e.g., row 25 has 9/7s/1s/4s/9s/8s), but it's inconsistent and doesn't align with expected denoising—likely failed because the program doesn't apply stripe/subdivision logic to build a new clean grid.
 * Overall, it makes no sense as a solution; it looks like raw input with minor artifacts rather than a reconstructed puzzle, missing the block-filling to handle test's complex noise (e.g., diagonal-ish 0/1 lines and small 2/8 intrusions that should be smoothed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not grid:
        return 0, 0

    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return h, w
```
Basic grid dimensions utility, useful for bounds checking.

    # (Full implementation as in the program: BFS to find non-blue components and separately blue components)
    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-10-03 16:17:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that appears to involve simplifying a noisy or detailed grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty and 1 as holes) into a cleaner, blocky representation of larger rectangular regions dominated by a single color per block, likely by identifying and expanding dominant color modes while ignoring or filling insignificant elements like isolated cells or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent images with colors (integers 2+), 0s as empty space to ignore in mode calculations, and 1s as "holes" that need filling with nearby colors, but filling must preserve overall block structures rather than blending everything.
 * Dominant colors in columns or rows should form "stripes" or sub-blocks, but the process must handle irregular shapes: vertical/horizontal grouping should be based on modes of non-0 cells, yet avoid over-generalizing across breaks in patterns (e.g., don't merge columns with the same mode if interrupted by different dominant regions).
 * Transposition (rotating the grid) is applied at the end, suggesting the simplification might need to work in a specific orientation (e.g., vertical stripes first, then horizontal subdivision), but this can distort results if the initial direction is wrong—subtleties include checking if horizontal stripes or no transpose would better match expected blocky outputs.
 * 0s in expected outputs indicate preserved empty space, so the simplification should not fill everything; blocks should only expand to cover areas where a color truly dominates, leaving gaps as 0.
 * Subtle elements: Modes must ignore 0s but not overcount minorities; BFS for hole-filling works for proximity but fails if it propagates wrong colors across boundaries (e.g., in training 1, it seems to flood 6s and 7s incorrectly into areas that should be 3s or 0s). Patterns often have asymmetric blocks (e.g., L-shapes or offsets), so rigid rectangular subdivision misses curves or steps. Expected outputs show crisp, uniform blocks without noise, implying a need to detect and uniformize regions beyond simple modes—consider connected components or flood-fill for true blobs rather than column/row modes.
 * Across attempts, no handling for multi-color transitions within stripes (e.g., training 2 has mixed 3,6,8 but generated merges wrongly); also, widths/heights of blocks must match exactly (e.g., training 3 generated irregular 4s and 6s where expected has clean horizontal bands).
 * General: Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; test input is larger (28x30?), with complex nested patterns including 0s as separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter, deque

def fill_holes(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all 1's with the nearest non-1 color using multi-source BFS."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    grid = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    q = deque()
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if grid[i][j] != 1:
                q.append((i, j, grid[i][j]))
                visited[i][j] = True
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        x, y, color = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                grid[nx][ny] = color
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny, color))
    return grid
```
(This BFS hole-filling is helpful for proximity-based completion but needs refinement to avoid over-propagation across block boundaries; useful as a preprocessing step.)

```python
def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:
    """Compute mode ignoring 0."""
    count = Counter(x for x in lst if x != 0)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This mode function is core and helpful for identifying dominant colors in rows/columns/segments, ignoring 0s correctly; should be retained and possibly extended to weighted or thresholded modes.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(Transposition is helpful for reorienting if the puzzle requires processing in rows vs. columns, but in this attempt it's applied too late or wrongly, leading to mismatches; consider applying earlier or conditionally.)

(Note: No explicit object extraction function was in this attempt, but one could be added for blob detection via flood-fill to identify connected components of same color, which might better capture non-rectangular blocks before rectangular approximation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples by producing over-smoothed or misaligned blocky grids: e.g., in Train 1, generated uniform horizontal bands of 6/7/4/9 (ignoring expected vertical shifts to 3s and bottom 0s), likely due to vertical stripe grouping propagating modes across row changes incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated merged 7s and 3s into incorrect positions (e.g., top 7s where expected has 6s, and scattered 5s at bottom), missing the expected stepped pattern with 8/6/9 transitions—subdivision didn't capture horizontal offsets.
 * Train 3: Generated repetitive 6/3/4/8 patterns with irregularities (e.g., isolated 5/9 intrusions), while expected has clean horizontal stripes (5/3 then 7/8/6/4 bands); mode computation in sub-blocks failed to uniformize vertical variations.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical stacks of 2/6/4/3 but with inconsistent widths (e.g., 2s not spanning full expected height), missing the expected alternating 6/3/2 bands—stripe finding didn't handle row-mode changes properly within columns.
 * Overall, what worked: Hole-filling via BFS correctly propagates colors locally (no unfilled 1s in outputs), and mode computation ignores 0s appropriately; vertical stripe detection groups similar columns somewhat (e.g., right-side consistencies in Train 1).
 * What didn't work: Build_blocky_grid overfills rectangles without respecting pattern breaks (e.g., creates solid blocks where expected has 0 gaps or color shifts); transpose at end rotates results wrongly, e.g., Train 1 expected is vertical bands but generated looks horizontal post-transpose. Subdivision is too rigid, missing subtle mode changes. No handling for 0 preservation in output. Function find_vertical_stripes is somewhat helpful but broken for non-uniform heights; subdivide_stripe_vertically is unhelpful as it recomputes modes per row-segment without considering full-block connectivity (leads to fragmentation). No object extraction, which might be needed for true block identification—consider adding flood-fill for blobs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a highly uniform, overfilled grid dominated by 9s, 3s, 6s, and 2s in large rectangular bands (e.g., top-heavy 9s, vertical 3/6 stripes, scattered 8s/4s/7s at bottom), but ignores the input's complex structure with 0-separated regions, offsets, and mixed colors (e.g., input has clustered 2s, isolated 0s as dividers, and diagonal-ish transitions around rows 7-22). This results in loss of detail like the input's bottom-right 8s block and mid-grid 2s cluster, replaced by smoothed modes; expected should likely preserve more stepped/offset blocks (e.g., expanding 9s only where dominant, leaving 0 gaps, and uniformizing 2s/6s without bleeding). It doesn't make sense as a simplification because it merges unrelated areas (e.g., top 9s flood into mid-3s), suggesting the vertical-first approach and hole-filling propagate too aggressively without boundary detection.

[2025-10-03 16:17:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

        return g

                if g[i][j] == 1:
                    adjacent_green = any(
                        0 <= i + di < r and 0 <= j + dj < c and g[i + di][j + dj] == 3
                        for di, dj in directions
                    )

```

```python
def expand_other(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Attempts to fill remaining 1's with adjacent non-1 colors, picking the first one found.
    # Partially helpful for basic filling, but broken as it doesn't consider distance, majority, or prevent cycles/overwrites; leads to arbitrary colors.

                        if 0 <= ni < r and 0 <= nj < c and g[ni][nj] != 1:
                            color = g[ni][nj]
                            break
                    new_g[i][j] = color
                    if new_g[i][j] != 1:
                        changed = True
        g = new_g
    return g
```

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Simple matrix transpose; helpful for final orientation if the puzzle requires row-column swap.
    # Not broken, but application after expansions mismatches expected block alignments.
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color transformation, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, position, and specific color interactions, then fill and transpose the resulting grid to match an expected output pattern. The rules seem to simulate "object" simplification or unification in a 2D spatial puzzle, possibly inspired by image segmentation or blob analysis, but with custom color-specific behaviors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and must be of the exact same color; bounding boxes (bbox) are used to approximate regions for adjacency checks, but this can lead to over-merging if not precise (e.g., diagonal or distant touches aren't handled).
 * Small components (size <=4) of blue (1) are absorbed into adjacent non-blues, prioritizing the largest; similarly for small non-blues (size 1-4, excluding colors 3,8,9) into larger ones, but this ignores color compatibility and can swallow unintended areas.
 * Color adjustments: 4 becomes 6 if directly below a 6 (row-adjacent, column-overlap); 3 becomes 2 if adjacent or overlapping with 2; 5 becomes 9 if "near" (within 2 rows, column-overlap) a 9—these are asymmetric and position-dependent, easy to miss row/column specifics or overlap definitions.
 * Merging: Similar colors (6 and 7) merge if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller; all greens (3) are unconditionally merged into one giant component regardless of position— this can distort spatial relationships.
 * Expansion: Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, increasing size accordingly, but only vertically and without checking overlaps.
 * Filling: Components are filled into a grid by bbox (not exact shape), sorted by size (greens prioritized), skipping color 0; final transpose flips rows/columns, which is crucial but can confuse orientation.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touch (horizontal/vertical, but not diagonal); bbox merging can create rectangular approximations that overfill; no handling for isolated singles or color 0 as background; order of operations matters (e.g., absorb before merge); greens (3) seem special (merged all, prioritized in filling); no diagonal connectivity; potential for infinite loops in while loops if not careful; transposition is always applied, so inputs/outputs have swapped dimensions.
 * Overlooked: Rules may not apply universally—e.g., in training 1, greens should form a large block but code places a small 3; in training 2, 6s and 7s don't merge properly, and 8s/9s shift; color 0 appears as empty in expected but not handled; small components might not always absorb (e.g., if no adjacent large); position matters more than size sometimes (e.g., "below" or "near").
 * General: Puzzle likely tests understanding of spatial rules over strict connectivity; expected outputs show more irregular shapes (non-rectangular fills), suggesting bbox filling is too crude—need exact pixel filling or shape preservation.

* `find_adjacent_components`: Uses bbox overlap+1 for "adjacent"; helpful but loose (includes distant if bbox large).
* `is_below` and `is_near`: Position-specific checks; useful for rule application but hardcoded distances (1 row for below, 2 for near) may not generalize.
* Unhelpful/broken functions: `absorb_small_blues` and `absorb_small_non_blues`—they modify in place and filter out absorbed, but don't update colors/sizes accurately and ignore puzzle-specific absorptions (e.g., don't turn absorbed into absorber's color); lead to lost components. `handle_color_adjustments`—while loop with deepcopy is inefficient and deletes during iteration, risking index errors; transformations are too narrow (e.g., misses 6->something). `merge_similar_colors`—only for 6/7, asymmetric absorption; doesn't handle all cases like training 2's 6/7 split. `merge_all_greens`—unconditional global merge ignores spatial separation, causing over-unification (e.g., disconnected greens in expected). `expand_maroon_components`—vertical-only expansion adds phantom size without filling logic; doesn't check boundaries properly. Overall, these are puzzle-specific guesses that don't align with expected outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single comprehensive attempt with multiple rule functions chained in `program`; it demonstrates understanding of connected components and bbox-based processing but fails all training due to incorrect rule assumptions.
 * Training 1: Generated large 7 blocks on left/top with misplaced small 3, bottom 4/9 blocks shifted right; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s in middle/bottom, 0s as background—code over-absorbed blues/non-blues into 7s, didn't merge greens properly into large block, expanded 8s wrongly, and 4/9 didn't transform correctly; transposition may have oriented wrong.
 * Training 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 8/9 on right; expected has 6s merging across, 8s in middle, 9s bottom-right, 7s top-right—code merged all 3s too aggressively, didn't convert/merge 6/7/8 properly, absorbed smalls into 3s instead of transforming, resulting in no 6/8/9 positions.
 * Training 3: Generated horizontal 6s top, 3/4/8 blocks middle with trailing 4s; expected has 5s top-left, vertical 3s, mixed 7/8/6/4 on sides—code didn't handle 5->9 nearness, kept 4s separate instead of below->6, expanded 8s horizontally wrongly, no 5/7 placement, greens not merged right.
 * Training 4: Generated vertical 2s left, full 6s middle, bottom 2s; expected has horizontal 6s top/bottom, vertical 3s middle, 2s right—code absorbed 2/3 into 6s wrongly, didn't preserve 3s as separate vertical, merged 2s prematurely, no 3 block formation.
 * Common issues: Bbox filling creates rectangles over irregular shapes (e.g., expected has non-full bboxes); absorption/merging too aggressive/generic, ignoring color pairs (e.g., 3+2->2, but code merges greens all); position rules (below/near) under-applied; transposition applied but inputs may need row/col swap consideration; no handling for 0 as explicit empty; size thresholds (4) arbitrary and miss cases; order (absorb -> adjust -> merge) causes cascade errors.
 * `find_connected_components` is essential and correct for extraction; others like `merge_all_greens` are overkill/unhelpful as they ignore adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a large 30-column grid (likely transposed from ~20x30 input) with massive 9 blocks on left/bottom, vertical 2s/6s in middle, small 8s bottom-right, and irregular 7/4 in bottom— but patterns are overly rectangular and uniform, suggesting bbox overfill without shape respect.
 * Issues: Huge 9s dominate left (rows 0-30 cols 0-1, scattered elsewhere), but expected likely has more mixed/spatial merges (e.g., 2s absorbed into 9s?); 6s form tall vertical strip (cols 14-26), but training patterns suggest horizontal/oriented merges; 8s are small clustered bottom-right, but expansion rule may overgrow them; 4s appear as block in bottom-middle without transformation (e.g., to 6 if below); 7s small top-bottom left; overall, lacks subtlety like near-merges or color shifts seen in training expecteds (e.g., no visible 3/5 handling, potential 0 empties missing).
 * Doesn't match expected logic: Based on training, test should show merged greens (3) if present, positioned transformations (e.g., 4 below 6), and non-rect fills; instead, it's blob-like with wrong colors (e.g., persistent 2s/4s not absorbed/transformed); transposition may hide input orientation issues. Unknown why 9s are so pervasive—possibly over-absorption of smalls into 9s—but it disrupts balance seen in expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the processing of 2D grids of integers (likely representing colored pixels or regions) to transform noisy or patterned inputs into cleaner, structured outputs that reveal shapes, fill regions, or apply geometric rules like symmetry, connectivity, or boundary detection. The goal is to produce exact matches to expected grids, which seem to emphasize uniform region filling, edge preservation, and possibly object extraction or pattern completion across varying grid sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent visual elements like shapes or blobs of colors (integers 0-9), and transformations must preserve overall structure while cleaning noise, such as isolated pixels or irregular boundaries, without over-smoothing large regions.
 * Expected outputs often show sharp, rectangular or stepped region boundaries (e.g., solid blocks of the same number), suggesting rules for flood-filling connected components or propagating colors based on majority in neighborhoods, but with constraints on directionality or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements include handling non-square grids (e.g., training example 2 is 10x10 but output varies in pattern density), maintaining aspect ratios after any rotation/transposition, and avoiding propagation across disconnected regions—e.g., in training 1, expected has distinct horizontal bands of 7,3,0 without vertical bleed.
 * Connectivity is 4-way (up/down/left/right) rather than 8-way, as diagonal fills are not evident in expectations; noise like single pixels (e.g., potential 1s or 2s in inputs) should be absorbed into dominant neighbors but not spread indefinitely.
 * Patterns may involve symmetry or mirroring (e.g., training 4 expected has repeating rows), and color propagation seems biased toward lower rows/columns in some cases, possibly indicating gravity-like settling or top-down filling.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must exactly match row-by-row, including trailing same-color extensions (e.g., training 1 ends with consistent 7s); over-smoothing can merge unrelated regions (seen in generated outputs with excessive 6/7/8 blending).
 * Across attempts, consider irregular shapes like Ls, Ts, or irregular blobs—rules likely involve bounding boxes or contour following to straighten edges.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x16 in training 1, 10x10 in 2 and 4, 9x14 in 3), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; inputs may have noise levels that require iterative but limited passes to avoid total homogenization.
 * Potential rules: Identify "objects" as connected components of the same color, then expand/contract them to fit expected clean shapes; or apply morphological operations like dilation/erosion before filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used transposition followed by iterative majority-vote smoothing (3x3 neighborhood), which partially denoises small noise but fails to produce structured region fills, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * What worked: Smoothing correctly absorbs some isolated noise (e.g., in training 1, it consolidated lower regions into 4s and 7s, reducing scattered values), and transposition handles orientation swaps, which might be relevant if puzzles involve rotation.
 * What didn't work: Over-smoothing merged distinct regions (e.g., in training 1, generated has gradual gradients of 6->7->8->4 instead of sharp 7/3/0 bands; expected has clear horizontal separation not achieved). In training 2, it failed to isolate small features like 1s or create the expected stepped pattern with 6/8/9. Training 3 generated irregular fills (e.g., partial 3/4/8 blobs) missing the expected clean rows and columns. Training 4 preserved some repetition but incorrectly propagated 2/3/6 without matching the alternating row structure.
 * Transposition alone is unhelpful or broken for these cases, as inputs/outputs don't show consistent row-column swaps (e.g., training 1 expected keeps horizontal bands post-any transform).
 * Majority smoothing function is somewhat helpful for noise reduction but not for the puzzle, as it lacks color-specific rules or connectivity—leads to diffusion rather than precise filling (e.g., in training 1, 6s dominate top where 7s expected).
 * No object extraction was used, missing key for identifying and cleaning blobs; generated outputs show blended colors (e.g., 6/7/8 in training 1) instead of expected pure zones.
 * Iterative smoothing (3 passes) exacerbated blending without boundaries, causing mismatches like training 2's generated 7/8/3/1/5 mess vs. expected clean 6/3/8/9 blocks.
 * extract_objects-like function absent, so no handling of multiple components; this is essential for puzzles with separate regions (e.g., training 3's multiple 3/4/6/8 groups).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a highly irregular, noisy grid with scattered 0/2/3/6/7/8/9 values forming no clear shapes or uniform regions, suggesting over-smoothed chaos rather than structured output (e.g., rows 14-15 have mixed 2/6/9, while earlier rows blend 0/3/6/9 without boundaries).
 * It differs from what we'd expect based on training patterns: likely clean, blocky regions (e.g., large 9 areas with inset 3/6/0/2 shapes, similar to training 1's bands), but generated has jagged edges and unexplained intrusions (e.g., isolated 7s in row 25, 4s in rows 26-29) that don't form expected symmetries or fills—possibly the smoothing propagated noise incorrectly without connectivity rules.
 * No clear propagation or filling observed (e.g., bottom-right 4/8 block looks partial and unmatched to training's uniform ends); this indicates the approach fails on larger, more complex grids with multiple interacting regions.
 * To handle test case, need rules for hierarchical filling (e.g., largest components first) or boundary detection to prevent bleed, as current output homogenizes too much without preserving subtle separations seen in training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual denoising puzzle where the input grid contains numbers representing colors or patterns, with 0 and 1 acting as noise or background/foreground artifacts, and the goal is to reconstruct a cleaner, blocky version by identifying large uniform rectangular regions (stripes or blocks) and filling them with the dominant (mode) value while ignoring noise. The output should consist of large, consistent horizontal and vertical blocks of the same number, smoothing out irregularities to reveal an underlying structured pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have noise (0 and 1) that should be ignored when computing modes or dominant values in rows, columns, or segments; never treat 0 or 1 as valid pattern values unless they form a dominant block themselves (which is rare).
 * Identify vertical stripes first by scanning columns and grouping consecutive columns with the same mode (ignoring noise), then subdivide those stripes horizontally into sub-blocks with uniform row modes.
 * Sub-blocks should be rectangular and as large as possible; small anomalies (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s, or minority values) should be overridden by the surrounding dominant value, but consistent minority patterns might indicate separate sub-blocks.
 * Horizontal symmetry or repetition in expected outputs suggests checking for repeated rows or patterns across the grid; vertical stripes may not span the full height, so subdivide vertically within each stripe.
 * Anomalies should be detected but not propagated—use them only to refine boundaries, not to fill the output; top anomalies (e.g., via Counter) can help identify if a block needs splitting but aren't directly used for filling.
 * Transposing the grid (as in the current program) scrambles the structure and doesn't align with blocky expected outputs, which preserve row/column orientations.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-column or single-row grids should mode the entire thing ignoring noise; blocks may abut without separators, and noise can form thin lines or spots that must be smoothed over.
 * Subtle elements: Dominant value in a segment is the most common non-0/1 number; if no non-noise values, default to 0; outputs are always the same dimensions as input; patterns may shift midway (e.g., a vertical stripe changing mode partway down), requiring vertical subdivision.
 * Across attempts, noise often leaks into outputs (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s remain), and blocks aren't fully filled—e.g., in Train 1, generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s with noise, but expected has clean 7/3/0 blocks; ensure filling propagates the mode across the entire detected block.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed because the main program only transposes the grid (via zip(*g)), which rotates it 90 degrees and preserves noise without any denoising or block-filling, leading to scrambled, noisy outputs that don't match the clean, blocky expected grids.
 * Train 1 generated: Mostly 6s/7s/8s with scattered 1s/0s and irregular shapes (e.g., row 0 has ten 6s then 7s/8s; row 3 has a 3 in noise); expected: Clean horizontal blocks of 7s (rows 0-3), 3s (rows 4-6), 0s (rows 7-11) with vertical shifts at columns 10-12—generated mismatches by not filling full blocks and leaking noise (e.g., 1s in expected 7/3 areas).
 * Train 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/3s with heavy noise (e.g., row 1 has 7s then 8s/1s; row 6 has 1s/9s/5s); expected: Top 3 rows full 6s ending in 7s, then 3/8/6/7 blocks with a bottom 3/8/9/7 pattern—generated fails to group into large blocks, keeps 1s/6s as noise instead of smoothing to dominants like 6/7/8/9.
 * Train 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/4s/8s with 1s scattered (e.g., row 1 has 1s in middle; row 7 has 1s/7); expected: Top 3 rows 5s then 3s, middle 7/8/6/3 blocks, bottom 7/8/6/4—generated doesn't detect vertical/horizontal subdivisions properly, resulting in partial fills and noise retention (unknown why 5s appear where 3s expected, possibly from miscomputed modes).
 * Train 4 generated: Irregular 2s/6s/3s with 1s (e.g., row 0 has 2s/6s/1; row 7 has 3s/1s); expected: Top 3 and bottom 3 rows full 6s/2s, middle 7 rows 3s/2s—generated fails to smooth vertical columns into blocks, keeps noise like 1s in 6/3 areas.
 * The stripe-finding and subdivision functions are sketched but unused in the main program, so they don't impact outputs; anomaly detection is helpful for refinement but overkill if not integrated into filling.
 * Transposing is broken and unhelpful— it changes the grid orientation without denoising, worsening matches (don't use in future).
 * No attempts passed, showing incomplete integration of denoising logic; core issue is lack of a full reconstruction step to create a new grid by filling detected blocks with their modes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it remains highly noisy and irregular, with scattered 0s/1s/2s/3s/6s/8s/9s across rows (e.g., row 0 has 14 9s then 14 6s; row 12 has mixed 9s/3s/0s/1s/6s; row 24 has 9s/7s/1s), forming no clear large blocks, whereas a correct output should have smooth, rectangular regions of uniform numbers (e.g., large 9/3/6/2/8/4/7 blocks based on apparent patterns in the input).
 * It appears to be a slightly modified version of the input (possibly transposed or partially processed), but noise persists heavily (e.g., isolated 1s in row 13, 0s in row 14), and structures like potential vertical 9-stripe on left or 6-stripe in middle aren't fully filled or subdivided horizontally.
 * Bottom rows show some blockiness (e.g., row 25 has 9/7s/1s/4s/9s/8s), but it's inconsistent and doesn't align with expected denoising—likely failed because the program doesn't apply stripe/subdivision logic to build a new clean grid.
 * Overall, it makes no sense as a solution; it looks like raw input with minor artifacts rather than a reconstructed puzzle, missing the block-filling to handle test's complex noise (e.g., diagonal-ish 0/1 lines and small 2/8 intrusions that should be smoothed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that appears to involve simplifying a noisy or detailed grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty and 1 as holes) into a cleaner, blocky representation of larger rectangular regions dominated by a single color per block, likely by identifying and expanding dominant color modes while ignoring or filling insignificant elements like isolated cells or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent images with colors (integers 2+), 0s as empty space to ignore in mode calculations, and 1s as "holes" that need filling with nearby colors, but filling must preserve overall block structures rather than blending everything.
 * Dominant colors in columns or rows should form "stripes" or sub-blocks, but the process must handle irregular shapes: vertical/horizontal grouping should be based on modes of non-0 cells, yet avoid over-generalizing across breaks in patterns (e.g., don't merge columns with the same mode if interrupted by different dominant regions).
 * Transposition (rotating the grid) is applied at the end, suggesting the simplification might need to work in a specific orientation (e.g., vertical stripes first, then horizontal subdivision), but this can distort results if the initial direction is wrong—subtleties include checking if horizontal stripes or no transpose would better match expected blocky outputs.
 * 0s in expected outputs indicate preserved empty space, so the simplification should not fill everything; blocks should only expand to cover areas where a color truly dominates, leaving gaps as 0.
 * Subtle elements: Modes must ignore 0s but not overcount minorities; BFS for hole-filling works for proximity but fails if it propagates wrong colors across boundaries (e.g., in training 1, it seems to flood 6s and 7s incorrectly into areas that should be 3s or 0s). Patterns often have asymmetric blocks (e.g., L-shapes or offsets), so rigid rectangular subdivision misses curves or steps. Expected outputs show crisp, uniform blocks without noise, implying a need to detect and uniformize regions beyond simple modes—consider connected components or flood-fill for true blobs rather than column/row modes.
 * Across attempts, no handling for multi-color transitions within stripes (e.g., training 2 has mixed 3,6,8 but generated merges wrongly); also, widths/heights of blocks must match exactly (e.g., training 3 generated irregular 4s and 6s where expected has clean horizontal bands).
 * General: Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; test input is larger (28x30?), with complex nested patterns including 0s as separators.

(Transposition is helpful for reorienting if the puzzle requires processing in rows vs. columns, but in this attempt it's applied too late or wrongly, leading to mismatches; consider applying earlier or conditionally.)

(Note: No explicit object extraction function was in this attempt, but one could be added for blob detection via flood-fill to identify connected components of same color, which might better capture non-rectangular blocks before rectangular approximation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples by producing over-smoothed or misaligned blocky grids: e.g., in Train 1, generated uniform horizontal bands of 6/7/4/9 (ignoring expected vertical shifts to 3s and bottom 0s), likely due to vertical stripe grouping propagating modes across row changes incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated merged 7s and 3s into incorrect positions (e.g., top 7s where expected has 6s, and scattered 5s at bottom), missing the expected stepped pattern with 8/6/9 transitions—subdivision didn't capture horizontal offsets.
 * Train 3: Generated repetitive 6/3/4/8 patterns with irregularities (e.g., isolated 5/9 intrusions), while expected has clean horizontal stripes (5/3 then 7/8/6/4 bands); mode computation in sub-blocks failed to uniformize vertical variations.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical stacks of 2/6/4/3 but with inconsistent widths (e.g., 2s not spanning full expected height), missing the expected alternating 6/3/2 bands—stripe finding didn't handle row-mode changes properly within columns.
 * Overall, what worked: Hole-filling via BFS correctly propagates colors locally (no unfilled 1s in outputs), and mode computation ignores 0s appropriately; vertical stripe detection groups similar columns somewhat (e.g., right-side consistencies in Train 1).
 * What didn't work: Build_blocky_grid overfills rectangles without respecting pattern breaks (e.g., creates solid blocks where expected has 0 gaps or color shifts); transpose at end rotates results wrongly, e.g., Train 1 expected is vertical bands but generated looks horizontal post-transpose. Subdivision is too rigid, missing subtle mode changes. No handling for 0 preservation in output. Function find_vertical_stripes is somewhat helpful but broken for non-uniform heights; subdivide_stripe_vertically is unhelpful as it recomputes modes per row-segment without considering full-block connectivity (leads to fragmentation). No object extraction, which might be needed for true block identification—consider adding flood-fill for blobs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a highly uniform, overfilled grid dominated by 9s, 3s, 6s, and 2s in large rectangular bands (e.g., top-heavy 9s, vertical 3/6 stripes, scattered 8s/4s/7s at bottom), but ignores the input's complex structure with 0-separated regions, offsets, and mixed colors (e.g., input has clustered 2s, isolated 0s as dividers, and diagonal-ish transitions around rows 7-22). This results in loss of detail like the input's bottom-right 8s block and mid-grid 2s cluster, replaced by smoothed modes; expected should likely preserve more stepped/offset blocks (e.g., expanding 9s only where dominant, leaving 0 gaps, and uniformizing 2s/6s without bleeding). It doesn't make sense as a simplification because it merges unrelated areas (e.g., top 9s flood into mid-3s), suggesting the vertical-first approach and hole-filling propagate too aggressively without boundary detection.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not grid:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return h, w
```
Basic grid dimensions utility, useful for bounds checking.

```python
def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Dict], List[Dict]]:
    # (Full implementation as in the program: BFS to find non-blue components and separately blue components)
    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:22:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integer cells (0-9 representing colors or shapes) to simulate object recognition and merging rules, such as filling internal holes with priority-based propagation, identifying connected components of the same color, merging or removing components based on adjacency, position, and color-specific rules (e.g., attaching small shapes to larger ones), and finally reconstructing and transposing the grid to match an expected layout that represents assembled or corrected puzzle pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts with 1s as "holes" to be filled via a priority queue-based flood fill from non-1 cells, where priorities (e.g., {0:0, 2:2, 3:10, 4:3, 5:6, 6:5, 7:8, 8:7, 9:9}) determine which color propagates farthest or ties are broken, favoring higher-priority colors for holes.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (non-zero), tracked with bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and size; 0s are background/empty.
 * Merging rules are color- and position-specific: e.g., attach 4 (orange?) directly below 6 (purple?) by expanding bbox and adding size; merge 3 (green) into adjacent 2 (red) if bboxes overlap or touch horizontally/vertically/diagonally (via custom adjacent_or_overlap check); attach 5 (yellow?) to 9 (pink?) if within 1-2 rows above and ccols overlap; remove isolated 4s near 9s; merge 6 and 8 (gray?) into adjacent 7 (blue) by expanding bbox; merge all 3s (greens) into a single component with union bbox; absorb small (<=4 size) non-blue/non-green/non-7/8/9 components into the largest adjacent one.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve or expand bboxes accurately for final filling; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust 4-to-6 before removing 4s near 9s); adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row+1 or col+1); final grid is filled by largest components first (size-descending) within their bboxes, overwriting smaller ones; always transpose at end (rows become cols); 0s remain unfilled unless propagated to; small components might be noise to absorb; blues (7) seem central/absorbing; greens (3) are special-cased to merge globally.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have varying sizes; components might not touch but be positionally related (e.g., vertical stacking); priorities ensure e.g., 3 (high pri 10) fills aggressively over lower ones like 4 (pri 3); disconnected same-color parts stay separate unless explicitly merged; no diagonal connectivity in components; background 0s don't propagate.
 * All training examples failed, suggesting over-merging (e.g., everything to 7s), incorrect adjacency (e.g., missing vertical merges), wrong filling priorities, or bbox expansion errors leading to uniform grids; transposition might be applied correctly but on wrong base grid.

(The various adjust/merge functions like adjust_four_to_six, adjust_three_to_two, etc., are helpful scaffolds for rule-specific logic but are incomplete/buggy in execution order or conditions, leading to over-merging; e.g., adjust_five_to_nine checks r1 > r4 and r1 <= r4+2 for vertical proximity. create_filled_grid is useful for reconstructing but overwrites via size-order, which may cause loss of details. transpose is correct and essential.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect merging and filling, resulting in over-simplification (e.g., uniform colors) or misplaced components.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly 7s with small 3-block in center-left and 9-block bottom-left; expected vertical 3s on right (rows 0-3,11-12?), horizontal 3s bottom (rows 4-6), and 0s in bottom-left (rows 7-11); difference: failed to propagate/absorb correctly, greens not merged/positioned right, no 0s preserved, unknown why 7s dominated (perhaps priority 8 too high or wrong bbox expansion).
 * Train 2: Generated horizontal 3s (rows 2-4,8-9) and mixed 9s/7s bottom-right; expected 6s top/mid-left, 3s left, 8s mid, 9s bottom-right with 7s right; difference: no 6/8 creation, 3s not confined left, 9s over-expanded, 7s misplaced (e.g., single 7s inside); suggests merge_six_into_seven and merge_eight_into_seven not triggering or wrong adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated 3-block left-mid, 7s mid, 9s top-right, isolated 5/4 right; expected 5s top-left, 3s mid-right, 7/8/6 mid, 4s bottom-right; difference: 5 not merged to anything, 4 not removed/attached, 6/8 not formed/merged to 7, 3s wrong position; unknown why 9s propagated up, but bbox overlap likely failed for vertical stacks.
 * Train 4: Generated entire grid as 2s (total overwrite); expected 6s top/bottom, 3s mid-left, 2s right; difference: everything absorbed into 2s via absorb_small_non_blues or wrong filling, no distinction of 6/3; highlights over-aggressive absorption (threshold=4 too low?) or missing specific merges for 6/3.
 * fill_holes works partially (fills 1s) but priorities cause wrong color dominance (e.g., 7 over everything).
 * find_connected_components is solid for extraction but assumes post-fill grid.
 * Merging functions (e.g., adjust_three_to_two) are helpful but buggy: e.g., global merge_all_greens too broad, causing loss in Train 1; remove_four_near_nine deletes too much/little.
 * bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap misses gap-tolerant rules (e.g., for 5-to-9).
 * create_filled_grid overwrites small details due to size-sorting.
 * No functions for input parsing or validation; unhelpful as is.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of components/merging but fail on rule precision, order, and propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive 9-blocks dominating top/mid (rows 0-14,19-24? with minor 8s in row5-7 col8 and row15-24 col22-29), a vertical 6-strip mid-right (cols14-26 rows0-14), and small 7-block bottom-left (rows25-27 cols1-4); this seems like over-propagation of 9s (high pri 9) filling most space, with 6s/8s/7s as remnants, but lacks diversity/variety expected in puzzles (e.g., no 3s/greens merged, possible 0s missing, 8s not fully merged to 7). It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no balanced 6/7/3/2 like Train 4/2), suggesting same issues: wrong priorities causing 9-flood, incomplete merges (e.g., 7s small/not absorbing), and bbox filling overwriting subtly; mentally, if test input has scattered shapes, output should have merged clusters (e.g., greens global, smalls to blues) with preserved empties, not 9-monolith—likely incorrect due to unhandled vertical/horizontal specifics or absorption threshold.

[2025-10-03 16:22:21] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color transformation, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, position, and specific color interactions, then fill and transpose the resulting grid to match an expected output pattern. The rules seem to simulate "object" simplification or unification in a 2D spatial puzzle, possibly inspired by image segmentation or blob analysis, but with custom color-specific behaviors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and must be of the exact same color; bounding boxes (bbox) are used to approximate regions for adjacency checks, but this can lead to over-merging if not precise (e.g., diagonal or distant touches aren't handled).
 * Small components (size <=4) of blue (1) are absorbed into adjacent non-blues, prioritizing the largest; similarly for small non-blues (size 1-4, excluding colors 3,8,9) into larger ones, but this ignores color compatibility and can swallow unintended areas.
 * Color adjustments: 4 becomes 6 if directly below a 6 (row-adjacent, column-overlap); 3 becomes 2 if adjacent or overlapping with 2; 5 becomes 9 if "near" (within 2 rows, column-overlap) a 9—these are asymmetric and position-dependent, easy to miss row/column specifics or overlap definitions.
 * Merging: Similar colors (6 and 7) merge if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller; all greens (3) are unconditionally merged into one giant component regardless of position— this can distort spatial relationships.
 * Expansion: Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, increasing size accordingly, but only vertically and without checking overlaps.
 * Filling: Components are filled into a grid by bbox (not exact shape), sorted by size (greens prioritized), skipping color 0; final transpose flips rows/columns, which is crucial but can confuse orientation.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touch (horizontal/vertical, but not diagonal); bbox merging can create rectangular approximations that overfill; no handling for isolated singles or color 0 as background; order of operations matters (e.g., absorb before merge); greens (3) seem special (merged all, prioritized in filling); no diagonal connectivity; potential for infinite loops in while loops if not careful; transposition is always applied, so inputs/outputs have swapped dimensions.
 * Overlooked: Rules may not apply universally—e.g., in training 1, greens should form a large block but code places a small 3; in training 2, 6s and 7s don't merge properly, and 8s/9s shift; color 0 appears as empty in expected but not handled; small components might not always absorb (e.g., if no adjacent large); position matters more than size sometimes (e.g., "below" or "near").
 * General: Puzzle likely tests understanding of spatial rules over strict connectivity; expected outputs show more irregular shapes (non-rectangular fills), suggesting bbox filling is too crude—need exact pixel filling or shape preservation.

    # Fills grid with color by bbox, sorted by size (greens boosted); skips 0
    # Helpful for output generation but overfills non-rect shapes; priority favors large/greens
    # Transpose after to match expected orientation
```
* `find_adjacent_components`: Uses bbox overlap+1 for "adjacent"; helpful but loose (includes distant if bbox large).
* `is_below` and `is_near`: Position-specific checks; useful for rule application but hardcoded distances (1 row for below, 2 for near) may not generalize.
* Unhelpful/broken functions: `absorb_small_blues` and `absorb_small_non_blues`—they modify in place and filter out absorbed, but don't update colors/sizes accurately and ignore puzzle-specific absorptions (e.g., don't turn absorbed into absorber's color); lead to lost components. `handle_color_adjustments`—while loop with deepcopy is inefficient and deletes during iteration, risking index errors; transformations are too narrow (e.g., misses 6->something). `merge_similar_colors`—only for 6/7, asymmetric absorption; doesn't handle all cases like training 2's 6/7 split. `merge_all_greens`—unconditional global merge ignores spatial separation, causing over-unification (e.g., disconnected greens in expected). `expand_maroon_components`—vertical-only expansion adds phantom size without filling logic; doesn't check boundaries properly. Overall, these are puzzle-specific guesses that don't align with expected outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single comprehensive attempt with multiple rule functions chained in `program`; it demonstrates understanding of connected components and bbox-based processing but fails all training due to incorrect rule assumptions.
 * Training 1: Generated large 7 blocks on left/top with misplaced small 3, bottom 4/9 blocks shifted right; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s in middle/bottom, 0s as background—code over-absorbed blues/non-blues into 7s, didn't merge greens properly into large block, expanded 8s wrongly, and 4/9 didn't transform correctly; transposition may have oriented wrong.
 * Training 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 8/9 on right; expected has 6s merging across, 8s in middle, 9s bottom-right, 7s top-right—code merged all 3s too aggressively, didn't convert/merge 6/7/8 properly, absorbed smalls into 3s instead of transforming, resulting in no 6/8/9 positions.
 * Training 3: Generated horizontal 6s top, 3/4/8 blocks middle with trailing 4s; expected has 5s top-left, vertical 3s, mixed 7/8/6/4 on sides—code didn't handle 5->9 nearness, kept 4s separate instead of below->6, expanded 8s horizontally wrongly, no 5/7 placement, greens not merged right.
 * Training 4: Generated vertical 2s left, full 6s middle, bottom 2s; expected has horizontal 6s top/bottom, vertical 3s middle, 2s right—code absorbed 2/3 into 6s wrongly, didn't preserve 3s as separate vertical, merged 2s prematurely, no 3 block formation.
 * Common issues: Bbox filling creates rectangles over irregular shapes (e.g., expected has non-full bboxes); absorption/merging too aggressive/generic, ignoring color pairs (e.g., 3+2->2, but code merges greens all); position rules (below/near) under-applied; transposition applied but inputs may need row/col swap consideration; no handling for 0 as explicit empty; size thresholds (4) arbitrary and miss cases; order (absorb -> adjust -> merge) causes cascade errors.
 * `find_connected_components` is essential and correct for extraction; others like `merge_all_greens` are overkill/unhelpful as they ignore adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a large 30-column grid (likely transposed from ~20x30 input) with massive 9 blocks on left/bottom, vertical 2s/6s in middle, small 8s bottom-right, and irregular 7/4 in bottom— but patterns are overly rectangular and uniform, suggesting bbox overfill without shape respect.
 * Issues: Huge 9s dominate left (rows 0-30 cols 0-1, scattered elsewhere), but expected likely has more mixed/spatial merges (e.g., 2s absorbed into 9s?); 6s form tall vertical strip (cols 14-26), but training patterns suggest horizontal/oriented merges; 8s are small clustered bottom-right, but expansion rule may overgrow them; 4s appear as block in bottom-middle without transformation (e.g., to 6 if below); 7s small top-bottom left; overall, lacks subtlety like near-merges or color shifts seen in training expecteds (e.g., no visible 3/5 handling, potential 0 empties missing).
 * Doesn't match expected logic: Based on training, test should show merged greens (3) if present, positioned transformations (e.g., 4 below 6), and non-rect fills; instead, it's blob-like with wrong colors (e.g., persistent 2s/4s not absorbed/transformed); transposition may hide input orientation issues. Unknown why 9s are so pervasive—possibly over-absorption of smalls into 9s—but it disrupts balance seen in expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the processing of 2D grids of integers (likely representing colored pixels or regions) to transform noisy or patterned inputs into cleaner, structured outputs that reveal shapes, fill regions, or apply geometric rules like symmetry, connectivity, or boundary detection. The goal is to produce exact matches to expected grids, which seem to emphasize uniform region filling, edge preservation, and possibly object extraction or pattern completion across varying grid sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent visual elements like shapes or blobs of colors (integers 0-9), and transformations must preserve overall structure while cleaning noise, such as isolated pixels or irregular boundaries, without over-smoothing large regions.
 * Expected outputs often show sharp, rectangular or stepped region boundaries (e.g., solid blocks of the same number), suggesting rules for flood-filling connected components or propagating colors based on majority in neighborhoods, but with constraints on directionality or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements include handling non-square grids (e.g., training example 2 is 10x10 but output varies in pattern density), maintaining aspect ratios after any rotation/transposition, and avoiding propagation across disconnected regions—e.g., in training 1, expected has distinct horizontal bands of 7,3,0 without vertical bleed.
 * Connectivity is 4-way (up/down/left/right) rather than 8-way, as diagonal fills are not evident in expectations; noise like single pixels (e.g., potential 1s or 2s in inputs) should be absorbed into dominant neighbors but not spread indefinitely.
 * Patterns may involve symmetry or mirroring (e.g., training 4 expected has repeating rows), and color propagation seems biased toward lower rows/columns in some cases, possibly indicating gravity-like settling or top-down filling.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must exactly match row-by-row, including trailing same-color extensions (e.g., training 1 ends with consistent 7s); over-smoothing can merge unrelated regions (seen in generated outputs with excessive 6/7/8 blending).
 * Across attempts, consider irregular shapes like Ls, Ts, or irregular blobs—rules likely involve bounding boxes or contour following to straighten edges.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x16 in training 1, 10x10 in 2 and 4, 9x14 in 3), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; inputs may have noise levels that require iterative but limited passes to avoid total homogenization.
 * Potential rules: Identify "objects" as connected components of the same color, then expand/contract them to fit expected clean shapes; or apply morphological operations like dilation/erosion before filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used transposition followed by iterative majority-vote smoothing (3x3 neighborhood), which partially denoises small noise but fails to produce structured region fills, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * What worked: Smoothing correctly absorbs some isolated noise (e.g., in training 1, it consolidated lower regions into 4s and 7s, reducing scattered values), and transposition handles orientation swaps, which might be relevant if puzzles involve rotation.
 * What didn't work: Over-smoothing merged distinct regions (e.g., in training 1, generated has gradual gradients of 6->7->8->4 instead of sharp 7/3/0 bands; expected has clear horizontal separation not achieved). In training 2, it failed to isolate small features like 1s or create the expected stepped pattern with 6/8/9. Training 3 generated irregular fills (e.g., partial 3/4/8 blobs) missing the expected clean rows and columns. Training 4 preserved some repetition but incorrectly propagated 2/3/6 without matching the alternating row structure.
 * Transposition alone is unhelpful or broken for these cases, as inputs/outputs don't show consistent row-column swaps (e.g., training 1 expected keeps horizontal bands post-any transform).
 * Majority smoothing function is somewhat helpful for noise reduction but not for the puzzle, as it lacks color-specific rules or connectivity—leads to diffusion rather than precise filling (e.g., in training 1, 6s dominate top where 7s expected).
 * No object extraction was used, missing key for identifying and cleaning blobs; generated outputs show blended colors (e.g., 6/7/8 in training 1) instead of expected pure zones.
 * Iterative smoothing (3 passes) exacerbated blending without boundaries, causing mismatches like training 2's generated 7/8/3/1/5 mess vs. expected clean 6/3/8/9 blocks.
 * extract_objects-like function absent, so no handling of multiple components; this is essential for puzzles with separate regions (e.g., training 3's multiple 3/4/6/8 groups).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a highly irregular, noisy grid with scattered 0/2/3/6/7/8/9 values forming no clear shapes or uniform regions, suggesting over-smoothed chaos rather than structured output (e.g., rows 14-15 have mixed 2/6/9, while earlier rows blend 0/3/6/9 without boundaries).
 * It differs from what we'd expect based on training patterns: likely clean, blocky regions (e.g., large 9 areas with inset 3/6/0/2 shapes, similar to training 1's bands), but generated has jagged edges and unexplained intrusions (e.g., isolated 7s in row 25, 4s in rows 26-29) that don't form expected symmetries or fills—possibly the smoothing propagated noise incorrectly without connectivity rules.
 * No clear propagation or filling observed (e.g., bottom-right 4/8 block looks partial and unmatched to training's uniform ends); this indicates the approach fails on larger, more complex grids with multiple interacting regions.
 * To handle test case, need rules for hierarchical filling (e.g., largest components first) or boundary detection to prevent bleed, as current output homogenizes too much without preserving subtle separations seen in training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual denoising puzzle where the input grid contains numbers representing colors or patterns, with 0 and 1 acting as noise or background/foreground artifacts, and the goal is to reconstruct a cleaner, blocky version by identifying large uniform rectangular regions (stripes or blocks) and filling them with the dominant (mode) value while ignoring noise. The output should consist of large, consistent horizontal and vertical blocks of the same number, smoothing out irregularities to reveal an underlying structured pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have noise (0 and 1) that should be ignored when computing modes or dominant values in rows, columns, or segments; never treat 0 or 1 as valid pattern values unless they form a dominant block themselves (which is rare).
 * Identify vertical stripes first by scanning columns and grouping consecutive columns with the same mode (ignoring noise), then subdivide those stripes horizontally into sub-blocks with uniform row modes.
 * Sub-blocks should be rectangular and as large as possible; small anomalies (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s, or minority values) should be overridden by the surrounding dominant value, but consistent minority patterns might indicate separate sub-blocks.
 * Horizontal symmetry or repetition in expected outputs suggests checking for repeated rows or patterns across the grid; vertical stripes may not span the full height, so subdivide vertically within each stripe.
 * Anomalies should be detected but not propagated—use them only to refine boundaries, not to fill the output; top anomalies (e.g., via Counter) can help identify if a block needs splitting but aren't directly used for filling.
 * Transposing the grid (as in the current program) scrambles the structure and doesn't align with blocky expected outputs, which preserve row/column orientations.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-column or single-row grids should mode the entire thing ignoring noise; blocks may abut without separators, and noise can form thin lines or spots that must be smoothed over.
 * Subtle elements: Dominant value in a segment is the most common non-0/1 number; if no non-noise values, default to 0; outputs are always the same dimensions as input; patterns may shift midway (e.g., a vertical stripe changing mode partway down), requiring vertical subdivision.
 * Across attempts, noise often leaks into outputs (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s remain), and blocks aren't fully filled—e.g., in Train 1, generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s with noise, but expected has clean 7/3/0 blocks; ensure filling propagates the mode across the entire detected block.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed because the main program only transposes the grid (via zip(*g)), which rotates it 90 degrees and preserves noise without any denoising or block-filling, leading to scrambled, noisy outputs that don't match the clean, blocky expected grids.
 * Train 1 generated: Mostly 6s/7s/8s with scattered 1s/0s and irregular shapes (e.g., row 0 has ten 6s then 7s/8s; row 3 has a 3 in noise); expected: Clean horizontal blocks of 7s (rows 0-3), 3s (rows 4-6), 0s (rows 7-11) with vertical shifts at columns 10-12—generated mismatches by not filling full blocks and leaking noise (e.g., 1s in expected 7/3 areas).
 * Train 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/3s with heavy noise (e.g., row 1 has 7s then 8s/1s; row 6 has 1s/9s/5s); expected: Top 3 rows full 6s ending in 7s, then 3/8/6/7 blocks with a bottom 3/8/9/7 pattern—generated fails to group into large blocks, keeps 1s/6s as noise instead of smoothing to dominants like 6/7/8/9.
 * Train 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/4s/8s with 1s scattered (e.g., row 1 has 1s in middle; row 7 has 1s/7); expected: Top 3 rows 5s then 3s, middle 7/8/6/3 blocks, bottom 7/8/6/4—generated doesn't detect vertical/horizontal subdivisions properly, resulting in partial fills and noise retention (unknown why 5s appear where 3s expected, possibly from miscomputed modes).
 * Train 4 generated: Irregular 2s/6s/3s with 1s (e.g., row 0 has 2s/6s/1; row 7 has 3s/1s); expected: Top 3 and bottom 3 rows full 6s/2s, middle 7 rows 3s/2s—generated fails to smooth vertical columns into blocks, keeps noise like 1s in 6/3 areas.
 * The stripe-finding and subdivision functions are sketched but unused in the main program, so they don't impact outputs; anomaly detection is helpful for refinement but overkill if not integrated into filling.
 * Transposing is broken and unhelpful— it changes the grid orientation without denoising, worsening matches (don't use in future).
 * No attempts passed, showing incomplete integration of denoising logic; core issue is lack of a full reconstruction step to create a new grid by filling detected blocks with their modes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it remains highly noisy and irregular, with scattered 0s/1s/2s/3s/6s/8s/9s across rows (e.g., row 0 has 14 9s then 14 6s; row 12 has mixed 9s/3s/0s/1s/6s; row 24 has 9s/7s/1s), forming no clear large blocks, whereas a correct output should have smooth, rectangular regions of uniform numbers (e.g., large 9/3/6/2/8/4/7 blocks based on apparent patterns in the input).
 * It appears to be a slightly modified version of the input (possibly transposed or partially processed), but noise persists heavily (e.g., isolated 1s in row 13, 0s in row 14), and structures like potential vertical 9-stripe on left or 6-stripe in middle aren't fully filled or subdivided horizontally.
 * Bottom rows show some blockiness (e.g., row 25 has 9/7s/1s/4s/9s/8s), but it's inconsistent and doesn't align with expected denoising—likely failed because the program doesn't apply stripe/subdivision logic to build a new clean grid.
 * Overall, it makes no sense as a solution; it looks like raw input with minor artifacts rather than a reconstructed puzzle, missing the block-filling to handle test's complex noise (e.g., diagonal-ish 0/1 lines and small 2/8 intrusions that should be smoothed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that appears to involve simplifying a noisy or detailed grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty and 1 as holes) into a cleaner, blocky representation of larger rectangular regions dominated by a single color per block, likely by identifying and expanding dominant color modes while ignoring or filling insignificant elements like isolated cells or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent images with colors (integers 2+), 0s as empty space to ignore in mode calculations, and 1s as "holes" that need filling with nearby colors, but filling must preserve overall block structures rather than blending everything.
 * Dominant colors in columns or rows should form "stripes" or sub-blocks, but the process must handle irregular shapes: vertical/horizontal grouping should be based on modes of non-0 cells, yet avoid over-generalizing across breaks in patterns (e.g., don't merge columns with the same mode if interrupted by different dominant regions).
 * Transposition (rotating the grid) is applied at the end, suggesting the simplification might need to work in a specific orientation (e.g., vertical stripes first, then horizontal subdivision), but this can distort results if the initial direction is wrong—subtleties include checking if horizontal stripes or no transpose would better match expected blocky outputs.
 * 0s in expected outputs indicate preserved empty space, so the simplification should not fill everything; blocks should only expand to cover areas where a color truly dominates, leaving gaps as 0.
 * Subtle elements: Modes must ignore 0s but not overcount minorities; BFS for hole-filling works for proximity but fails if it propagates wrong colors across boundaries (e.g., in training 1, it seems to flood 6s and 7s incorrectly into areas that should be 3s or 0s). Patterns often have asymmetric blocks (e.g., L-shapes or offsets), so rigid rectangular subdivision misses curves or steps. Expected outputs show crisp, uniform blocks without noise, implying a need to detect and uniformize regions beyond simple modes—consider connected components or flood-fill for true blobs rather than column/row modes.
 * Across attempts, no handling for multi-color transitions within stripes (e.g., training 2 has mixed 3,6,8 but generated merges wrongly); also, widths/heights of blocks must match exactly (e.g., training 3 generated irregular 4s and 6s where expected has clean horizontal bands).
 * General: Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; test input is larger (28x30?), with complex nested patterns including 0s as separators.

                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny, color))

(This BFS hole-filling is helpful for proximity-based completion but needs refinement to avoid over-propagation across block boundaries; useful as a preprocessing step.)

```python
def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:

    count = Counter(x for x in lst if x != 0)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This mode function is core and helpful for identifying dominant colors in rows/columns/segments, ignoring 0s correctly; should be retained and possibly extended to weighted or thresholded modes.)

    """Transpose the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(Transposition is helpful for reorienting if the puzzle requires processing in rows vs. columns, but in this attempt it's applied too late or wrongly, leading to mismatches; consider applying earlier or conditionally.)

(Note: No explicit object extraction function was in this attempt, but one could be added for blob detection via flood-fill to identify connected components of same color, which might better capture non-rectangular blocks before rectangular approximation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples by producing over-smoothed or misaligned blocky grids: e.g., in Train 1, generated uniform horizontal bands of 6/7/4/9 (ignoring expected vertical shifts to 3s and bottom 0s), likely due to vertical stripe grouping propagating modes across row changes incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated merged 7s and 3s into incorrect positions (e.g., top 7s where expected has 6s, and scattered 5s at bottom), missing the expected stepped pattern with 8/6/9 transitions—subdivision didn't capture horizontal offsets.
 * Train 3: Generated repetitive 6/3/4/8 patterns with irregularities (e.g., isolated 5/9 intrusions), while expected has clean horizontal stripes (5/3 then 7/8/6/4 bands); mode computation in sub-blocks failed to uniformize vertical variations.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical stacks of 2/6/4/3 but with inconsistent widths (e.g., 2s not spanning full expected height), missing the expected alternating 6/3/2 bands—stripe finding didn't handle row-mode changes properly within columns.
 * Overall, what worked: Hole-filling via BFS correctly propagates colors locally (no unfilled 1s in outputs), and mode computation ignores 0s appropriately; vertical stripe detection groups similar columns somewhat (e.g., right-side consistencies in Train 1).
 * What didn't work: Build_blocky_grid overfills rectangles without respecting pattern breaks (e.g., creates solid blocks where expected has 0 gaps or color shifts); transpose at end rotates results wrongly, e.g., Train 1 expected is vertical bands but generated looks horizontal post-transpose. Subdivision is too rigid, missing subtle mode changes. No handling for 0 preservation in output. Function find_vertical_stripes is somewhat helpful but broken for non-uniform heights; subdivide_stripe_vertically is unhelpful as it recomputes modes per row-segment without considering full-block connectivity (leads to fragmentation). No object extraction, which might be needed for true block identification—consider adding flood-fill for blobs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a highly uniform, overfilled grid dominated by 9s, 3s, 6s, and 2s in large rectangular bands (e.g., top-heavy 9s, vertical 3/6 stripes, scattered 8s/4s/7s at bottom), but ignores the input's complex structure with 0-separated regions, offsets, and mixed colors (e.g., input has clustered 2s, isolated 0s as dividers, and diagonal-ish transitions around rows 7-22). This results in loss of detail like the input's bottom-right 8s block and mid-grid 2s cluster, replaced by smoothed modes; expected should likely preserve more stepped/offset blocks (e.g., expanding 9s only where dominant, leaving 0 gaps, and uniformizing 2s/6s without bleeding). It doesn't make sense as a simplification because it merges unrelated areas (e.g., top 9s flood into mid-3s), suggesting the vertical-first approach and hole-filling propagate too aggressively without boundary detection.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integer cells (0-9 representing colors or shapes) to simulate object recognition and merging rules, such as filling internal holes with priority-based propagation, identifying connected components of the same color, merging or removing components based on adjacency, position, and color-specific rules (e.g., attaching small shapes to larger ones), and finally reconstructing and transposing the grid to match an expected layout that represents assembled or corrected puzzle pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts with 1s as "holes" to be filled via a priority queue-based flood fill from non-1 cells, where priorities (e.g., {0:0, 2:2, 3:10, 4:3, 5:6, 6:5, 7:8, 8:7, 9:9}) determine which color propagates farthest or ties are broken, favoring higher-priority colors for holes.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (non-zero), tracked with bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and size; 0s are background/empty.
 * Merging rules are color- and position-specific: e.g., attach 4 (orange?) directly below 6 (purple?) by expanding bbox and adding size; merge 3 (green) into adjacent 2 (red) if bboxes overlap or touch horizontally/vertically/diagonally (via custom adjacent_or_overlap check); attach 5 (yellow?) to 9 (pink?) if within 1-2 rows above and ccols overlap; remove isolated 4s near 9s; merge 6 and 8 (gray?) into adjacent 7 (blue) by expanding bbox; merge all 3s (greens) into a single component with union bbox; absorb small (<=4 size) non-blue/non-green/non-7/8/9 components into the largest adjacent one.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve or expand bboxes accurately for final filling; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust 4-to-6 before removing 4s near 9s); adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row+1 or col+1); final grid is filled by largest components first (size-descending) within their bboxes, overwriting smaller ones; always transpose at end (rows become cols); 0s remain unfilled unless propagated to; small components might be noise to absorb; blues (7) seem central/absorbing; greens (3) are special-cased to merge globally.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have varying sizes; components might not touch but be positionally related (e.g., vertical stacking); priorities ensure e.g., 3 (high pri 10) fills aggressively over lower ones like 4 (pri 3); disconnected same-color parts stay separate unless explicitly merged; no diagonal connectivity in components; background 0s don't propagate.
 * All training examples failed, suggesting over-merging (e.g., everything to 7s), incorrect adjacency (e.g., missing vertical merges), wrong filling priorities, or bbox expansion errors leading to uniform grids; transposition might be applied correctly but on wrong base grid.

(The various adjust/merge functions like adjust_four_to_six, adjust_three_to_two, etc., are helpful scaffolds for rule-specific logic but are incomplete/buggy in execution order or conditions, leading to over-merging; e.g., adjust_five_to_nine checks r1 > r4 and r1 <= r4+2 for vertical proximity. create_filled_grid is useful for reconstructing but overwrites via size-order, which may cause loss of details. transpose is correct and essential.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect merging and filling, resulting in over-simplification (e.g., uniform colors) or misplaced components.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly 7s with small 3-block in center-left and 9-block bottom-left; expected vertical 3s on right (rows 0-3,11-12?), horizontal 3s bottom (rows 4-6), and 0s in bottom-left (rows 7-11); difference: failed to propagate/absorb correctly, greens not merged/positioned right, no 0s preserved, unknown why 7s dominated (perhaps priority 8 too high or wrong bbox expansion).
 * Train 2: Generated horizontal 3s (rows 2-4,8-9) and mixed 9s/7s bottom-right; expected 6s top/mid-left, 3s left, 8s mid, 9s bottom-right with 7s right; difference: no 6/8 creation, 3s not confined left, 9s over-expanded, 7s misplaced (e.g., single 7s inside); suggests merge_six_into_seven and merge_eight_into_seven not triggering or wrong adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated 3-block left-mid, 7s mid, 9s top-right, isolated 5/4 right; expected 5s top-left, 3s mid-right, 7/8/6 mid, 4s bottom-right; difference: 5 not merged to anything, 4 not removed/attached, 6/8 not formed/merged to 7, 3s wrong position; unknown why 9s propagated up, but bbox overlap likely failed for vertical stacks.
 * Train 4: Generated entire grid as 2s (total overwrite); expected 6s top/bottom, 3s mid-left, 2s right; difference: everything absorbed into 2s via absorb_small_non_blues or wrong filling, no distinction of 6/3; highlights over-aggressive absorption (threshold=4 too low?) or missing specific merges for 6/3.
 * fill_holes works partially (fills 1s) but priorities cause wrong color dominance (e.g., 7 over everything).
 * find_connected_components is solid for extraction but assumes post-fill grid.
 * Merging functions (e.g., adjust_three_to_two) are helpful but buggy: e.g., global merge_all_greens too broad, causing loss in Train 1; remove_four_near_nine deletes too much/little.
 * bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap misses gap-tolerant rules (e.g., for 5-to-9).
 * create_filled_grid overwrites small details due to size-sorting.
 * No functions for input parsing or validation; unhelpful as is.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of components/merging but fail on rule precision, order, and propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive 9-blocks dominating top/mid (rows 0-14,19-24? with minor 8s in row5-7 col8 and row15-24 col22-29), a vertical 6-strip mid-right (cols14-26 rows0-14), and small 7-block bottom-left (rows25-27 cols1-4); this seems like over-propagation of 9s (high pri 9) filling most space, with 6s/8s/7s as remnants, but lacks diversity/variety expected in puzzles (e.g., no 3s/greens merged, possible 0s missing, 8s not fully merged to 7). It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no balanced 6/7/3/2 like Train 4/2), suggesting same issues: wrong priorities causing 9-flood, incomplete merges (e.g., 7s small/not absorbing), and bbox filling overwriting subtly; mentally, if test input has scattered shapes, output should have merged clusters (e.g., greens global, smalls to blues) with preserved empties, not 9-monolith—likely incorrect due to unhandled vertical/horizontal specifics or absorption threshold.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:24:10] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image segmentation and region merging, where input grids with colors (including placeholder 1s to be resolved) represent partial or noisy images of shapes or letters, and the goal is to process them into clean, expected outputs by filling ambiguities, identifying connected components, and applying color-specific merge/expansion rules to form coherent regions that match target patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are transposed at the end, so row/column orientations must account for this (e.g., what appears vertical in input may need horizontal processing post-transpose).
 * Placeholder 1s must be iteratively filled based on the most common adjacent non-1 color, propagating changes until stable; this resolves ambiguities but can over-smooth if not handled carefully.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), tracked by bounding boxes (bbox) and size; components of the same color are grouped, but merges happen across specific color pairs or conditions.
 * Specific merge rules: 4-regions adjacent below 6-regions merge into 6 (vertical adjacency check); 5-regions near (dist 1-2 rows below) 9-regions merge into 9; 3 (green) regions adjacent or overlapping with 2 merge into 2; 6 and 7 are complements (13 - color) and merge if adjacent/overlapping, preferring the larger size; all 3 (green) regions across the grid are union-merged into one large green blob regardless of connectivity.
 * Expansion rules: 8 (maroon) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, recalculating size as full bbox area (assumes solid fill); small components (<=4 cells, excluding 3/8/9) absorb into the largest adjacent component if overlapping/adjacent.
 * 9-regions absorb into adjacent 8 if smaller; final grid is filled by largest-to-smallest components to avoid overlaps, but this can overwrite if bboxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row/col +1 checks); merges modify in-place with deepcopy to avoid mutation issues, but loops must handle index shifts (e.g., del i requires i adjustment); greens (3) are special-cased for global union, ignoring connectivity; small absorptions prioritize largest neighbor; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust merges before absorb small); unmerged components retain original color but may be overwritten in final fill; 0s remain empty/background.
 * Easy-to-miss: Bbox calculations must update min/max correctly during merges; size is pixel count, not bbox area (except post-expansion for 8); counter for filling 1s uses most_common, breaking ties arbitrarily; no diagonal connectivity; potential over-merging if adjacency is too loose; transpose flips the grid, so expected outputs are post-transpose views.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * adjust_four_to_six: Too restrictive (only exact row+1 below, col overlap); misses diagonal or partial adjacencies, leading to unmerged 4s in train 3.
 * adjust_five_to_nine: Distance check (1-2 rows) is arbitrary and fails if not vertically aligned perfectly; doesn't handle horizontal offsets well.
 * adjust_three_to_two: Relies on is_adjacent_or_overlap, but in train 1, it didn't trigger enough, leaving scattered 3s.
 * merge_six_and_seven: Loop breaks on first change but uses while changed outer loop; buggy index handling (i -=1 only in one branch) causes skipped merges or infinite loops in complex cases.
 * merge_all_greens: Unions all 3s globally, which over-merges disconnected greens (e.g., train 1 expected separate 3s in top/right, but this creates one blob covering unrelated areas).
 * expand_maroon: Assumes solid rectangular fill for size post-expansion, but if 8 has holes/gaps, size overestimates; vertical-only expansion misses horizontal needs in some cases.
 * absorb_small_components: Good intent, but excludes 3/8/9 arbitrarily (why not absorb small 9s elsewhere?); sorts by size but always picks largest, ignoring color compatibility.
 * absorb_nine_to_maroon: Only if 9 smaller than 8 and adjacent; but in train 2, 9s weren't absorbed properly, leaving them separate.
 * Overall program: Order of calls (e.g., merge greens after 6/7) can conflict; no handling for color 0s or backgrounds; final fill assumes rectangular bboxes are solid, but components may not be.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of merge triggers and order.
 * Train 1: Generated scattered 7s/8s with misplaced 3/4/9; expected large vertical 3s on right/top and 7s, with 0s bottom-left. What worked: Filled 1s and found some components (e.g., large 7/8 blocks). What didn't: Failed to merge all 3s into disconnected vertical strips (global union overdid it); 4s not merged to 6 (no 6 present?); small 3 absorbed wrong; transpose may have flipped placements incorrectly. Mismatch: Generated has horizontal 3 in row 3, but expected vertical 3s; unknown why 4/9 block bottom-middle instead of 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 9s bottom-right; expected mixed 6/7/3/8/9 with specific placements (e.g., 6 left, 8 middle, 9 bottom-right). What worked: Merged some 3s into rows, detected 8/9 adjacency. What didn't: No 6/7 merging (colors not complemented properly); 9s not absorbed into 8 or expanded; 3s over-merged horizontally instead of keeping shape. Mismatch: Generated lacks 6/7 entirely, has uniform 3 rows vs. expected irregular 3/8/6/9.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal 6/3/4/8 with small 5s; expected vertical 5/3/7/8/6/4/9 patterns. What worked: Detected 6/8 blocks, some 3/4 adjacency. What didn't: 5s left as small unabsorbed (should merge?); 4s not adjusted to 6; no 7/9 handling; bbox overlaps caused overwrite to wrong colors. Mismatch: Generated has uniform rows, but expected has vertical stacks (e.g., 5 top-left, 6 middle-right); 5s appear top-right instead of left.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical 2s left/bottom with 6s middle; expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers. What worked: Merged 2s into large block bottom, some 6 detection. What didn't: No 3-to-2 merge (3s absorbed wrong or missing); 6s not expanded or positioned right; transpose flipped to vertical but expected horizontal. Mismatch: Generated 2s dominate left, but expected 2s right/bottom; 3s vanished entirely (over-absorbed?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive uniform 9 blocks top/middle/bottom with thin 6 strip middle-right, small 8 horizontal bottom, and misplaced 7/4 bottom-middle. This seems over-merged (e.g., all top/middle as 9, ignoring shapes), with no 3s/2s/5s visible and irregular 4/7 insertion bottom. Expected likely has more varied regions (e.g., vertical/horizontal bands of 6/8/9/3 like training, with merges forming letters/shapes); current output lacks structure, has unexplained 4-block in bottom-middle (unmerged?), and 8 not expanded properly. Transpose may have distorted vertical elements to horizontal. It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no global green union visible, small components not absorbed cleanly), suggesting misses in color-specific rules for this larger grid.

[2025-10-03 16:24:10] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

                    adjacent_green = any(
                        0 <= i + di < r and 0 <= j + dj < c and g[i + di][j + dj] == 3
                        for di, dj in directions

    # Attempts to fill remaining 1's with adjacent non-1 colors, picking the first one found.
    # Partially helpful for basic filling, but broken as it doesn't consider distance, majority, or prevent cycles/overwrites; leads to arbitrary colors.

                    color = 0  # Default to 0 if no adjacent
                    for di, dj in directions:
                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                        if 0 <= ni < r and 0 <= nj < c and g[ni][nj] != 1:
                            color = g[ni][nj]

                    new_g[i][j] = color
                    if new_g[i][j] != 1:
                        changed = True
        g = new_g
    return g
```

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Simple matrix transpose; helpful for final orientation if the puzzle requires row-column swap.
    # Not broken, but application after expansions mismatches expected block alignments.
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color transformation, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, position, and specific color interactions, then fill and transpose the resulting grid to match an expected output pattern. The rules seem to simulate "object" simplification or unification in a 2D spatial puzzle, possibly inspired by image segmentation or blob analysis, but with custom color-specific behaviors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and must be of the exact same color; bounding boxes (bbox) are used to approximate regions for adjacency checks, but this can lead to over-merging if not precise (e.g., diagonal or distant touches aren't handled).
 * Small components (size <=4) of blue (1) are absorbed into adjacent non-blues, prioritizing the largest; similarly for small non-blues (size 1-4, excluding colors 3,8,9) into larger ones, but this ignores color compatibility and can swallow unintended areas.
 * Color adjustments: 4 becomes 6 if directly below a 6 (row-adjacent, column-overlap); 3 becomes 2 if adjacent or overlapping with 2; 5 becomes 9 if "near" (within 2 rows, column-overlap) a 9—these are asymmetric and position-dependent, easy to miss row/column specifics or overlap definitions.
 * Merging: Similar colors (6 and 7) merge if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller; all greens (3) are unconditionally merged into one giant component regardless of position— this can distort spatial relationships.
 * Expansion: Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, increasing size accordingly, but only vertically and without checking overlaps.
 * Filling: Components are filled into a grid by bbox (not exact shape), sorted by size (greens prioritized), skipping color 0; final transpose flips rows/columns, which is crucial but can confuse orientation.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touch (horizontal/vertical, but not diagonal); bbox merging can create rectangular approximations that overfill; no handling for isolated singles or color 0 as background; order of operations matters (e.g., absorb before merge); greens (3) seem special (merged all, prioritized in filling); no diagonal connectivity; potential for infinite loops in while loops if not careful; transposition is always applied, so inputs/outputs have swapped dimensions.
 * Overlooked: Rules may not apply universally—e.g., in training 1, greens should form a large block but code places a small 3; in training 2, 6s and 7s don't merge properly, and 8s/9s shift; color 0 appears as empty in expected but not handled; small components might not always absorb (e.g., if no adjacent large); position matters more than size sometimes (e.g., "below" or "near").
 * General: Puzzle likely tests understanding of spatial rules over strict connectivity; expected outputs show more irregular shapes (non-rectangular fills), suggesting bbox filling is too crude—need exact pixel filling or shape preservation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

# Dict for components: stores color, bbox as tuple (r1,c1,r2,c2), size
# This is useful for tracking regions without full pixel lists
```

def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Standard flood-fill BFS/DFS to find same-color connected components with bbox and size
    # Helpful for initial segmentation; directions are 4-way, visited prevents reprocessing
    # Returns list of dicts; accurate for exact connectivity but bbox approx for later steps
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                # ... (rest as in code)
    return components
```
```python
def bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # Checks overlap or edge-adjacency (horiz/vert, no diagonal); useful for merge/absorb decisions
    # But can false-positive if bboxes touch without actual cell adjacency
    r1, c1, r2, c2 = b1
    r3, c3, r4, c4 = b2
    if max(r1, r3) <= min(r2, r4) and max(c1, c3) <= min(c2, c4):
        return True
    # ... (rest as in code)
    return False
```
```python
def create_filled_grid(components: List[Dict], h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Fills grid with color by bbox, sorted by size (greens boosted); skips 0
    # Helpful for output generation but overfills non-rect shapes; priority favors large/greens
    # Transpose after to match expected orientation
```
* `find_adjacent_components`: Uses bbox overlap+1 for "adjacent"; helpful but loose (includes distant if bbox large).
* `is_below` and `is_near`: Position-specific checks; useful for rule application but hardcoded distances (1 row for below, 2 for near) may not generalize.
* Unhelpful/broken functions: `absorb_small_blues` and `absorb_small_non_blues`—they modify in place and filter out absorbed, but don't update colors/sizes accurately and ignore puzzle-specific absorptions (e.g., don't turn absorbed into absorber's color); lead to lost components. `handle_color_adjustments`—while loop with deepcopy is inefficient and deletes during iteration, risking index errors; transformations are too narrow (e.g., misses 6->something). `merge_similar_colors`—only for 6/7, asymmetric absorption; doesn't handle all cases like training 2's 6/7 split. `merge_all_greens`—unconditional global merge ignores spatial separation, causing over-unification (e.g., disconnected greens in expected). `expand_maroon_components`—vertical-only expansion adds phantom size without filling logic; doesn't check boundaries properly. Overall, these are puzzle-specific guesses that don't align with expected outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single comprehensive attempt with multiple rule functions chained in `program`; it demonstrates understanding of connected components and bbox-based processing but fails all training due to incorrect rule assumptions.
 * Training 1: Generated large 7 blocks on left/top with misplaced small 3, bottom 4/9 blocks shifted right; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s in middle/bottom, 0s as background—code over-absorbed blues/non-blues into 7s, didn't merge greens properly into large block, expanded 8s wrongly, and 4/9 didn't transform correctly; transposition may have oriented wrong.
 * Training 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 8/9 on right; expected has 6s merging across, 8s in middle, 9s bottom-right, 7s top-right—code merged all 3s too aggressively, didn't convert/merge 6/7/8 properly, absorbed smalls into 3s instead of transforming, resulting in no 6/8/9 positions.
 * Training 3: Generated horizontal 6s top, 3/4/8 blocks middle with trailing 4s; expected has 5s top-left, vertical 3s, mixed 7/8/6/4 on sides—code didn't handle 5->9 nearness, kept 4s separate instead of below->6, expanded 8s horizontally wrongly, no 5/7 placement, greens not merged right.
 * Training 4: Generated vertical 2s left, full 6s middle, bottom 2s; expected has horizontal 6s top/bottom, vertical 3s middle, 2s right—code absorbed 2/3 into 6s wrongly, didn't preserve 3s as separate vertical, merged 2s prematurely, no 3 block formation.
 * Common issues: Bbox filling creates rectangles over irregular shapes (e.g., expected has non-full bboxes); absorption/merging too aggressive/generic, ignoring color pairs (e.g., 3+2->2, but code merges greens all); position rules (below/near) under-applied; transposition applied but inputs may need row/col swap consideration; no handling for 0 as explicit empty; size thresholds (4) arbitrary and miss cases; order (absorb -> adjust -> merge) causes cascade errors.
 * `find_connected_components` is essential and correct for extraction; others like `merge_all_greens` are overkill/unhelpful as they ignore adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a large 30-column grid (likely transposed from ~20x30 input) with massive 9 blocks on left/bottom, vertical 2s/6s in middle, small 8s bottom-right, and irregular 7/4 in bottom— but patterns are overly rectangular and uniform, suggesting bbox overfill without shape respect.
 * Issues: Huge 9s dominate left (rows 0-30 cols 0-1, scattered elsewhere), but expected likely has more mixed/spatial merges (e.g., 2s absorbed into 9s?); 6s form tall vertical strip (cols 14-26), but training patterns suggest horizontal/oriented merges; 8s are small clustered bottom-right, but expansion rule may overgrow them; 4s appear as block in bottom-middle without transformation (e.g., to 6 if below); 7s small top-bottom left; overall, lacks subtlety like near-merges or color shifts seen in training expecteds (e.g., no visible 3/5 handling, potential 0 empties missing).
 * Doesn't match expected logic: Based on training, test should show merged greens (3) if present, positioned transformations (e.g., 4 below 6), and non-rect fills; instead, it's blob-like with wrong colors (e.g., persistent 2s/4s not absorbed/transformed); transposition may hide input orientation issues. Unknown why 9s are so pervasive—possibly over-absorption of smalls into 9s—but it disrupts balance seen in expecteds.

**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the processing of 2D grids of integers (likely representing colored pixels or regions) to transform noisy or patterned inputs into cleaner, structured outputs that reveal shapes, fill regions, or apply geometric rules like symmetry, connectivity, or boundary detection. The goal is to produce exact matches to expected grids, which seem to emphasize uniform region filling, edge preservation, and possibly object extraction or pattern completion across varying grid sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent visual elements like shapes or blobs of colors (integers 0-9), and transformations must preserve overall structure while cleaning noise, such as isolated pixels or irregular boundaries, without over-smoothing large regions.
 * Expected outputs often show sharp, rectangular or stepped region boundaries (e.g., solid blocks of the same number), suggesting rules for flood-filling connected components or propagating colors based on majority in neighborhoods, but with constraints on directionality or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements include handling non-square grids (e.g., training example 2 is 10x10 but output varies in pattern density), maintaining aspect ratios after any rotation/transposition, and avoiding propagation across disconnected regions—e.g., in training 1, expected has distinct horizontal bands of 7,3,0 without vertical bleed.
 * Connectivity is 4-way (up/down/left/right) rather than 8-way, as diagonal fills are not evident in expectations; noise like single pixels (e.g., potential 1s or 2s in inputs) should be absorbed into dominant neighbors but not spread indefinitely.
 * Patterns may involve symmetry or mirroring (e.g., training 4 expected has repeating rows), and color propagation seems biased toward lower rows/columns in some cases, possibly indicating gravity-like settling or top-down filling.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must exactly match row-by-row, including trailing same-color extensions (e.g., training 1 ends with consistent 7s); over-smoothing can merge unrelated regions (seen in generated outputs with excessive 6/7/8 blending).
 * Across attempts, consider irregular shapes like Ls, Ts, or irregular blobs—rules likely involve bounding boxes or contour following to straighten edges.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x16 in training 1, 10x10 in 2 and 4, 9x14 in 3), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; inputs may have noise levels that require iterative but limited passes to avoid total homogenization.
 * Potential rules: Identify "objects" as connected components of the same color, then expand/contract them to fit expected clean shapes; or apply morphological operations like dilation/erosion before filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used transposition followed by iterative majority-vote smoothing (3x3 neighborhood), which partially denoises small noise but fails to produce structured region fills, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * What worked: Smoothing correctly absorbs some isolated noise (e.g., in training 1, it consolidated lower regions into 4s and 7s, reducing scattered values), and transposition handles orientation swaps, which might be relevant if puzzles involve rotation.
 * What didn't work: Over-smoothing merged distinct regions (e.g., in training 1, generated has gradual gradients of 6->7->8->4 instead of sharp 7/3/0 bands; expected has clear horizontal separation not achieved). In training 2, it failed to isolate small features like 1s or create the expected stepped pattern with 6/8/9. Training 3 generated irregular fills (e.g., partial 3/4/8 blobs) missing the expected clean rows and columns. Training 4 preserved some repetition but incorrectly propagated 2/3/6 without matching the alternating row structure.
 * Transposition alone is unhelpful or broken for these cases, as inputs/outputs don't show consistent row-column swaps (e.g., training 1 expected keeps horizontal bands post-any transform).
 * Majority smoothing function is somewhat helpful for noise reduction but not for the puzzle, as it lacks color-specific rules or connectivity—leads to diffusion rather than precise filling (e.g., in training 1, 6s dominate top where 7s expected).
 * No object extraction was used, missing key for identifying and cleaning blobs; generated outputs show blended colors (e.g., 6/7/8 in training 1) instead of expected pure zones.
 * Iterative smoothing (3 passes) exacerbated blending without boundaries, causing mismatches like training 2's generated 7/8/3/1/5 mess vs. expected clean 6/3/8/9 blocks.
 * extract_objects-like function absent, so no handling of multiple components; this is essential for puzzles with separate regions (e.g., training 3's multiple 3/4/6/8 groups).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a highly irregular, noisy grid with scattered 0/2/3/6/7/8/9 values forming no clear shapes or uniform regions, suggesting over-smoothed chaos rather than structured output (e.g., rows 14-15 have mixed 2/6/9, while earlier rows blend 0/3/6/9 without boundaries).
 * It differs from what we'd expect based on training patterns: likely clean, blocky regions (e.g., large 9 areas with inset 3/6/0/2 shapes, similar to training 1's bands), but generated has jagged edges and unexplained intrusions (e.g., isolated 7s in row 25, 4s in rows 26-29) that don't form expected symmetries or fills—possibly the smoothing propagated noise incorrectly without connectivity rules.
 * No clear propagation or filling observed (e.g., bottom-right 4/8 block looks partial and unmatched to training's uniform ends); this indicates the approach fails on larger, more complex grids with multiple interacting regions.
 * To handle test case, need rules for hierarchical filling (e.g., largest components first) or boundary detection to prevent bleed, as current output homogenizes too much without preserving subtle separations seen in training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual denoising puzzle where the input grid contains numbers representing colors or patterns, with 0 and 1 acting as noise or background/foreground artifacts, and the goal is to reconstruct a cleaner, blocky version by identifying large uniform rectangular regions (stripes or blocks) and filling them with the dominant (mode) value while ignoring noise. The output should consist of large, consistent horizontal and vertical blocks of the same number, smoothing out irregularities to reveal an underlying structured pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have noise (0 and 1) that should be ignored when computing modes or dominant values in rows, columns, or segments; never treat 0 or 1 as valid pattern values unless they form a dominant block themselves (which is rare).
 * Identify vertical stripes first by scanning columns and grouping consecutive columns with the same mode (ignoring noise), then subdivide those stripes horizontally into sub-blocks with uniform row modes.
 * Sub-blocks should be rectangular and as large as possible; small anomalies (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s, or minority values) should be overridden by the surrounding dominant value, but consistent minority patterns might indicate separate sub-blocks.
 * Horizontal symmetry or repetition in expected outputs suggests checking for repeated rows or patterns across the grid; vertical stripes may not span the full height, so subdivide vertically within each stripe.
 * Anomalies should be detected but not propagated—use them only to refine boundaries, not to fill the output; top anomalies (e.g., via Counter) can help identify if a block needs splitting but aren't directly used for filling.
 * Transposing the grid (as in the current program) scrambles the structure and doesn't align with blocky expected outputs, which preserve row/column orientations.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-column or single-row grids should mode the entire thing ignoring noise; blocks may abut without separators, and noise can form thin lines or spots that must be smoothed over.
 * Subtle elements: Dominant value in a segment is the most common non-0/1 number; if no non-noise values, default to 0; outputs are always the same dimensions as input; patterns may shift midway (e.g., a vertical stripe changing mode partway down), requiring vertical subdivision.
 * Across attempts, noise often leaks into outputs (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s remain), and blocks aren't fully filled—e.g., in Train 1, generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s with noise, but expected has clean 7/3/0 blocks; ensure filling propagates the mode across the entire detected block.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed because the main program only transposes the grid (via zip(*g)), which rotates it 90 degrees and preserves noise without any denoising or block-filling, leading to scrambled, noisy outputs that don't match the clean, blocky expected grids.
 * Train 1 generated: Mostly 6s/7s/8s with scattered 1s/0s and irregular shapes (e.g., row 0 has ten 6s then 7s/8s; row 3 has a 3 in noise); expected: Clean horizontal blocks of 7s (rows 0-3), 3s (rows 4-6), 0s (rows 7-11) with vertical shifts at columns 10-12—generated mismatches by not filling full blocks and leaking noise (e.g., 1s in expected 7/3 areas).
 * Train 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/3s with heavy noise (e.g., row 1 has 7s then 8s/1s; row 6 has 1s/9s/5s); expected: Top 3 rows full 6s ending in 7s, then 3/8/6/7 blocks with a bottom 3/8/9/7 pattern—generated fails to group into large blocks, keeps 1s/6s as noise instead of smoothing to dominants like 6/7/8/9.
 * Train 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/4s/8s with 1s scattered (e.g., row 1 has 1s in middle; row 7 has 1s/7); expected: Top 3 rows 5s then 3s, middle 7/8/6/3 blocks, bottom 7/8/6/4—generated doesn't detect vertical/horizontal subdivisions properly, resulting in partial fills and noise retention (unknown why 5s appear where 3s expected, possibly from miscomputed modes).
 * Train 4 generated: Irregular 2s/6s/3s with 1s (e.g., row 0 has 2s/6s/1; row 7 has 3s/1s); expected: Top 3 and bottom 3 rows full 6s/2s, middle 7 rows 3s/2s—generated fails to smooth vertical columns into blocks, keeps noise like 1s in 6/3 areas.
 * The stripe-finding and subdivision functions are sketched but unused in the main program, so they don't impact outputs; anomaly detection is helpful for refinement but overkill if not integrated into filling.
 * Transposing is broken and unhelpful— it changes the grid orientation without denoising, worsening matches (don't use in future).
 * No attempts passed, showing incomplete integration of denoising logic; core issue is lack of a full reconstruction step to create a new grid by filling detected blocks with their modes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it remains highly noisy and irregular, with scattered 0s/1s/2s/3s/6s/8s/9s across rows (e.g., row 0 has 14 9s then 14 6s; row 12 has mixed 9s/3s/0s/1s/6s; row 24 has 9s/7s/1s), forming no clear large blocks, whereas a correct output should have smooth, rectangular regions of uniform numbers (e.g., large 9/3/6/2/8/4/7 blocks based on apparent patterns in the input).
 * It appears to be a slightly modified version of the input (possibly transposed or partially processed), but noise persists heavily (e.g., isolated 1s in row 13, 0s in row 14), and structures like potential vertical 9-stripe on left or 6-stripe in middle aren't fully filled or subdivided horizontally.
 * Bottom rows show some blockiness (e.g., row 25 has 9/7s/1s/4s/9s/8s), but it's inconsistent and doesn't align with expected denoising—likely failed because the program doesn't apply stripe/subdivision logic to build a new clean grid.
 * Overall, it makes no sense as a solution; it looks like raw input with minor artifacts rather than a reconstructed puzzle, missing the block-filling to handle test's complex noise (e.g., diagonal-ish 0/1 lines and small 2/8 intrusions that should be smoothed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that appears to involve simplifying a noisy or detailed grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty and 1 as holes) into a cleaner, blocky representation of larger rectangular regions dominated by a single color per block, likely by identifying and expanding dominant color modes while ignoring or filling insignificant elements like isolated cells or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent images with colors (integers 2+), 0s as empty space to ignore in mode calculations, and 1s as "holes" that need filling with nearby colors, but filling must preserve overall block structures rather than blending everything.
 * Dominant colors in columns or rows should form "stripes" or sub-blocks, but the process must handle irregular shapes: vertical/horizontal grouping should be based on modes of non-0 cells, yet avoid over-generalizing across breaks in patterns (e.g., don't merge columns with the same mode if interrupted by different dominant regions).
 * Transposition (rotating the grid) is applied at the end, suggesting the simplification might need to work in a specific orientation (e.g., vertical stripes first, then horizontal subdivision), but this can distort results if the initial direction is wrong—subtleties include checking if horizontal stripes or no transpose would better match expected blocky outputs.
 * 0s in expected outputs indicate preserved empty space, so the simplification should not fill everything; blocks should only expand to cover areas where a color truly dominates, leaving gaps as 0.
 * Subtle elements: Modes must ignore 0s but not overcount minorities; BFS for hole-filling works for proximity but fails if it propagates wrong colors across boundaries (e.g., in training 1, it seems to flood 6s and 7s incorrectly into areas that should be 3s or 0s). Patterns often have asymmetric blocks (e.g., L-shapes or offsets), so rigid rectangular subdivision misses curves or steps. Expected outputs show crisp, uniform blocks without noise, implying a need to detect and uniformize regions beyond simple modes—consider connected components or flood-fill for true blobs rather than column/row modes.
 * Across attempts, no handling for multi-color transitions within stripes (e.g., training 2 has mixed 3,6,8 but generated merges wrongly); also, widths/heights of blocks must match exactly (e.g., training 3 generated irregular 4s and 6s where expected has clean horizontal bands).
 * General: Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; test input is larger (28x30?), with complex nested patterns including 0s as separators.

    """Fill all 1's with the nearest non-1 color using multi-source BFS."""
    if not g or not g[0]:

                visited[i][j] = True
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        x, y, color = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                grid[nx][ny] = color
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny, color))
    return grid
```
(This BFS hole-filling is helpful for proximity-based completion but needs refinement to avoid over-propagation across block boundaries; useful as a preprocessing step.)

```python
def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:
    """Compute mode ignoring 0."""
    count = Counter(x for x in lst if x != 0)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This mode function is core and helpful for identifying dominant colors in rows/columns/segments, ignoring 0s correctly; should be retained and possibly extended to weighted or thresholded modes.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(Transposition is helpful for reorienting if the puzzle requires processing in rows vs. columns, but in this attempt it's applied too late or wrongly, leading to mismatches; consider applying earlier or conditionally.)

(Note: No explicit object extraction function was in this attempt, but one could be added for blob detection via flood-fill to identify connected components of same color, which might better capture non-rectangular blocks before rectangular approximation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples by producing over-smoothed or misaligned blocky grids: e.g., in Train 1, generated uniform horizontal bands of 6/7/4/9 (ignoring expected vertical shifts to 3s and bottom 0s), likely due to vertical stripe grouping propagating modes across row changes incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated merged 7s and 3s into incorrect positions (e.g., top 7s where expected has 6s, and scattered 5s at bottom), missing the expected stepped pattern with 8/6/9 transitions—subdivision didn't capture horizontal offsets.
 * Train 3: Generated repetitive 6/3/4/8 patterns with irregularities (e.g., isolated 5/9 intrusions), while expected has clean horizontal stripes (5/3 then 7/8/6/4 bands); mode computation in sub-blocks failed to uniformize vertical variations.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical stacks of 2/6/4/3 but with inconsistent widths (e.g., 2s not spanning full expected height), missing the expected alternating 6/3/2 bands—stripe finding didn't handle row-mode changes properly within columns.
 * Overall, what worked: Hole-filling via BFS correctly propagates colors locally (no unfilled 1s in outputs), and mode computation ignores 0s appropriately; vertical stripe detection groups similar columns somewhat (e.g., right-side consistencies in Train 1).
 * What didn't work: Build_blocky_grid overfills rectangles without respecting pattern breaks (e.g., creates solid blocks where expected has 0 gaps or color shifts); transpose at end rotates results wrongly, e.g., Train 1 expected is vertical bands but generated looks horizontal post-transpose. Subdivision is too rigid, missing subtle mode changes. No handling for 0 preservation in output. Function find_vertical_stripes is somewhat helpful but broken for non-uniform heights; subdivide_stripe_vertically is unhelpful as it recomputes modes per row-segment without considering full-block connectivity (leads to fragmentation). No object extraction, which might be needed for true block identification—consider adding flood-fill for blobs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a highly uniform, overfilled grid dominated by 9s, 3s, 6s, and 2s in large rectangular bands (e.g., top-heavy 9s, vertical 3/6 stripes, scattered 8s/4s/7s at bottom), but ignores the input's complex structure with 0-separated regions, offsets, and mixed colors (e.g., input has clustered 2s, isolated 0s as dividers, and diagonal-ish transitions around rows 7-22). This results in loss of detail like the input's bottom-right 8s block and mid-grid 2s cluster, replaced by smoothed modes; expected should likely preserve more stepped/offset blocks (e.g., expanding 9s only where dominant, leaving 0 gaps, and uniformizing 2s/6s without bleeding). It doesn't make sense as a simplification because it merges unrelated areas (e.g., top 9s flood into mid-3s), suggesting the vertical-first approach and hole-filling propagate too aggressively without boundary detection.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integer cells (0-9 representing colors or shapes) to simulate object recognition and merging rules, such as filling internal holes with priority-based propagation, identifying connected components of the same color, merging or removing components based on adjacency, position, and color-specific rules (e.g., attaching small shapes to larger ones), and finally reconstructing and transposing the grid to match an expected layout that represents assembled or corrected puzzle pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts with 1s as "holes" to be filled via a priority queue-based flood fill from non-1 cells, where priorities (e.g., {0:0, 2:2, 3:10, 4:3, 5:6, 6:5, 7:8, 8:7, 9:9}) determine which color propagates farthest or ties are broken, favoring higher-priority colors for holes.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (non-zero), tracked with bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and size; 0s are background/empty.
 * Merging rules are color- and position-specific: e.g., attach 4 (orange?) directly below 6 (purple?) by expanding bbox and adding size; merge 3 (green) into adjacent 2 (red) if bboxes overlap or touch horizontally/vertically/diagonally (via custom adjacent_or_overlap check); attach 5 (yellow?) to 9 (pink?) if within 1-2 rows above and ccols overlap; remove isolated 4s near 9s; merge 6 and 8 (gray?) into adjacent 7 (blue) by expanding bbox; merge all 3s (greens) into a single component with union bbox; absorb small (<=4 size) non-blue/non-green/non-7/8/9 components into the largest adjacent one.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve or expand bboxes accurately for final filling; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust 4-to-6 before removing 4s near 9s); adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row+1 or col+1); final grid is filled by largest components first (size-descending) within their bboxes, overwriting smaller ones; always transpose at end (rows become cols); 0s remain unfilled unless propagated to; small components might be noise to absorb; blues (7) seem central/absorbing; greens (3) are special-cased to merge globally.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have varying sizes; components might not touch but be positionally related (e.g., vertical stacking); priorities ensure e.g., 3 (high pri 10) fills aggressively over lower ones like 4 (pri 3); disconnected same-color parts stay separate unless explicitly merged; no diagonal connectivity in components; background 0s don't propagate.
 * All training examples failed, suggesting over-merging (e.g., everything to 7s), incorrect adjacency (e.g., missing vertical merges), wrong filling priorities, or bbox expansion errors leading to uniform grids; transposition might be applied correctly but on wrong base grid.

(The various adjust/merge functions like adjust_four_to_six, adjust_three_to_two, etc., are helpful scaffolds for rule-specific logic but are incomplete/buggy in execution order or conditions, leading to over-merging; e.g., adjust_five_to_nine checks r1 > r4 and r1 <= r4+2 for vertical proximity. create_filled_grid is useful for reconstructing but overwrites via size-order, which may cause loss of details. transpose is correct and essential.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect merging and filling, resulting in over-simplification (e.g., uniform colors) or misplaced components.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly 7s with small 3-block in center-left and 9-block bottom-left; expected vertical 3s on right (rows 0-3,11-12?), horizontal 3s bottom (rows 4-6), and 0s in bottom-left (rows 7-11); difference: failed to propagate/absorb correctly, greens not merged/positioned right, no 0s preserved, unknown why 7s dominated (perhaps priority 8 too high or wrong bbox expansion).
 * Train 2: Generated horizontal 3s (rows 2-4,8-9) and mixed 9s/7s bottom-right; expected 6s top/mid-left, 3s left, 8s mid, 9s bottom-right with 7s right; difference: no 6/8 creation, 3s not confined left, 9s over-expanded, 7s misplaced (e.g., single 7s inside); suggests merge_six_into_seven and merge_eight_into_seven not triggering or wrong adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated 3-block left-mid, 7s mid, 9s top-right, isolated 5/4 right; expected 5s top-left, 3s mid-right, 7/8/6 mid, 4s bottom-right; difference: 5 not merged to anything, 4 not removed/attached, 6/8 not formed/merged to 7, 3s wrong position; unknown why 9s propagated up, but bbox overlap likely failed for vertical stacks.
 * Train 4: Generated entire grid as 2s (total overwrite); expected 6s top/bottom, 3s mid-left, 2s right; difference: everything absorbed into 2s via absorb_small_non_blues or wrong filling, no distinction of 6/3; highlights over-aggressive absorption (threshold=4 too low?) or missing specific merges for 6/3.
 * fill_holes works partially (fills 1s) but priorities cause wrong color dominance (e.g., 7 over everything).
 * find_connected_components is solid for extraction but assumes post-fill grid.
 * Merging functions (e.g., adjust_three_to_two) are helpful but buggy: e.g., global merge_all_greens too broad, causing loss in Train 1; remove_four_near_nine deletes too much/little.
 * bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap misses gap-tolerant rules (e.g., for 5-to-9).
 * create_filled_grid overwrites small details due to size-sorting.
 * No functions for input parsing or validation; unhelpful as is.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of components/merging but fail on rule precision, order, and propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive 9-blocks dominating top/mid (rows 0-14,19-24? with minor 8s in row5-7 col8 and row15-24 col22-29), a vertical 6-strip mid-right (cols14-26 rows0-14), and small 7-block bottom-left (rows25-27 cols1-4); this seems like over-propagation of 9s (high pri 9) filling most space, with 6s/8s/7s as remnants, but lacks diversity/variety expected in puzzles (e.g., no 3s/greens merged, possible 0s missing, 8s not fully merged to 7). It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no balanced 6/7/3/2 like Train 4/2), suggesting same issues: wrong priorities causing 9-flood, incomplete merges (e.g., 7s small/not absorbing), and bbox filling overwriting subtly; mentally, if test input has scattered shapes, output should have merged clusters (e.g., greens global, smalls to blues) with preserved empties, not 9-monolith—likely incorrect due to unhandled vertical/horizontal specifics or absorption threshold.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

Basic grid dimensions utility, useful for bounds checking.

    # (Full implementation as in the program: BFS to find non-blue components and separately blue components)
    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image segmentation and region merging, where input grids with colors (including placeholder 1s to be resolved) represent partial or noisy images of shapes or letters, and the goal is to process them into clean, expected outputs by filling ambiguities, identifying connected components, and applying color-specific merge/expansion rules to form coherent regions that match target patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are transposed at the end, so row/column orientations must account for this (e.g., what appears vertical in input may need horizontal processing post-transpose).
 * Placeholder 1s must be iteratively filled based on the most common adjacent non-1 color, propagating changes until stable; this resolves ambiguities but can over-smooth if not handled carefully.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), tracked by bounding boxes (bbox) and size; components of the same color are grouped, but merges happen across specific color pairs or conditions.
 * Specific merge rules: 4-regions adjacent below 6-regions merge into 6 (vertical adjacency check); 5-regions near (dist 1-2 rows below) 9-regions merge into 9; 3 (green) regions adjacent or overlapping with 2 merge into 2; 6 and 7 are complements (13 - color) and merge if adjacent/overlapping, preferring the larger size; all 3 (green) regions across the grid are union-merged into one large green blob regardless of connectivity.
 * Expansion rules: 8 (maroon) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, recalculating size as full bbox area (assumes solid fill); small components (<=4 cells, excluding 3/8/9) absorb into the largest adjacent component if overlapping/adjacent.
 * 9-regions absorb into adjacent 8 if smaller; final grid is filled by largest-to-smallest components to avoid overlaps, but this can overwrite if bboxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row/col +1 checks); merges modify in-place with deepcopy to avoid mutation issues, but loops must handle index shifts (e.g., del i requires i adjustment); greens (3) are special-cased for global union, ignoring connectivity; small absorptions prioritize largest neighbor; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust merges before absorb small); unmerged components retain original color but may be overwritten in final fill; 0s remain empty/background.
 * Easy-to-miss: Bbox calculations must update min/max correctly during merges; size is pixel count, not bbox area (except post-expansion for 8); counter for filling 1s uses most_common, breaking ties arbitrarily; no diagonal connectivity; potential over-merging if adjacency is too loose; transpose flips the grid, so expected outputs are post-transpose views.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * adjust_four_to_six: Too restrictive (only exact row+1 below, col overlap); misses diagonal or partial adjacencies, leading to unmerged 4s in train 3.
 * adjust_five_to_nine: Distance check (1-2 rows) is arbitrary and fails if not vertically aligned perfectly; doesn't handle horizontal offsets well.
 * adjust_three_to_two: Relies on is_adjacent_or_overlap, but in train 1, it didn't trigger enough, leaving scattered 3s.
 * merge_six_and_seven: Loop breaks on first change but uses while changed outer loop; buggy index handling (i -=1 only in one branch) causes skipped merges or infinite loops in complex cases.
 * merge_all_greens: Unions all 3s globally, which over-merges disconnected greens (e.g., train 1 expected separate 3s in top/right, but this creates one blob covering unrelated areas).
 * expand_maroon: Assumes solid rectangular fill for size post-expansion, but if 8 has holes/gaps, size overestimates; vertical-only expansion misses horizontal needs in some cases.
 * absorb_small_components: Good intent, but excludes 3/8/9 arbitrarily (why not absorb small 9s elsewhere?); sorts by size but always picks largest, ignoring color compatibility.
 * absorb_nine_to_maroon: Only if 9 smaller than 8 and adjacent; but in train 2, 9s weren't absorbed properly, leaving them separate.
 * Overall program: Order of calls (e.g., merge greens after 6/7) can conflict; no handling for color 0s or backgrounds; final fill assumes rectangular bboxes are solid, but components may not be.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of merge triggers and order.
 * Train 1: Generated scattered 7s/8s with misplaced 3/4/9; expected large vertical 3s on right/top and 7s, with 0s bottom-left. What worked: Filled 1s and found some components (e.g., large 7/8 blocks). What didn't: Failed to merge all 3s into disconnected vertical strips (global union overdid it); 4s not merged to 6 (no 6 present?); small 3 absorbed wrong; transpose may have flipped placements incorrectly. Mismatch: Generated has horizontal 3 in row 3, but expected vertical 3s; unknown why 4/9 block bottom-middle instead of 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 9s bottom-right; expected mixed 6/7/3/8/9 with specific placements (e.g., 6 left, 8 middle, 9 bottom-right). What worked: Merged some 3s into rows, detected 8/9 adjacency. What didn't: No 6/7 merging (colors not complemented properly); 9s not absorbed into 8 or expanded; 3s over-merged horizontally instead of keeping shape. Mismatch: Generated lacks 6/7 entirely, has uniform 3 rows vs. expected irregular 3/8/6/9.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal 6/3/4/8 with small 5s; expected vertical 5/3/7/8/6/4/9 patterns. What worked: Detected 6/8 blocks, some 3/4 adjacency. What didn't: 5s left as small unabsorbed (should merge?); 4s not adjusted to 6; no 7/9 handling; bbox overlaps caused overwrite to wrong colors. Mismatch: Generated has uniform rows, but expected has vertical stacks (e.g., 5 top-left, 6 middle-right); 5s appear top-right instead of left.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical 2s left/bottom with 6s middle; expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers. What worked: Merged 2s into large block bottom, some 6 detection. What didn't: No 3-to-2 merge (3s absorbed wrong or missing); 6s not expanded or positioned right; transpose flipped to vertical but expected horizontal. Mismatch: Generated 2s dominate left, but expected 2s right/bottom; 3s vanished entirely (over-absorbed?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive uniform 9 blocks top/middle/bottom with thin 6 strip middle-right, small 8 horizontal bottom, and misplaced 7/4 bottom-middle. This seems over-merged (e.g., all top/middle as 9, ignoring shapes), with no 3s/2s/5s visible and irregular 4/7 insertion bottom. Expected likely has more varied regions (e.g., vertical/horizontal bands of 6/8/9/3 like training, with merges forming letters/shapes); current output lacks structure, has unexplained 4-block in bottom-middle (unmerged?), and 8 not expanded properly. Transpose may have distorted vertical elements to horizontal. It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no global green union visible, small components not absorbed cleanly), suggesting misses in color-specific rules for this larger grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:27:06] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers 0-9, where 0 is likely empty/background), where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply specific merging, transformation, absorption, or expansion rules based on color, position, adjacency, and size, and then refill the grid with the resulting dominant colors to match an expected simplified or transformed pattern. The rules appear to simulate object recognition or flood-filling in a puzzle like Nonogram or region-merging, but with color-specific interactions that propagate changes (e.g., one color influencing another based on vertical/horizontal proximity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), excluding 0 (background) and 1 (possibly a special case like walls or ignored); bounding boxes (bbox) track min/max rows/columns for efficient overlap checks.
 * Merging is directional and conditional: e.g., color 4 directly below (row+1) a 6 with column overlap merges into the 6 (changing 4 to 6); color 5 below (dist 1 or 2 rows) a 9 merges into 9. These suggest vertical stacking rules, possibly for "attaching" base to top in puzzle objects.
 * 6 and 7 merge if adjacent or overlapping (with gap <=1 row/col), prioritizing larger size or rightmost (max column) for the target, and using the rightmost's color if tied— this implies horizontal/vertical chaining for similar colors, but the color choice (e.g., preferring 7 over 6) is critical and may need adjustment based on right-to-left or other priority.
 * Small components (<=4 cells, excluding protected colors 0,3,8,9) get absorbed into the largest adjacent component (gap <=1), expanding the target's bbox and size—this handles "noise" or minor protrusions but skips key colors like green (3) or maroon (8), suggesting 3 and 8 are "special" or structural.
 * All green (3) components merge into a single union bbox regardless of adjacency, preserving color 3—this implies greens represent a global feature (e.g., grass or background fill) that consolidates across the grid.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down (clamped to grid edges), recalculating size as full bbox area—this suggests 8 is a "border" or "foundation" that thickens, but ignores horizontal expansion and assumes rectangular fill.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size descending and overwrites with color in bbox order, which can cause larger components to override smaller ones in overlaps—subtle issue if bboxes overlap post-merge, as it may not handle partial fills or priorities correctly.
 * Gaps in adjacency (e.g., <=1 empty cell) allow "near" merges, but only for specific pairs (6/7); stricter for others (e.g., exact row+1 for 4->6).
 * Colors like 2,5,9 have specific interactions (e.g., 5->9), but 2 is untreated in the code, suggesting missing rules for it (possibly absorption or separate merge).
 * Protected colors (0,3,8,9) aren't absorbed, implying they are "final" or dominant; 1 is ignored in component finding, possibly a divider or invalid.
 * Subtleties: Merging loops must iterate until no changes (while changed), but deletion during iteration risks skipping/index errors (code uses del and continues, but may miss multi-merges). Bbox overlap check includes exact overlap + adjacent with gap<=1, but only vertical/horizontal (no diagonal). Size recalc in expand_maroon assumes full rectangle fill, which may overfill non-rectangular shapes. No handling for color 2 (appears in test/gen but untreated). Global green merge ignores position, which may create oversized bboxes that override others incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical priority (e.g., below attachments change to upper color); rightmost tiebreaker for 6/7; exclusion of 0/1 from components; sorting by size in final fill (larger dominates overlaps).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed to match expected outputs, indicating core merging rules are incomplete or incorrectly prioritized (e.g., 6/7 merge exists but doesn't produce the expected 7-dominant fills in Train 1).
 * Train 1 generated scattered 6's, isolated 3, partial 4/9 merges, and expanded 8 at bottom, but expected a large 7 block with vertical 3 strip on right—missed full 6->7 propagation and green (3) placement/expansion; 4->6 merge didn't trigger or chain properly, leaving 4's visible.
 * Train 2 generated vertical 8's on left, merged 3's, but isolated 9's and no 6/7—expected horizontal 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 in middle; absorb_small didn't handle 3's correctly (over-merged?), and no 6 creation from other colors.
 * Train 3 generated partial 6/3/4 stacks and separate 8/9/5, but expected integrated 5/7/8/6/3/4 with 5 on top and 7/8 left—vertical merges (e.g., 5->9) didn't apply or chain to create 7; small 5 component not absorbed; green merge created wrong bbox.
 * Train 4 generated fragmented 6/3/2 with 0 gaps preserved, but expected solid 6/3/2 bands wrapping around—absorb_small failed on 2 (untreated color), no rule for 2->6 or similar; greens merged but not positioned to fill expected areas.
 * merge_six_and_seven is partially helpful but broken in color choice/tiebreaker (prefers wrong color, e.g., keeps 6 instead of 7); iteration deletes components but may skip multi-merges in chains.
 * handle_four_to_six and handle_five_to_nine are specific but too narrow (only vertical below, no horizontal or chaining); didn't trigger in trains where expected (e.g., Train 3's 4/5).
 * absorb_small_components skips key colors but absorbs others too aggressively or not at all (e.g., didn't absorb 2 in Train 4); gap<=1 may be too loose, causing unwanted merges.
 * merge_all_greens unions all 3's globally, which worked partially (consolidated in trains) but created oversized bboxes that overrode other areas incorrectly (e.g., Train 1's single 3 spot vs. expected strip).
 * expand_maroon only vertical expansion, assumes rectangular fill (overfills non-rects); helpful for 8 thickening but didn't match expectations (e.g., Train 3's 8 integration).
 * Overall, component finding and bbox tools are solid foundations; final fill works but size-sort causes override issues if merges don't create expected large components. Missing rules for color 2 (appears untreated, leads to fragments). Loops for iterative merging are good but inefficient/buggy with del during iteration. No handling for 1 (ignored correctly?) or propagation (e.g., merged 6+7 becoming 7 then merging further).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate understanding of the puzzle rules, as it preserves too many original colors (e.g., scattered 2's, 3's, 4's, 7's, 8's, 9's) without sufficient merging into dominant bands or blocks seen in training expectations (e.g., no large unified 7 or 6 like Train 1/2, no wrapping 6/3/2 like Train 4).
 * It shows partial vertical merges (e.g., 3's in a tall strip on left/middle, 4's on bottom-right, 2's in a block mid-bottom, 8's expanded at bottom), but leaves gaps and fragments (e.g., isolated 7's in row 1-2, small 8 intrusions); this mismatches expected patterns of full horizontal/vertical consolidation (e.g., Train 2's clean 6/7 rows, Train 3's integrated left 7/8/6).
 * 9's dominate top/left but don't absorb or transform others (e.g., no 5->9 chaining if present in input); 8 expansion happened but only vertically, creating a thick bottom band that overrides partially but leaves 4's adjacent without merge.
 * 2's form a large block but aren't absorbed/merged (untreated color), suggesting missing rule for 2 (possibly merge into adjacent like 6/7); overall, output looks like incomplete processing—too fragmented, no global green union effect visible, and size-sort fill didn't create the clean, blocky expected styles.
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exact target, but based on trains, it should simplify to fewer colors in larger regions (e.g., 9 absorbing 3's? or 7 chaining rightward); current gen seems "half-applied" rules, not fully transformed.

[2025-10-03 16:27:07] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

    # Not broken, but application after expansions mismatches expected block alignments.
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color transformation, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, position, and specific color interactions, then fill and transpose the resulting grid to match an expected output pattern. The rules seem to simulate "object" simplification or unification in a 2D spatial puzzle, possibly inspired by image segmentation or blob analysis, but with custom color-specific behaviors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and must be of the exact same color; bounding boxes (bbox) are used to approximate regions for adjacency checks, but this can lead to over-merging if not precise (e.g., diagonal or distant touches aren't handled).
 * Small components (size <=4) of blue (1) are absorbed into adjacent non-blues, prioritizing the largest; similarly for small non-blues (size 1-4, excluding colors 3,8,9) into larger ones, but this ignores color compatibility and can swallow unintended areas.
 * Color adjustments: 4 becomes 6 if directly below a 6 (row-adjacent, column-overlap); 3 becomes 2 if adjacent or overlapping with 2; 5 becomes 9 if "near" (within 2 rows, column-overlap) a 9—these are asymmetric and position-dependent, easy to miss row/column specifics or overlap definitions.
 * Merging: Similar colors (6 and 7) merge if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller; all greens (3) are unconditionally merged into one giant component regardless of position— this can distort spatial relationships.
 * Expansion: Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, increasing size accordingly, but only vertically and without checking overlaps.
 * Filling: Components are filled into a grid by bbox (not exact shape), sorted by size (greens prioritized), skipping color 0; final transpose flips rows/columns, which is crucial but can confuse orientation.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touch (horizontal/vertical, but not diagonal); bbox merging can create rectangular approximations that overfill; no handling for isolated singles or color 0 as background; order of operations matters (e.g., absorb before merge); greens (3) seem special (merged all, prioritized in filling); no diagonal connectivity; potential for infinite loops in while loops if not careful; transposition is always applied, so inputs/outputs have swapped dimensions.
 * Overlooked: Rules may not apply universally—e.g., in training 1, greens should form a large block but code places a small 3; in training 2, 6s and 7s don't merge properly, and 8s/9s shift; color 0 appears as empty in expected but not handled; small components might not always absorb (e.g., if no adjacent large); position matters more than size sometimes (e.g., "below" or "near").
 * General: Puzzle likely tests understanding of spatial rules over strict connectivity; expected outputs show more irregular shapes (non-rectangular fills), suggesting bbox filling is too crude—need exact pixel filling or shape preservation.

    # But can false-positive if bboxes touch without actual cell adjacency
    r1, c1, r2, c2 = b1
    r3, c3, r4, c4 = b2
    if max(r1, r3) <= min(r2, r4) and max(c1, c3) <= min(c2, c4):
        return True
    # ... (rest as in code)

def create_filled_grid(components: List[Dict], h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:

    # Transpose after to match expected orientation
```
* `find_adjacent_components`: Uses bbox overlap+1 for "adjacent"; helpful but loose (includes distant if bbox large).
* `is_below` and `is_near`: Position-specific checks; useful for rule application but hardcoded distances (1 row for below, 2 for near) may not generalize.
* Unhelpful/broken functions: `absorb_small_blues` and `absorb_small_non_blues`—they modify in place and filter out absorbed, but don't update colors/sizes accurately and ignore puzzle-specific absorptions (e.g., don't turn absorbed into absorber's color); lead to lost components. `handle_color_adjustments`—while loop with deepcopy is inefficient and deletes during iteration, risking index errors; transformations are too narrow (e.g., misses 6->something). `merge_similar_colors`—only for 6/7, asymmetric absorption; doesn't handle all cases like training 2's 6/7 split. `merge_all_greens`—unconditional global merge ignores spatial separation, causing over-unification (e.g., disconnected greens in expected). `expand_maroon_components`—vertical-only expansion adds phantom size without filling logic; doesn't check boundaries properly. Overall, these are puzzle-specific guesses that don't align with expected outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single comprehensive attempt with multiple rule functions chained in `program`; it demonstrates understanding of connected components and bbox-based processing but fails all training due to incorrect rule assumptions.
 * Training 1: Generated large 7 blocks on left/top with misplaced small 3, bottom 4/9 blocks shifted right; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s in middle/bottom, 0s as background—code over-absorbed blues/non-blues into 7s, didn't merge greens properly into large block, expanded 8s wrongly, and 4/9 didn't transform correctly; transposition may have oriented wrong.
 * Training 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 8/9 on right; expected has 6s merging across, 8s in middle, 9s bottom-right, 7s top-right—code merged all 3s too aggressively, didn't convert/merge 6/7/8 properly, absorbed smalls into 3s instead of transforming, resulting in no 6/8/9 positions.
 * Training 3: Generated horizontal 6s top, 3/4/8 blocks middle with trailing 4s; expected has 5s top-left, vertical 3s, mixed 7/8/6/4 on sides—code didn't handle 5->9 nearness, kept 4s separate instead of below->6, expanded 8s horizontally wrongly, no 5/7 placement, greens not merged right.
 * Training 4: Generated vertical 2s left, full 6s middle, bottom 2s; expected has horizontal 6s top/bottom, vertical 3s middle, 2s right—code absorbed 2/3 into 6s wrongly, didn't preserve 3s as separate vertical, merged 2s prematurely, no 3 block formation.
 * Common issues: Bbox filling creates rectangles over irregular shapes (e.g., expected has non-full bboxes); absorption/merging too aggressive/generic, ignoring color pairs (e.g., 3+2->2, but code merges greens all); position rules (below/near) under-applied; transposition applied but inputs may need row/col swap consideration; no handling for 0 as explicit empty; size thresholds (4) arbitrary and miss cases; order (absorb -> adjust -> merge) causes cascade errors.
 * `find_connected_components` is essential and correct for extraction; others like `merge_all_greens` are overkill/unhelpful as they ignore adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a large 30-column grid (likely transposed from ~20x30 input) with massive 9 blocks on left/bottom, vertical 2s/6s in middle, small 8s bottom-right, and irregular 7/4 in bottom— but patterns are overly rectangular and uniform, suggesting bbox overfill without shape respect.
 * Issues: Huge 9s dominate left (rows 0-30 cols 0-1, scattered elsewhere), but expected likely has more mixed/spatial merges (e.g., 2s absorbed into 9s?); 6s form tall vertical strip (cols 14-26), but training patterns suggest horizontal/oriented merges; 8s are small clustered bottom-right, but expansion rule may overgrow them; 4s appear as block in bottom-middle without transformation (e.g., to 6 if below); 7s small top-bottom left; overall, lacks subtlety like near-merges or color shifts seen in training expecteds (e.g., no visible 3/5 handling, potential 0 empties missing).
 * Doesn't match expected logic: Based on training, test should show merged greens (3) if present, positioned transformations (e.g., 4 below 6), and non-rect fills; instead, it's blob-like with wrong colors (e.g., persistent 2s/4s not absorbed/transformed); transposition may hide input orientation issues. Unknown why 9s are so pervasive—possibly over-absorption of smalls into 9s—but it disrupts balance seen in expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the processing of 2D grids of integers (likely representing colored pixels or regions) to transform noisy or patterned inputs into cleaner, structured outputs that reveal shapes, fill regions, or apply geometric rules like symmetry, connectivity, or boundary detection. The goal is to produce exact matches to expected grids, which seem to emphasize uniform region filling, edge preservation, and possibly object extraction or pattern completion across varying grid sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent visual elements like shapes or blobs of colors (integers 0-9), and transformations must preserve overall structure while cleaning noise, such as isolated pixels or irregular boundaries, without over-smoothing large regions.
 * Expected outputs often show sharp, rectangular or stepped region boundaries (e.g., solid blocks of the same number), suggesting rules for flood-filling connected components or propagating colors based on majority in neighborhoods, but with constraints on directionality or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements include handling non-square grids (e.g., training example 2 is 10x10 but output varies in pattern density), maintaining aspect ratios after any rotation/transposition, and avoiding propagation across disconnected regions—e.g., in training 1, expected has distinct horizontal bands of 7,3,0 without vertical bleed.
 * Connectivity is 4-way (up/down/left/right) rather than 8-way, as diagonal fills are not evident in expectations; noise like single pixels (e.g., potential 1s or 2s in inputs) should be absorbed into dominant neighbors but not spread indefinitely.
 * Patterns may involve symmetry or mirroring (e.g., training 4 expected has repeating rows), and color propagation seems biased toward lower rows/columns in some cases, possibly indicating gravity-like settling or top-down filling.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must exactly match row-by-row, including trailing same-color extensions (e.g., training 1 ends with consistent 7s); over-smoothing can merge unrelated regions (seen in generated outputs with excessive 6/7/8 blending).
 * Across attempts, consider irregular shapes like Ls, Ts, or irregular blobs—rules likely involve bounding boxes or contour following to straighten edges.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x16 in training 1, 10x10 in 2 and 4, 9x14 in 3), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; inputs may have noise levels that require iterative but limited passes to avoid total homogenization.
 * Potential rules: Identify "objects" as connected components of the same color, then expand/contract them to fit expected clean shapes; or apply morphological operations like dilation/erosion before filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used transposition followed by iterative majority-vote smoothing (3x3 neighborhood), which partially denoises small noise but fails to produce structured region fills, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * What worked: Smoothing correctly absorbs some isolated noise (e.g., in training 1, it consolidated lower regions into 4s and 7s, reducing scattered values), and transposition handles orientation swaps, which might be relevant if puzzles involve rotation.
 * What didn't work: Over-smoothing merged distinct regions (e.g., in training 1, generated has gradual gradients of 6->7->8->4 instead of sharp 7/3/0 bands; expected has clear horizontal separation not achieved). In training 2, it failed to isolate small features like 1s or create the expected stepped pattern with 6/8/9. Training 3 generated irregular fills (e.g., partial 3/4/8 blobs) missing the expected clean rows and columns. Training 4 preserved some repetition but incorrectly propagated 2/3/6 without matching the alternating row structure.
 * Transposition alone is unhelpful or broken for these cases, as inputs/outputs don't show consistent row-column swaps (e.g., training 1 expected keeps horizontal bands post-any transform).
 * Majority smoothing function is somewhat helpful for noise reduction but not for the puzzle, as it lacks color-specific rules or connectivity—leads to diffusion rather than precise filling (e.g., in training 1, 6s dominate top where 7s expected).
 * No object extraction was used, missing key for identifying and cleaning blobs; generated outputs show blended colors (e.g., 6/7/8 in training 1) instead of expected pure zones.
 * Iterative smoothing (3 passes) exacerbated blending without boundaries, causing mismatches like training 2's generated 7/8/3/1/5 mess vs. expected clean 6/3/8/9 blocks.
 * extract_objects-like function absent, so no handling of multiple components; this is essential for puzzles with separate regions (e.g., training 3's multiple 3/4/6/8 groups).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a highly irregular, noisy grid with scattered 0/2/3/6/7/8/9 values forming no clear shapes or uniform regions, suggesting over-smoothed chaos rather than structured output (e.g., rows 14-15 have mixed 2/6/9, while earlier rows blend 0/3/6/9 without boundaries).
 * It differs from what we'd expect based on training patterns: likely clean, blocky regions (e.g., large 9 areas with inset 3/6/0/2 shapes, similar to training 1's bands), but generated has jagged edges and unexplained intrusions (e.g., isolated 7s in row 25, 4s in rows 26-29) that don't form expected symmetries or fills—possibly the smoothing propagated noise incorrectly without connectivity rules.
 * No clear propagation or filling observed (e.g., bottom-right 4/8 block looks partial and unmatched to training's uniform ends); this indicates the approach fails on larger, more complex grids with multiple interacting regions.
 * To handle test case, need rules for hierarchical filling (e.g., largest components first) or boundary detection to prevent bleed, as current output homogenizes too much without preserving subtle separations seen in training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual denoising puzzle where the input grid contains numbers representing colors or patterns, with 0 and 1 acting as noise or background/foreground artifacts, and the goal is to reconstruct a cleaner, blocky version by identifying large uniform rectangular regions (stripes or blocks) and filling them with the dominant (mode) value while ignoring noise. The output should consist of large, consistent horizontal and vertical blocks of the same number, smoothing out irregularities to reveal an underlying structured pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have noise (0 and 1) that should be ignored when computing modes or dominant values in rows, columns, or segments; never treat 0 or 1 as valid pattern values unless they form a dominant block themselves (which is rare).
 * Identify vertical stripes first by scanning columns and grouping consecutive columns with the same mode (ignoring noise), then subdivide those stripes horizontally into sub-blocks with uniform row modes.
 * Sub-blocks should be rectangular and as large as possible; small anomalies (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s, or minority values) should be overridden by the surrounding dominant value, but consistent minority patterns might indicate separate sub-blocks.
 * Horizontal symmetry or repetition in expected outputs suggests checking for repeated rows or patterns across the grid; vertical stripes may not span the full height, so subdivide vertically within each stripe.
 * Anomalies should be detected but not propagated—use them only to refine boundaries, not to fill the output; top anomalies (e.g., via Counter) can help identify if a block needs splitting but aren't directly used for filling.
 * Transposing the grid (as in the current program) scrambles the structure and doesn't align with blocky expected outputs, which preserve row/column orientations.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-column or single-row grids should mode the entire thing ignoring noise; blocks may abut without separators, and noise can form thin lines or spots that must be smoothed over.
 * Subtle elements: Dominant value in a segment is the most common non-0/1 number; if no non-noise values, default to 0; outputs are always the same dimensions as input; patterns may shift midway (e.g., a vertical stripe changing mode partway down), requiring vertical subdivision.
 * Across attempts, noise often leaks into outputs (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s remain), and blocks aren't fully filled—e.g., in Train 1, generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s with noise, but expected has clean 7/3/0 blocks; ensure filling propagates the mode across the entire detected block.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed because the main program only transposes the grid (via zip(*g)), which rotates it 90 degrees and preserves noise without any denoising or block-filling, leading to scrambled, noisy outputs that don't match the clean, blocky expected grids.
 * Train 1 generated: Mostly 6s/7s/8s with scattered 1s/0s and irregular shapes (e.g., row 0 has ten 6s then 7s/8s; row 3 has a 3 in noise); expected: Clean horizontal blocks of 7s (rows 0-3), 3s (rows 4-6), 0s (rows 7-11) with vertical shifts at columns 10-12—generated mismatches by not filling full blocks and leaking noise (e.g., 1s in expected 7/3 areas).
 * Train 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/3s with heavy noise (e.g., row 1 has 7s then 8s/1s; row 6 has 1s/9s/5s); expected: Top 3 rows full 6s ending in 7s, then 3/8/6/7 blocks with a bottom 3/8/9/7 pattern—generated fails to group into large blocks, keeps 1s/6s as noise instead of smoothing to dominants like 6/7/8/9.
 * Train 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/4s/8s with 1s scattered (e.g., row 1 has 1s in middle; row 7 has 1s/7); expected: Top 3 rows 5s then 3s, middle 7/8/6/3 blocks, bottom 7/8/6/4—generated doesn't detect vertical/horizontal subdivisions properly, resulting in partial fills and noise retention (unknown why 5s appear where 3s expected, possibly from miscomputed modes).
 * Train 4 generated: Irregular 2s/6s/3s with 1s (e.g., row 0 has 2s/6s/1; row 7 has 3s/1s); expected: Top 3 and bottom 3 rows full 6s/2s, middle 7 rows 3s/2s—generated fails to smooth vertical columns into blocks, keeps noise like 1s in 6/3 areas.
 * The stripe-finding and subdivision functions are sketched but unused in the main program, so they don't impact outputs; anomaly detection is helpful for refinement but overkill if not integrated into filling.
 * Transposing is broken and unhelpful— it changes the grid orientation without denoising, worsening matches (don't use in future).
 * No attempts passed, showing incomplete integration of denoising logic; core issue is lack of a full reconstruction step to create a new grid by filling detected blocks with their modes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it remains highly noisy and irregular, with scattered 0s/1s/2s/3s/6s/8s/9s across rows (e.g., row 0 has 14 9s then 14 6s; row 12 has mixed 9s/3s/0s/1s/6s; row 24 has 9s/7s/1s), forming no clear large blocks, whereas a correct output should have smooth, rectangular regions of uniform numbers (e.g., large 9/3/6/2/8/4/7 blocks based on apparent patterns in the input).
 * It appears to be a slightly modified version of the input (possibly transposed or partially processed), but noise persists heavily (e.g., isolated 1s in row 13, 0s in row 14), and structures like potential vertical 9-stripe on left or 6-stripe in middle aren't fully filled or subdivided horizontally.
 * Bottom rows show some blockiness (e.g., row 25 has 9/7s/1s/4s/9s/8s), but it's inconsistent and doesn't align with expected denoising—likely failed because the program doesn't apply stripe/subdivision logic to build a new clean grid.
 * Overall, it makes no sense as a solution; it looks like raw input with minor artifacts rather than a reconstructed puzzle, missing the block-filling to handle test's complex noise (e.g., diagonal-ish 0/1 lines and small 2/8 intrusions that should be smoothed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that appears to involve simplifying a noisy or detailed grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty and 1 as holes) into a cleaner, blocky representation of larger rectangular regions dominated by a single color per block, likely by identifying and expanding dominant color modes while ignoring or filling insignificant elements like isolated cells or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent images with colors (integers 2+), 0s as empty space to ignore in mode calculations, and 1s as "holes" that need filling with nearby colors, but filling must preserve overall block structures rather than blending everything.
 * Dominant colors in columns or rows should form "stripes" or sub-blocks, but the process must handle irregular shapes: vertical/horizontal grouping should be based on modes of non-0 cells, yet avoid over-generalizing across breaks in patterns (e.g., don't merge columns with the same mode if interrupted by different dominant regions).
 * Transposition (rotating the grid) is applied at the end, suggesting the simplification might need to work in a specific orientation (e.g., vertical stripes first, then horizontal subdivision), but this can distort results if the initial direction is wrong—subtleties include checking if horizontal stripes or no transpose would better match expected blocky outputs.
 * 0s in expected outputs indicate preserved empty space, so the simplification should not fill everything; blocks should only expand to cover areas where a color truly dominates, leaving gaps as 0.
 * Subtle elements: Modes must ignore 0s but not overcount minorities; BFS for hole-filling works for proximity but fails if it propagates wrong colors across boundaries (e.g., in training 1, it seems to flood 6s and 7s incorrectly into areas that should be 3s or 0s). Patterns often have asymmetric blocks (e.g., L-shapes or offsets), so rigid rectangular subdivision misses curves or steps. Expected outputs show crisp, uniform blocks without noise, implying a need to detect and uniformize regions beyond simple modes—consider connected components or flood-fill for true blobs rather than column/row modes.
 * Across attempts, no handling for multi-color transitions within stripes (e.g., training 2 has mixed 3,6,8 but generated merges wrongly); also, widths/heights of blocks must match exactly (e.g., training 3 generated irregular 4s and 6s where expected has clean horizontal bands).
 * General: Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; test input is larger (28x30?), with complex nested patterns including 0s as separators.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter, deque

def fill_holes(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Fill all 1's with the nearest non-1 color using multi-source BFS."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return g
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    grid = [row[:] for row in g]
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    q = deque()
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if grid[i][j] != 1:
                q.append((i, j, grid[i][j]))
                visited[i][j] = True
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while q:
        x, y, color = q.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < h and 0 <= ny < w and not visited[nx][ny] and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                grid[nx][ny] = color
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny, color))
    return grid
```
(This BFS hole-filling is helpful for proximity-based completion but needs refinement to avoid over-propagation across block boundaries; useful as a preprocessing step.)

```python
def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:
    """Compute mode ignoring 0."""
    count = Counter(x for x in lst if x != 0)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This mode function is core and helpful for identifying dominant colors in rows/columns/segments, ignoring 0s correctly; should be retained and possibly extended to weighted or thresholded modes.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(Transposition is helpful for reorienting if the puzzle requires processing in rows vs. columns, but in this attempt it's applied too late or wrongly, leading to mismatches; consider applying earlier or conditionally.)

(Note: No explicit object extraction function was in this attempt, but one could be added for blob detection via flood-fill to identify connected components of same color, which might better capture non-rectangular blocks before rectangular approximation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples by producing over-smoothed or misaligned blocky grids: e.g., in Train 1, generated uniform horizontal bands of 6/7/4/9 (ignoring expected vertical shifts to 3s and bottom 0s), likely due to vertical stripe grouping propagating modes across row changes incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated merged 7s and 3s into incorrect positions (e.g., top 7s where expected has 6s, and scattered 5s at bottom), missing the expected stepped pattern with 8/6/9 transitions—subdivision didn't capture horizontal offsets.
 * Train 3: Generated repetitive 6/3/4/8 patterns with irregularities (e.g., isolated 5/9 intrusions), while expected has clean horizontal stripes (5/3 then 7/8/6/4 bands); mode computation in sub-blocks failed to uniformize vertical variations.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical stacks of 2/6/4/3 but with inconsistent widths (e.g., 2s not spanning full expected height), missing the expected alternating 6/3/2 bands—stripe finding didn't handle row-mode changes properly within columns.
 * Overall, what worked: Hole-filling via BFS correctly propagates colors locally (no unfilled 1s in outputs), and mode computation ignores 0s appropriately; vertical stripe detection groups similar columns somewhat (e.g., right-side consistencies in Train 1).
 * What didn't work: Build_blocky_grid overfills rectangles without respecting pattern breaks (e.g., creates solid blocks where expected has 0 gaps or color shifts); transpose at end rotates results wrongly, e.g., Train 1 expected is vertical bands but generated looks horizontal post-transpose. Subdivision is too rigid, missing subtle mode changes. No handling for 0 preservation in output. Function find_vertical_stripes is somewhat helpful but broken for non-uniform heights; subdivide_stripe_vertically is unhelpful as it recomputes modes per row-segment without considering full-block connectivity (leads to fragmentation). No object extraction, which might be needed for true block identification—consider adding flood-fill for blobs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a highly uniform, overfilled grid dominated by 9s, 3s, 6s, and 2s in large rectangular bands (e.g., top-heavy 9s, vertical 3/6 stripes, scattered 8s/4s/7s at bottom), but ignores the input's complex structure with 0-separated regions, offsets, and mixed colors (e.g., input has clustered 2s, isolated 0s as dividers, and diagonal-ish transitions around rows 7-22). This results in loss of detail like the input's bottom-right 8s block and mid-grid 2s cluster, replaced by smoothed modes; expected should likely preserve more stepped/offset blocks (e.g., expanding 9s only where dominant, leaving 0 gaps, and uniformizing 2s/6s without bleeding). It doesn't make sense as a simplification because it merges unrelated areas (e.g., top 9s flood into mid-3s), suggesting the vertical-first approach and hole-filling propagate too aggressively without boundary detection.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integer cells (0-9 representing colors or shapes) to simulate object recognition and merging rules, such as filling internal holes with priority-based propagation, identifying connected components of the same color, merging or removing components based on adjacency, position, and color-specific rules (e.g., attaching small shapes to larger ones), and finally reconstructing and transposing the grid to match an expected layout that represents assembled or corrected puzzle pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts with 1s as "holes" to be filled via a priority queue-based flood fill from non-1 cells, where priorities (e.g., {0:0, 2:2, 3:10, 4:3, 5:6, 6:5, 7:8, 8:7, 9:9}) determine which color propagates farthest or ties are broken, favoring higher-priority colors for holes.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (non-zero), tracked with bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and size; 0s are background/empty.
 * Merging rules are color- and position-specific: e.g., attach 4 (orange?) directly below 6 (purple?) by expanding bbox and adding size; merge 3 (green) into adjacent 2 (red) if bboxes overlap or touch horizontally/vertically/diagonally (via custom adjacent_or_overlap check); attach 5 (yellow?) to 9 (pink?) if within 1-2 rows above and ccols overlap; remove isolated 4s near 9s; merge 6 and 8 (gray?) into adjacent 7 (blue) by expanding bbox; merge all 3s (greens) into a single component with union bbox; absorb small (<=4 size) non-blue/non-green/non-7/8/9 components into the largest adjacent one.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve or expand bboxes accurately for final filling; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust 4-to-6 before removing 4s near 9s); adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row+1 or col+1); final grid is filled by largest components first (size-descending) within their bboxes, overwriting smaller ones; always transpose at end (rows become cols); 0s remain unfilled unless propagated to; small components might be noise to absorb; blues (7) seem central/absorbing; greens (3) are special-cased to merge globally.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have varying sizes; components might not touch but be positionally related (e.g., vertical stacking); priorities ensure e.g., 3 (high pri 10) fills aggressively over lower ones like 4 (pri 3); disconnected same-color parts stay separate unless explicitly merged; no diagonal connectivity in components; background 0s don't propagate.
 * All training examples failed, suggesting over-merging (e.g., everything to 7s), incorrect adjacency (e.g., missing vertical merges), wrong filling priorities, or bbox expansion errors leading to uniform grids; transposition might be applied correctly but on wrong base grid.

(The various adjust/merge functions like adjust_four_to_six, adjust_three_to_two, etc., are helpful scaffolds for rule-specific logic but are incomplete/buggy in execution order or conditions, leading to over-merging; e.g., adjust_five_to_nine checks r1 > r4 and r1 <= r4+2 for vertical proximity. create_filled_grid is useful for reconstructing but overwrites via size-order, which may cause loss of details. transpose is correct and essential.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect merging and filling, resulting in over-simplification (e.g., uniform colors) or misplaced components.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly 7s with small 3-block in center-left and 9-block bottom-left; expected vertical 3s on right (rows 0-3,11-12?), horizontal 3s bottom (rows 4-6), and 0s in bottom-left (rows 7-11); difference: failed to propagate/absorb correctly, greens not merged/positioned right, no 0s preserved, unknown why 7s dominated (perhaps priority 8 too high or wrong bbox expansion).
 * Train 2: Generated horizontal 3s (rows 2-4,8-9) and mixed 9s/7s bottom-right; expected 6s top/mid-left, 3s left, 8s mid, 9s bottom-right with 7s right; difference: no 6/8 creation, 3s not confined left, 9s over-expanded, 7s misplaced (e.g., single 7s inside); suggests merge_six_into_seven and merge_eight_into_seven not triggering or wrong adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated 3-block left-mid, 7s mid, 9s top-right, isolated 5/4 right; expected 5s top-left, 3s mid-right, 7/8/6 mid, 4s bottom-right; difference: 5 not merged to anything, 4 not removed/attached, 6/8 not formed/merged to 7, 3s wrong position; unknown why 9s propagated up, but bbox overlap likely failed for vertical stacks.
 * Train 4: Generated entire grid as 2s (total overwrite); expected 6s top/bottom, 3s mid-left, 2s right; difference: everything absorbed into 2s via absorb_small_non_blues or wrong filling, no distinction of 6/3; highlights over-aggressive absorption (threshold=4 too low?) or missing specific merges for 6/3.
 * fill_holes works partially (fills 1s) but priorities cause wrong color dominance (e.g., 7 over everything).
 * find_connected_components is solid for extraction but assumes post-fill grid.
 * Merging functions (e.g., adjust_three_to_two) are helpful but buggy: e.g., global merge_all_greens too broad, causing loss in Train 1; remove_four_near_nine deletes too much/little.
 * bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap misses gap-tolerant rules (e.g., for 5-to-9).
 * create_filled_grid overwrites small details due to size-sorting.
 * No functions for input parsing or validation; unhelpful as is.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of components/merging but fail on rule precision, order, and propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive 9-blocks dominating top/mid (rows 0-14,19-24? with minor 8s in row5-7 col8 and row15-24 col22-29), a vertical 6-strip mid-right (cols14-26 rows0-14), and small 7-block bottom-left (rows25-27 cols1-4); this seems like over-propagation of 9s (high pri 9) filling most space, with 6s/8s/7s as remnants, but lacks diversity/variety expected in puzzles (e.g., no 3s/greens merged, possible 0s missing, 8s not fully merged to 7). It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no balanced 6/7/3/2 like Train 4/2), suggesting same issues: wrong priorities causing 9-flood, incomplete merges (e.g., 7s small/not absorbing), and bbox filling overwriting subtly; mentally, if test input has scattered shapes, output should have merged clusters (e.g., greens global, smalls to blues) with preserved empties, not 9-monolith—likely incorrect due to unhandled vertical/horizontal specifics or absorption threshold.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers 0-9, where 0 is likely empty/background), where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply specific merging, transformation, absorption, or expansion rules based on color, position, adjacency, and size, and then refill the grid with the resulting dominant colors to match an expected simplified or transformed pattern. The rules appear to simulate object recognition or flood-filling in a puzzle like Nonogram or region-merging, but with color-specific interactions that propagate changes (e.g., one color influencing another based on vertical/horizontal proximity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), excluding 0 (background) and 1 (possibly a special case like walls or ignored); bounding boxes (bbox) track min/max rows/columns for efficient overlap checks.
 * Merging is directional and conditional: e.g., color 4 directly below (row+1) a 6 with column overlap merges into the 6 (changing 4 to 6); color 5 below (dist 1 or 2 rows) a 9 merges into 9. These suggest vertical stacking rules, possibly for "attaching" base to top in puzzle objects.
 * 6 and 7 merge if adjacent or overlapping (with gap <=1 row/col), prioritizing larger size or rightmost (max column) for the target, and using the rightmost's color if tied— this implies horizontal/vertical chaining for similar colors, but the color choice (e.g., preferring 7 over 6) is critical and may need adjustment based on right-to-left or other priority.
 * Small components (<=4 cells, excluding protected colors 0,3,8,9) get absorbed into the largest adjacent component (gap <=1), expanding the target's bbox and size—this handles "noise" or minor protrusions but skips key colors like green (3) or maroon (8), suggesting 3 and 8 are "special" or structural.
 * All green (3) components merge into a single union bbox regardless of adjacency, preserving color 3—this implies greens represent a global feature (e.g., grass or background fill) that consolidates across the grid.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down (clamped to grid edges), recalculating size as full bbox area—this suggests 8 is a "border" or "foundation" that thickens, but ignores horizontal expansion and assumes rectangular fill.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size descending and overwrites with color in bbox order, which can cause larger components to override smaller ones in overlaps—subtle issue if bboxes overlap post-merge, as it may not handle partial fills or priorities correctly.
 * Gaps in adjacency (e.g., <=1 empty cell) allow "near" merges, but only for specific pairs (6/7); stricter for others (e.g., exact row+1 for 4->6).
 * Colors like 2,5,9 have specific interactions (e.g., 5->9), but 2 is untreated in the code, suggesting missing rules for it (possibly absorption or separate merge).
 * Protected colors (0,3,8,9) aren't absorbed, implying they are "final" or dominant; 1 is ignored in component finding, possibly a divider or invalid.
 * Subtleties: Merging loops must iterate until no changes (while changed), but deletion during iteration risks skipping/index errors (code uses del and continues, but may miss multi-merges). Bbox overlap check includes exact overlap + adjacent with gap<=1, but only vertical/horizontal (no diagonal). Size recalc in expand_maroon assumes full rectangle fill, which may overfill non-rectangular shapes. No handling for color 2 (appears in test/gen but untreated). Global green merge ignores position, which may create oversized bboxes that override others incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical priority (e.g., below attachments change to upper color); rightmost tiebreaker for 6/7; exclusion of 0/1 from components; sorting by size in final fill (larger dominates overlaps).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed to match expected outputs, indicating core merging rules are incomplete or incorrectly prioritized (e.g., 6/7 merge exists but doesn't produce the expected 7-dominant fills in Train 1).
 * Train 1 generated scattered 6's, isolated 3, partial 4/9 merges, and expanded 8 at bottom, but expected a large 7 block with vertical 3 strip on right—missed full 6->7 propagation and green (3) placement/expansion; 4->6 merge didn't trigger or chain properly, leaving 4's visible.
 * Train 2 generated vertical 8's on left, merged 3's, but isolated 9's and no 6/7—expected horizontal 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 in middle; absorb_small didn't handle 3's correctly (over-merged?), and no 6 creation from other colors.
 * Train 3 generated partial 6/3/4 stacks and separate 8/9/5, but expected integrated 5/7/8/6/3/4 with 5 on top and 7/8 left—vertical merges (e.g., 5->9) didn't apply or chain to create 7; small 5 component not absorbed; green merge created wrong bbox.
 * Train 4 generated fragmented 6/3/2 with 0 gaps preserved, but expected solid 6/3/2 bands wrapping around—absorb_small failed on 2 (untreated color), no rule for 2->6 or similar; greens merged but not positioned to fill expected areas.
 * merge_six_and_seven is partially helpful but broken in color choice/tiebreaker (prefers wrong color, e.g., keeps 6 instead of 7); iteration deletes components but may skip multi-merges in chains.
 * handle_four_to_six and handle_five_to_nine are specific but too narrow (only vertical below, no horizontal or chaining); didn't trigger in trains where expected (e.g., Train 3's 4/5).
 * absorb_small_components skips key colors but absorbs others too aggressively or not at all (e.g., didn't absorb 2 in Train 4); gap<=1 may be too loose, causing unwanted merges.
 * merge_all_greens unions all 3's globally, which worked partially (consolidated in trains) but created oversized bboxes that overrode other areas incorrectly (e.g., Train 1's single 3 spot vs. expected strip).
 * expand_maroon only vertical expansion, assumes rectangular fill (overfills non-rects); helpful for 8 thickening but didn't match expectations (e.g., Train 3's 8 integration).
 * Overall, component finding and bbox tools are solid foundations; final fill works but size-sort causes override issues if merges don't create expected large components. Missing rules for color 2 (appears untreated, leads to fragments). Loops for iterative merging are good but inefficient/buggy with del during iteration. No handling for 1 (ignored correctly?) or propagation (e.g., merged 6+7 becoming 7 then merging further).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate understanding of the puzzle rules, as it preserves too many original colors (e.g., scattered 2's, 3's, 4's, 7's, 8's, 9's) without sufficient merging into dominant bands or blocks seen in training expectations (e.g., no large unified 7 or 6 like Train 1/2, no wrapping 6/3/2 like Train 4).
 * It shows partial vertical merges (e.g., 3's in a tall strip on left/middle, 4's on bottom-right, 2's in a block mid-bottom, 8's expanded at bottom), but leaves gaps and fragments (e.g., isolated 7's in row 1-2, small 8 intrusions); this mismatches expected patterns of full horizontal/vertical consolidation (e.g., Train 2's clean 6/7 rows, Train 3's integrated left 7/8/6).
 * 9's dominate top/left but don't absorb or transform others (e.g., no 5->9 chaining if present in input); 8 expansion happened but only vertically, creating a thick bottom band that overrides partially but leaves 4's adjacent without merge.
 * 2's form a large block but aren't absorbed/merged (untreated color), suggesting missing rule for 2 (possibly merge into adjacent like 6/7); overall, output looks like incomplete processing—too fragmented, no global green union effect visible, and size-sort fill didn't create the clean, blocky expected styles.
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exact target, but based on trains, it should simplify to fewer colors in larger regions (e.g., 9 absorbing 3's? or 7 chaining rightward); current gen seems "half-applied" rules, not fully transformed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

Basic grid dimensions utility, useful for bounds checking.

def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image segmentation and region merging, where input grids with colors (including placeholder 1s to be resolved) represent partial or noisy images of shapes or letters, and the goal is to process them into clean, expected outputs by filling ambiguities, identifying connected components, and applying color-specific merge/expansion rules to form coherent regions that match target patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are transposed at the end, so row/column orientations must account for this (e.g., what appears vertical in input may need horizontal processing post-transpose).
 * Placeholder 1s must be iteratively filled based on the most common adjacent non-1 color, propagating changes until stable; this resolves ambiguities but can over-smooth if not handled carefully.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), tracked by bounding boxes (bbox) and size; components of the same color are grouped, but merges happen across specific color pairs or conditions.
 * Specific merge rules: 4-regions adjacent below 6-regions merge into 6 (vertical adjacency check); 5-regions near (dist 1-2 rows below) 9-regions merge into 9; 3 (green) regions adjacent or overlapping with 2 merge into 2; 6 and 7 are complements (13 - color) and merge if adjacent/overlapping, preferring the larger size; all 3 (green) regions across the grid are union-merged into one large green blob regardless of connectivity.
 * Expansion rules: 8 (maroon) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, recalculating size as full bbox area (assumes solid fill); small components (<=4 cells, excluding 3/8/9) absorb into the largest adjacent component if overlapping/adjacent.
 * 9-regions absorb into adjacent 8 if smaller; final grid is filled by largest-to-smallest components to avoid overlaps, but this can overwrite if bboxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row/col +1 checks); merges modify in-place with deepcopy to avoid mutation issues, but loops must handle index shifts (e.g., del i requires i adjustment); greens (3) are special-cased for global union, ignoring connectivity; small absorptions prioritize largest neighbor; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust merges before absorb small); unmerged components retain original color but may be overwritten in final fill; 0s remain empty/background.
 * Easy-to-miss: Bbox calculations must update min/max correctly during merges; size is pixel count, not bbox area (except post-expansion for 8); counter for filling 1s uses most_common, breaking ties arbitrarily; no diagonal connectivity; potential over-merging if adjacency is too loose; transpose flips the grid, so expected outputs are post-transpose views.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * adjust_four_to_six: Too restrictive (only exact row+1 below, col overlap); misses diagonal or partial adjacencies, leading to unmerged 4s in train 3.
 * adjust_five_to_nine: Distance check (1-2 rows) is arbitrary and fails if not vertically aligned perfectly; doesn't handle horizontal offsets well.
 * adjust_three_to_two: Relies on is_adjacent_or_overlap, but in train 1, it didn't trigger enough, leaving scattered 3s.
 * merge_six_and_seven: Loop breaks on first change but uses while changed outer loop; buggy index handling (i -=1 only in one branch) causes skipped merges or infinite loops in complex cases.
 * merge_all_greens: Unions all 3s globally, which over-merges disconnected greens (e.g., train 1 expected separate 3s in top/right, but this creates one blob covering unrelated areas).
 * expand_maroon: Assumes solid rectangular fill for size post-expansion, but if 8 has holes/gaps, size overestimates; vertical-only expansion misses horizontal needs in some cases.
 * absorb_small_components: Good intent, but excludes 3/8/9 arbitrarily (why not absorb small 9s elsewhere?); sorts by size but always picks largest, ignoring color compatibility.
 * absorb_nine_to_maroon: Only if 9 smaller than 8 and adjacent; but in train 2, 9s weren't absorbed properly, leaving them separate.
 * Overall program: Order of calls (e.g., merge greens after 6/7) can conflict; no handling for color 0s or backgrounds; final fill assumes rectangular bboxes are solid, but components may not be.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of merge triggers and order.
 * Train 1: Generated scattered 7s/8s with misplaced 3/4/9; expected large vertical 3s on right/top and 7s, with 0s bottom-left. What worked: Filled 1s and found some components (e.g., large 7/8 blocks). What didn't: Failed to merge all 3s into disconnected vertical strips (global union overdid it); 4s not merged to 6 (no 6 present?); small 3 absorbed wrong; transpose may have flipped placements incorrectly. Mismatch: Generated has horizontal 3 in row 3, but expected vertical 3s; unknown why 4/9 block bottom-middle instead of 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 9s bottom-right; expected mixed 6/7/3/8/9 with specific placements (e.g., 6 left, 8 middle, 9 bottom-right). What worked: Merged some 3s into rows, detected 8/9 adjacency. What didn't: No 6/7 merging (colors not complemented properly); 9s not absorbed into 8 or expanded; 3s over-merged horizontally instead of keeping shape. Mismatch: Generated lacks 6/7 entirely, has uniform 3 rows vs. expected irregular 3/8/6/9.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal 6/3/4/8 with small 5s; expected vertical 5/3/7/8/6/4/9 patterns. What worked: Detected 6/8 blocks, some 3/4 adjacency. What didn't: 5s left as small unabsorbed (should merge?); 4s not adjusted to 6; no 7/9 handling; bbox overlaps caused overwrite to wrong colors. Mismatch: Generated has uniform rows, but expected has vertical stacks (e.g., 5 top-left, 6 middle-right); 5s appear top-right instead of left.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical 2s left/bottom with 6s middle; expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers. What worked: Merged 2s into large block bottom, some 6 detection. What didn't: No 3-to-2 merge (3s absorbed wrong or missing); 6s not expanded or positioned right; transpose flipped to vertical but expected horizontal. Mismatch: Generated 2s dominate left, but expected 2s right/bottom; 3s vanished entirely (over-absorbed?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive uniform 9 blocks top/middle/bottom with thin 6 strip middle-right, small 8 horizontal bottom, and misplaced 7/4 bottom-middle. This seems over-merged (e.g., all top/middle as 9, ignoring shapes), with no 3s/2s/5s visible and irregular 4/7 insertion bottom. Expected likely has more varied regions (e.g., vertical/horizontal bands of 6/8/9/3 like training, with merges forming letters/shapes); current output lacks structure, has unexplained 4-block in bottom-middle (unmerged?), and 8 not expanded properly. Transpose may have distorted vertical elements to horizontal. It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no global green union visible, small components not absorbed cleanly), suggesting misses in color-specific rules for this larger grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:31:25] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a noisy grid of integers (representing colors or labels, with 0 and 1 as noise) to detect and reconstruct blocky, striped regions by ignoring noise, mapping specific values, filling/expanding certain colors into zeros, and finally transposing the grid to produce a cleaned-up output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of integers 0-9, where 0 and 1 are treated as noise and ignored when computing modes (most common non-noise value in rows/columns/segments).
 * Horizontal stripes are identified by grouping consecutive rows with the same row-mode (non-noise dominant value); this assumes large uniform bands vertically.
 * Within each stripe, horizontal subdivisions are made by grouping consecutive columns with the same column-mode (computed over the stripe's rows); this creates blocky sub-regions.
 * A mapping function remaps specific values (6→7, 4→0, 8→0, 9→3, 5→9) before assigning colors to blocks, suggesting a color substitution rule to normalize or reveal hidden patterns.
 * In the reconstructed grid, block color prefers the column-mode (if non-zero after mapping) over the row-mode, but falls back to row-mode if column-mode is zero; this prioritizes vertical consistency within stripes.
 * Post-reconstruction, zeros adjacent to 3's are iteratively expanded into 3's (flood-fill like), but only for 3's—other values don't expand; this happens before transposition and can propagate changes across the grid.
 * Final transposition (rows become columns) rotates the cleaned grid 90 degrees, implying the puzzle's orientation or viewing direction changes after processing.
 * Subtleties: Mode ignores only 0/1, so other low-count values (e.g., 2-9) can influence if dominant; stripes must be exact mode matches, potentially missing subtle gradients or non-full-width blocks; expansion is directional (4-neighbors) and iterative until stable, but only affects 0's next to 3's, missing opportunities for other colors; mapping is asymmetric and doesn't handle all values (e.g., 2,3,7 unchanged), which might miss puzzle-specific substitutions; no vertical stripe detection, assuming horizontal dominance; noise might form patterns that mislead modes; grids can have varying sizes, but code assumes rectangular; post-transpose, expansion effects rotate, altering final patterns.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used horizontal stripe detection, noise-ignoring modes, value mapping, block reconstruction with column/row mode priority, 3-expansion into 0's, and final transpose, showing partial understanding of cleaning noisy blocky grids but failing all training examples due to incorrect region detection and filling.
 * Train 1: Generated large top 7-block (rows 0-7, cols 0-12) and bottom 0/7 strips, but expected a mixed 7/3 pattern with 3's expanding into a mid-block (rows 4-6 full 3's, partial in others) and 0's only at bottom-left; differences: over-filled 7's into expected 3-areas (e.g., cols 10-12 rows 0-3 should be 3 not 7), no mid-3 expansion, bottom rows all 0-left but expected 3-right and 7-right; unknown why stripe detection merged rows 0-7 as single 7-mode ignoring 3's.
 * Train 2: Generated irregular 7/3 patterns in top (e.g., row 1 has isolated 7 in col 6) and bottom 3/7/9 blocks, but expected uniform 6-left bands, 3-top-left, 8/6/9 patterned mid-right, 7-right; differences: wrong mappings/colors (e.g., generated 7/3/9 vs expected 6/3/8/9/7, suggesting map_mode mishandled inputs like 6→7 incorrectly applied), no vertical consistency, expansion didn't create expected 6/8 bands; subdivision likely broke on noise, creating jagged edges.
 * Train 3: Generated top 7/9 blocks and mid 3/7 patterns with some irregularities (e.g., row 6 col 4=7 isolated), but expected top 5/3 bands, mid 7/8/6/3/4 patterned rows; differences: top rows 0-2 cols 0-8=7 vs expected 5, right cols 9-13 mixed 9/3 vs 3/6/4, lower rows over-filled 3's ignoring 7/8/6/4 variations; stripe finder probably detected wrong modes (e.g., 5→9 mapping created false 9-stripe), no handling for non-uniform row modes within expected blocks.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2's (rows 0-6 cols 0-2), mid-right 7/3 blocks, bottom full 3's, but expected alternating 6/3/2 bands vertically; differences: top/mid 2/7/3 vs expected 6/2, bottom 3's correct but upper rows wrong (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 0-6=6 not 2/7), no alternation or vertical stripe logic—horizontal-only approach filled uniformly, missing row-varied patterns; expansion didn't apply as no 3's to expand initially.
 * Function `build_blocky_grid` is partially helpful for reconstruction but broken in practice: it creates overly uniform blocks by row-mode fallback, ignoring subtle column variations and leading to solid fills where patterns are expected; don't rely on it without fixing fallback logic.
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., bounded regions) attempted, but it might be needed for non-stripe shapes; current mode-based approach misses isolated or diagonal patterns.
 * Mapping `map_mode` seems essential but incomplete—handles some (6,4,8,9,5) but leaves others (2,3,7) unchanged, causing mismatches like 6→7 when expected 6 stays or maps differently.
 * Expansion `expand_three_into_zeros` is helpful for 3-filling but too narrow (only 3's, not other colors like expected 6/8 in Train 2); iterative nature is good but pre-transpose timing propagates wrong if blocks are misidentified.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core ideas (noise ignore, stripes, map, expand, transpose) but fails on detection accuracy, leading to wrong color assignments and no sample passing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform 3-left blocks (cols 0-9 rows 0-24), mid 7/2/3 mixed but jagged (e.g., row 6 col 10=2-start but irregular widths, row 14 col 8=2-overlap into 3's), bottom 7/3 full rows, with some 0's absent—suggests overzealous stripe merging created massive 3/7 bands, but expected output (mentally simulated) should have more varied vertical/horizontal blocks post-transpose, like expanded 3's into patterned regions (e.g., based on Train 1's 3-expansion) and correct mappings for 2/7 areas without the wide uniform fills; differences include no clear block alternation (test has long 3-strips rows 0-5 cols 0-9, but likely needs subdivided 3/7/2 patterns), expansion seems partial (some 0's missing where adjacent to 3's), and transpose may have rotated wrong noisy reconstruction; it doesn't match expected clean blocky art (e.g., potential logo/image with distinct color zones), appearing too monotonous left-side.

[2025-10-03 16:31:25] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of integers representing colors or regions, where empty or neutral cells (likely 1's) are expanded or filled based on adjacency to existing colored regions (e.g., 3 for green), followed by some transformation like transposition, to produce coherent block-like outputs that match expected region divisions. The goal is to simulate region growth or connection rules that create uniform blocks of colors without overlaps or scattered artifacts.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Regions (colored numbers like 3, 6, 7, 8, 9) appear to grow or connect orthogonally (up, down, left, right), but only under specific conditions, such as proximity to "seed" cells or boundaries, without overwriting existing colors.
 * Neutral cells (1's) seem to be placeholders that get filled by the nearest or first-adjacent non-neutral color, but the current expansion picks the first adjacent color arbitrarily, leading to incorrect propagation (e.g., ignoring dominant or multi-directional influences).
 * Green (3) has a special expansion rule: it spreads to adjacent 1's only if already next to another 3, suggesting iterative flood-fill limited to green, but this doesn't handle multi-color interactions or prevent over-expansion into other regions.
 * Transposition (swapping rows and columns) is applied at the end, implying the puzzle processes the grid in one orientation (e.g., row-major growth) but outputs in a rotated view; however, this mismatches expectations where blocks are vertically/horizontally aligned differently.
 * Boundaries and isolated regions: Outputs show large uniform blocks (e.g., full rows/columns of the same color), so expansions should respect grid edges and not leak colors across disconnected areas; subtle element: some colors like 0 may represent "empty" or background that doesn't expand.
 * Multi-step iteration is key, but the while-loop in expansions runs until no changes, which can cause over-filling if not gated by color priority (e.g., green first, then others, but others override incorrectly).
 * Diagonal adjacency is not considered (only orthogonal directions), but this might be a miss if the puzzle implies 8-way connectivity in some cases.
 * Expected outputs form strict rectangular blocks or aligned strips (e.g., entire rows of 7's transitioning to 3's then 0's), suggesting the rule is more like partitioning the grid into horizontal/vertical bands based on initial seeds, rather than free-form flood-fill.
 * 1's are not truly "empty" in all contexts; in some examples, they remain or get set to 0, indicating a distinction between fillable neutrals and backgrounds.
 * Subtle: Color priorities or dominance (e.g., higher numbers like 9 don't expand into lower ones, or vice versa) aren't handled, leading to artifacts like scattered 9's or misplaced 0's.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

                    new_g[i][j] = color
                    if new_g[i][j] != 1:
                        changed = True

    return g
```

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Simple matrix transpose; helpful for final orientation if the puzzle requires row-column swap.
    # Not broken, but application after expansions mismatches expected block alignments.
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt uses green-specific flood-fill followed by general color propagation and transpose, but all training examples fail due to incorrect region boundaries and scattered colors (e.g., Train 1 generated has misplaced 3's in row 4 and 0's in unexpected spots, while expected has clean horizontal bands of 7/3/0).
 * What worked: Basic iterative expansion captures some connectivity (e.g., in Train 2, some 3's and 8's connect partially), and transpose orients the output as a grid; also handles empty grids gracefully.
 * What didn't work: Arbitrary first-adjacent color picking in expand_other causes wrong fills (e.g., Train 1 has 6's dominating where 7's should, and 4's/9's scattered instead of blocked); green expansion doesn't propagate far enough or interacts poorly with others (Train 3 generated has fragmented 3's and 4's vs. expected vertical strips).
 * Train 1 mismatches: Generated has vertical 6's and horizontal mixes in bottom, but expected is uniform horizontal layers (7's top, 3's middle, 0's bottom); unknown why 9's appear in generated row 10.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has irregular 3's and 9's/5's in bottom, but expected has clean 6/3/8/9 bands; expansion overfills into non-adjacent areas.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated fragments 3's/4's/6's into non-rectangular shapes, expected has aligned rows of 5/3 then 7/8/6/4 blocks; transpose may be applied too late or wrongly.
 * Train 4 mismatches: Generated keeps some 2's/6's but scatters 3's irregularly, expected has horizontal 6/3/2 layers; no clear blocking rule.
 * expand_green is somewhat helpful for 3-specific growth but unhelpful without color priority; expand_other is broken for multi-color grids as it doesn't use distance or majority vote.
 * No object extraction function attempted, which might be needed to identify initial seeds or blobs before expansion.
 * Overall, attempt shows partial understanding of adjacency but misses block-forming rules and priority.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it produces a highly fragmented and irregular grid with scattered 0's, 2's, 3's, 6's, 8's, 9's in non-uniform patterns (e.g., row 13 has mixed 9's, 2's, 0's, 6's), lacking the clean rectangular blocks or bands seen in expected training outputs.
 * It over-expands colors like 9's across most of the top and bottom, but inserts random 0's and 2's in the middle (e.g., rows 4-12 have isolated 0's and small 2-clusters), which doesn't form coherent regions and ignores potential boundary constraints.
 * Bottom rows introduce 7's and 4's abruptly (e.g., row 26 has 7's where 9's dominate elsewhere), suggesting the arbitrary adjacent-fill rule fails on large grids with multiple color seeds, leading to patchy fills unlike the structured expectations.
 * No clear horizontal/vertical striping as in trainings; for example, if test input has vertical seeds, output should produce banded rows post-transpose, but instead it's chaotic—likely incorrect due to lack of expansion limits or color dominance.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (represented by integers 0-9) where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color transformation, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, position, and specific color interactions, then fill and transpose the resulting grid to match an expected output pattern. The rules seem to simulate "object" simplification or unification in a 2D spatial puzzle, possibly inspired by image segmentation or blob analysis, but with custom color-specific behaviors.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-connected (up, down, left, right) and must be of the exact same color; bounding boxes (bbox) are used to approximate regions for adjacency checks, but this can lead to over-merging if not precise (e.g., diagonal or distant touches aren't handled).
 * Small components (size <=4) of blue (1) are absorbed into adjacent non-blues, prioritizing the largest; similarly for small non-blues (size 1-4, excluding colors 3,8,9) into larger ones, but this ignores color compatibility and can swallow unintended areas.
 * Color adjustments: 4 becomes 6 if directly below a 6 (row-adjacent, column-overlap); 3 becomes 2 if adjacent or overlapping with 2; 5 becomes 9 if "near" (within 2 rows, column-overlap) a 9—these are asymmetric and position-dependent, easy to miss row/column specifics or overlap definitions.
 * Merging: Similar colors (6 and 7) merge if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller; all greens (3) are unconditionally merged into one giant component regardless of position— this can distort spatial relationships.
 * Expansion: Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, increasing size accordingly, but only vertically and without checking overlaps.
 * Filling: Components are filled into a grid by bbox (not exact shape), sorted by size (greens prioritized), skipping color 0; final transpose flips rows/columns, which is crucial but can confuse orientation.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touch (horizontal/vertical, but not diagonal); bbox merging can create rectangular approximations that overfill; no handling for isolated singles or color 0 as background; order of operations matters (e.g., absorb before merge); greens (3) seem special (merged all, prioritized in filling); no diagonal connectivity; potential for infinite loops in while loops if not careful; transposition is always applied, so inputs/outputs have swapped dimensions.
 * Overlooked: Rules may not apply universally—e.g., in training 1, greens should form a large block but code places a small 3; in training 2, 6s and 7s don't merge properly, and 8s/9s shift; color 0 appears as empty in expected but not handled; small components might not always absorb (e.g., if no adjacent large); position matters more than size sometimes (e.g., "below" or "near").
 * General: Puzzle likely tests understanding of spatial rules over strict connectivity; expected outputs show more irregular shapes (non-rectangular fills), suggesting bbox filling is too crude—need exact pixel filling or shape preservation.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python

    # Standard flood-fill BFS/DFS to find same-color connected components with bbox and size
    # Helpful for initial segmentation; directions are 4-way, visited prevents reprocessing
    # Returns list of dicts; accurate for exact connectivity but bbox approx for later steps
    h, w = len(g), len(g[0])
    visited = [[False] * w for _ in range(h)]
    components = []
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            if g[i][j] != 0 and not visited[i][j]:
                # ... (rest as in code)
    return components
```
```python
def bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # Checks overlap or edge-adjacency (horiz/vert, no diagonal); useful for merge/absorb decisions
    # But can false-positive if bboxes touch without actual cell adjacency
    r1, c1, r2, c2 = b1
    r3, c3, r4, c4 = b2
    if max(r1, r3) <= min(r2, r4) and max(c1, c3) <= min(c2, c4):
        return True
    # ... (rest as in code)
    return False
```
```python
def create_filled_grid(components: List[Dict], h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Fills grid with color by bbox, sorted by size (greens boosted); skips 0
    # Helpful for output generation but overfills non-rect shapes; priority favors large/greens
    # Transpose after to match expected orientation
```
* `find_adjacent_components`: Uses bbox overlap+1 for "adjacent"; helpful but loose (includes distant if bbox large).
* `is_below` and `is_near`: Position-specific checks; useful for rule application but hardcoded distances (1 row for below, 2 for near) may not generalize.
* Unhelpful/broken functions: `absorb_small_blues` and `absorb_small_non_blues`—they modify in place and filter out absorbed, but don't update colors/sizes accurately and ignore puzzle-specific absorptions (e.g., don't turn absorbed into absorber's color); lead to lost components. `handle_color_adjustments`—while loop with deepcopy is inefficient and deletes during iteration, risking index errors; transformations are too narrow (e.g., misses 6->something). `merge_similar_colors`—only for 6/7, asymmetric absorption; doesn't handle all cases like training 2's 6/7 split. `merge_all_greens`—unconditional global merge ignores spatial separation, causing over-unification (e.g., disconnected greens in expected). `expand_maroon_components`—vertical-only expansion adds phantom size without filling logic; doesn't check boundaries properly. Overall, these are puzzle-specific guesses that don't align with expected outputs.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is a single comprehensive attempt with multiple rule functions chained in `program`; it demonstrates understanding of connected components and bbox-based processing but fails all training due to incorrect rule assumptions.
 * Training 1: Generated large 7 blocks on left/top with misplaced small 3, bottom 4/9 blocks shifted right; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s in middle/bottom, 0s as background—code over-absorbed blues/non-blues into 7s, didn't merge greens properly into large block, expanded 8s wrongly, and 4/9 didn't transform correctly; transposition may have oriented wrong.
 * Training 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 8/9 on right; expected has 6s merging across, 8s in middle, 9s bottom-right, 7s top-right—code merged all 3s too aggressively, didn't convert/merge 6/7/8 properly, absorbed smalls into 3s instead of transforming, resulting in no 6/8/9 positions.
 * Training 3: Generated horizontal 6s top, 3/4/8 blocks middle with trailing 4s; expected has 5s top-left, vertical 3s, mixed 7/8/6/4 on sides—code didn't handle 5->9 nearness, kept 4s separate instead of below->6, expanded 8s horizontally wrongly, no 5/7 placement, greens not merged right.
 * Training 4: Generated vertical 2s left, full 6s middle, bottom 2s; expected has horizontal 6s top/bottom, vertical 3s middle, 2s right—code absorbed 2/3 into 6s wrongly, didn't preserve 3s as separate vertical, merged 2s prematurely, no 3 block formation.
 * Common issues: Bbox filling creates rectangles over irregular shapes (e.g., expected has non-full bboxes); absorption/merging too aggressive/generic, ignoring color pairs (e.g., 3+2->2, but code merges greens all); position rules (below/near) under-applied; transposition applied but inputs may need row/col swap consideration; no handling for 0 as explicit empty; size thresholds (4) arbitrary and miss cases; order (absorb -> adjust -> merge) causes cascade errors.
 * `find_connected_components` is essential and correct for extraction; others like `merge_all_greens` are overkill/unhelpful as they ignore adjacency.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a large 30-column grid (likely transposed from ~20x30 input) with massive 9 blocks on left/bottom, vertical 2s/6s in middle, small 8s bottom-right, and irregular 7/4 in bottom— but patterns are overly rectangular and uniform, suggesting bbox overfill without shape respect.
 * Issues: Huge 9s dominate left (rows 0-30 cols 0-1, scattered elsewhere), but expected likely has more mixed/spatial merges (e.g., 2s absorbed into 9s?); 6s form tall vertical strip (cols 14-26), but training patterns suggest horizontal/oriented merges; 8s are small clustered bottom-right, but expansion rule may overgrow them; 4s appear as block in bottom-middle without transformation (e.g., to 6 if below); 7s small top-bottom left; overall, lacks subtlety like near-merges or color shifts seen in training expecteds (e.g., no visible 3/5 handling, potential 0 empties missing).
 * Doesn't match expected logic: Based on training, test should show merged greens (3) if present, positioned transformations (e.g., 4 below 6), and non-rect fills; instead, it's blob-like with wrong colors (e.g., persistent 2s/4s not absorbed/transformed); transposition may hide input orientation issues. Unknown why 9s are so pervasive—possibly over-absorption of smalls into 9s—but it disrupts balance seen in expecteds.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This appears to be a visual puzzle involving the processing of 2D grids of integers (likely representing colored pixels or regions) to transform noisy or patterned inputs into cleaner, structured outputs that reveal shapes, fill regions, or apply geometric rules like symmetry, connectivity, or boundary detection. The goal is to produce exact matches to expected grids, which seem to emphasize uniform region filling, edge preservation, and possibly object extraction or pattern completion across varying grid sizes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent visual elements like shapes or blobs of colors (integers 0-9), and transformations must preserve overall structure while cleaning noise, such as isolated pixels or irregular boundaries, without over-smoothing large regions.
 * Expected outputs often show sharp, rectangular or stepped region boundaries (e.g., solid blocks of the same number), suggesting rules for flood-filling connected components or propagating colors based on majority in neighborhoods, but with constraints on directionality or adjacency.
 * Subtle elements include handling non-square grids (e.g., training example 2 is 10x10 but output varies in pattern density), maintaining aspect ratios after any rotation/transposition, and avoiding propagation across disconnected regions—e.g., in training 1, expected has distinct horizontal bands of 7,3,0 without vertical bleed.
 * Connectivity is 4-way (up/down/left/right) rather than 8-way, as diagonal fills are not evident in expectations; noise like single pixels (e.g., potential 1s or 2s in inputs) should be absorbed into dominant neighbors but not spread indefinitely.
 * Patterns may involve symmetry or mirroring (e.g., training 4 expected has repeating rows), and color propagation seems biased toward lower rows/columns in some cases, possibly indicating gravity-like settling or top-down filling.
 * Easy-to-miss: Outputs must exactly match row-by-row, including trailing same-color extensions (e.g., training 1 ends with consistent 7s); over-smoothing can merge unrelated regions (seen in generated outputs with excessive 6/7/8 blending).
 * Across attempts, consider irregular shapes like Ls, Ts, or irregular blobs—rules likely involve bounding boxes or contour following to straighten edges.
 * Grid dimensions vary (e.g., 12x16 in training 1, 10x10 in 2 and 4, 9x14 in 3), so functions must be dimension-agnostic; inputs may have noise levels that require iterative but limited passes to avoid total homogenization.
 * Potential rules: Identify "objects" as connected components of the same color, then expand/contract them to fit expected clean shapes; or apply morphological operations like dilation/erosion before filling.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used transposition followed by iterative majority-vote smoothing (3x3 neighborhood), which partially denoises small noise but fails to produce structured region fills, leading to all training examples incorrect.
 * What worked: Smoothing correctly absorbs some isolated noise (e.g., in training 1, it consolidated lower regions into 4s and 7s, reducing scattered values), and transposition handles orientation swaps, which might be relevant if puzzles involve rotation.
 * What didn't work: Over-smoothing merged distinct regions (e.g., in training 1, generated has gradual gradients of 6->7->8->4 instead of sharp 7/3/0 bands; expected has clear horizontal separation not achieved). In training 2, it failed to isolate small features like 1s or create the expected stepped pattern with 6/8/9. Training 3 generated irregular fills (e.g., partial 3/4/8 blobs) missing the expected clean rows and columns. Training 4 preserved some repetition but incorrectly propagated 2/3/6 without matching the alternating row structure.
 * Transposition alone is unhelpful or broken for these cases, as inputs/outputs don't show consistent row-column swaps (e.g., training 1 expected keeps horizontal bands post-any transform).
 * Majority smoothing function is somewhat helpful for noise reduction but not for the puzzle, as it lacks color-specific rules or connectivity—leads to diffusion rather than precise filling (e.g., in training 1, 6s dominate top where 7s expected).
 * No object extraction was used, missing key for identifying and cleaning blobs; generated outputs show blended colors (e.g., 6/7/8 in training 1) instead of expected pure zones.
 * Iterative smoothing (3 passes) exacerbated blending without boundaries, causing mismatches like training 2's generated 7/8/3/1/5 mess vs. expected clean 6/3/8/9 blocks.
 * extract_objects-like function absent, so no handling of multiple components; this is essential for puzzles with separate regions (e.g., training 3's multiple 3/4/6/8 groups).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it's a highly irregular, noisy grid with scattered 0/2/3/6/7/8/9 values forming no clear shapes or uniform regions, suggesting over-smoothed chaos rather than structured output (e.g., rows 14-15 have mixed 2/6/9, while earlier rows blend 0/3/6/9 without boundaries).
 * It differs from what we'd expect based on training patterns: likely clean, blocky regions (e.g., large 9 areas with inset 3/6/0/2 shapes, similar to training 1's bands), but generated has jagged edges and unexplained intrusions (e.g., isolated 7s in row 25, 4s in rows 26-29) that don't form expected symmetries or fills—possibly the smoothing propagated noise incorrectly without connectivity rules.
 * No clear propagation or filling observed (e.g., bottom-right 4/8 block looks partial and unmatched to training's uniform ends); this indicates the approach fails on larger, more complex grids with multiple interacting regions.
 * To handle test case, need rules for hierarchical filling (e.g., largest components first) or boundary detection to prevent bleed, as current output homogenizes too much without preserving subtle separations seen in training expectations.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual denoising puzzle where the input grid contains numbers representing colors or patterns, with 0 and 1 acting as noise or background/foreground artifacts, and the goal is to reconstruct a cleaner, blocky version by identifying large uniform rectangular regions (stripes or blocks) and filling them with the dominant (mode) value while ignoring noise. The output should consist of large, consistent horizontal and vertical blocks of the same number, smoothing out irregularities to reveal an underlying structured pattern.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids have noise (0 and 1) that should be ignored when computing modes or dominant values in rows, columns, or segments; never treat 0 or 1 as valid pattern values unless they form a dominant block themselves (which is rare).
 * Identify vertical stripes first by scanning columns and grouping consecutive columns with the same mode (ignoring noise), then subdivide those stripes horizontally into sub-blocks with uniform row modes.
 * Sub-blocks should be rectangular and as large as possible; small anomalies (e.g., isolated 0s, 1s, or minority values) should be overridden by the surrounding dominant value, but consistent minority patterns might indicate separate sub-blocks.
 * Horizontal symmetry or repetition in expected outputs suggests checking for repeated rows or patterns across the grid; vertical stripes may not span the full height, so subdivide vertically within each stripe.
 * Anomalies should be detected but not propagated—use them only to refine boundaries, not to fill the output; top anomalies (e.g., via Counter) can help identify if a block needs splitting but aren't directly used for filling.
 * Transposing the grid (as in the current program) scrambles the structure and doesn't align with blocky expected outputs, which preserve row/column orientations.
 * Edge cases: Empty grids return empty; single-column or single-row grids should mode the entire thing ignoring noise; blocks may abut without separators, and noise can form thin lines or spots that must be smoothed over.
 * Subtle elements: Dominant value in a segment is the most common non-0/1 number; if no non-noise values, default to 0; outputs are always the same dimensions as input; patterns may shift midway (e.g., a vertical stripe changing mode partway down), requiring vertical subdivision.
 * Across attempts, noise often leaks into outputs (e.g., scattered 1s and 0s remain), and blocks aren't fully filled—e.g., in Train 1, generated has irregular 6s/7s/8s with noise, but expected has clean 7/3/0 blocks; ensure filling propagates the mode across the entire detected block.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed because the main program only transposes the grid (via zip(*g)), which rotates it 90 degrees and preserves noise without any denoising or block-filling, leading to scrambled, noisy outputs that don't match the clean, blocky expected grids.
 * Train 1 generated: Mostly 6s/7s/8s with scattered 1s/0s and irregular shapes (e.g., row 0 has ten 6s then 7s/8s; row 3 has a 3 in noise); expected: Clean horizontal blocks of 7s (rows 0-3), 3s (rows 4-6), 0s (rows 7-11) with vertical shifts at columns 10-12—generated mismatches by not filling full blocks and leaking noise (e.g., 1s in expected 7/3 areas).
 * Train 2 generated: Jumbled 7s/8s/3s with heavy noise (e.g., row 1 has 7s then 8s/1s; row 6 has 1s/9s/5s); expected: Top 3 rows full 6s ending in 7s, then 3/8/6/7 blocks with a bottom 3/8/9/7 pattern—generated fails to group into large blocks, keeps 1s/6s as noise instead of smoothing to dominants like 6/7/8/9.
 * Train 3 generated: Messy 6s/5s/9s/3s/4s/8s with 1s scattered (e.g., row 1 has 1s in middle; row 7 has 1s/7); expected: Top 3 rows 5s then 3s, middle 7/8/6/3 blocks, bottom 7/8/6/4—generated doesn't detect vertical/horizontal subdivisions properly, resulting in partial fills and noise retention (unknown why 5s appear where 3s expected, possibly from miscomputed modes).
 * Train 4 generated: Irregular 2s/6s/3s with 1s (e.g., row 0 has 2s/6s/1; row 7 has 3s/1s); expected: Top 3 and bottom 3 rows full 6s/2s, middle 7 rows 3s/2s—generated fails to smooth vertical columns into blocks, keeps noise like 1s in 6/3 areas.
 * The stripe-finding and subdivision functions are sketched but unused in the main program, so they don't impact outputs; anomaly detection is helpful for refinement but overkill if not integrated into filling.
 * Transposing is broken and unhelpful— it changes the grid orientation without denoising, worsening matches (don't use in future).
 * No attempts passed, showing incomplete integration of denoising logic; core issue is lack of a full reconstruction step to create a new grid by filling detected blocks with their modes.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it remains highly noisy and irregular, with scattered 0s/1s/2s/3s/6s/8s/9s across rows (e.g., row 0 has 14 9s then 14 6s; row 12 has mixed 9s/3s/0s/1s/6s; row 24 has 9s/7s/1s), forming no clear large blocks, whereas a correct output should have smooth, rectangular regions of uniform numbers (e.g., large 9/3/6/2/8/4/7 blocks based on apparent patterns in the input).
 * It appears to be a slightly modified version of the input (possibly transposed or partially processed), but noise persists heavily (e.g., isolated 1s in row 13, 0s in row 14), and structures like potential vertical 9-stripe on left or 6-stripe in middle aren't fully filled or subdivided horizontally.
 * Bottom rows show some blockiness (e.g., row 25 has 9/7s/1s/4s/9s/8s), but it's inconsistent and doesn't align with expected denoising—likely failed because the program doesn't apply stripe/subdivision logic to build a new clean grid.
 * Overall, it makes no sense as a solution; it looks like raw input with minor artifacts rather than a reconstructed puzzle, missing the block-filling to handle test's complex noise (e.g., diagonal-ish 0/1 lines and small 2/8 intrusions that should be smoothed).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that appears to involve simplifying a noisy or detailed grid of colored cells (numbers representing colors, with 0 as background/empty and 1 as holes) into a cleaner, blocky representation of larger rectangular regions dominated by a single color per block, likely by identifying and expanding dominant color modes while ignoring or filling insignificant elements like isolated cells or noise.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids represent images with colors (integers 2+), 0s as empty space to ignore in mode calculations, and 1s as "holes" that need filling with nearby colors, but filling must preserve overall block structures rather than blending everything.
 * Dominant colors in columns or rows should form "stripes" or sub-blocks, but the process must handle irregular shapes: vertical/horizontal grouping should be based on modes of non-0 cells, yet avoid over-generalizing across breaks in patterns (e.g., don't merge columns with the same mode if interrupted by different dominant regions).
 * Transposition (rotating the grid) is applied at the end, suggesting the simplification might need to work in a specific orientation (e.g., vertical stripes first, then horizontal subdivision), but this can distort results if the initial direction is wrong—subtleties include checking if horizontal stripes or no transpose would better match expected blocky outputs.
 * 0s in expected outputs indicate preserved empty space, so the simplification should not fill everything; blocks should only expand to cover areas where a color truly dominates, leaving gaps as 0.
 * Subtle elements: Modes must ignore 0s but not overcount minorities; BFS for hole-filling works for proximity but fails if it propagates wrong colors across boundaries (e.g., in training 1, it seems to flood 6s and 7s incorrectly into areas that should be 3s or 0s). Patterns often have asymmetric blocks (e.g., L-shapes or offsets), so rigid rectangular subdivision misses curves or steps. Expected outputs show crisp, uniform blocks without noise, implying a need to detect and uniformize regions beyond simple modes—consider connected components or flood-fill for true blobs rather than column/row modes.
 * Across attempts, no handling for multi-color transitions within stripes (e.g., training 2 has mixed 3,6,8 but generated merges wrongly); also, widths/heights of blocks must match exactly (e.g., training 3 generated irregular 4s and 6s where expected has clean horizontal bands).
 * General: Grids vary in size (e.g., 12x16, 10x10, 9x14, 10x10), so solutions must be general; test input is larger (28x30?), with complex nested patterns including 0s as separators.

                grid[nx][ny] = color
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                q.append((nx, ny, color))
    return grid
```
(This BFS hole-filling is helpful for proximity-based completion but needs refinement to avoid over-propagation across block boundaries; useful as a preprocessing step.)

```python
def compute_mode(lst: List[int]) -> int:
    """Compute mode ignoring 0."""
    count = Counter(x for x in lst if x != 0)
    if not count:
        return 0
    return max(count, key=count.get)
```
(This mode function is core and helpful for identifying dominant colors in rows/columns/segments, ignoring 0s correctly; should be retained and possibly extended to weighted or thresholded modes.)

```python
def transpose(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Transpose the grid."""
    if not g or not g[0]:
        return []
    return [list(row) for row in zip(*g)]
```
(Transposition is helpful for reorienting if the puzzle requires processing in rows vs. columns, but in this attempt it's applied too late or wrongly, leading to mismatches; consider applying earlier or conditionally.)

(Note: No explicit object extraction function was in this attempt, but one could be added for blob detection via flood-fill to identify connected components of same color, which might better capture non-rectangular blocks before rectangular approximation.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples by producing over-smoothed or misaligned blocky grids: e.g., in Train 1, generated uniform horizontal bands of 6/7/4/9 (ignoring expected vertical shifts to 3s and bottom 0s), likely due to vertical stripe grouping propagating modes across row changes incorrectly.
 * Train 2: Generated merged 7s and 3s into incorrect positions (e.g., top 7s where expected has 6s, and scattered 5s at bottom), missing the expected stepped pattern with 8/6/9 transitions—subdivision didn't capture horizontal offsets.
 * Train 3: Generated repetitive 6/3/4/8 patterns with irregularities (e.g., isolated 5/9 intrusions), while expected has clean horizontal stripes (5/3 then 7/8/6/4 bands); mode computation in sub-blocks failed to uniformize vertical variations.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical stacks of 2/6/4/3 but with inconsistent widths (e.g., 2s not spanning full expected height), missing the expected alternating 6/3/2 bands—stripe finding didn't handle row-mode changes properly within columns.
 * Overall, what worked: Hole-filling via BFS correctly propagates colors locally (no unfilled 1s in outputs), and mode computation ignores 0s appropriately; vertical stripe detection groups similar columns somewhat (e.g., right-side consistencies in Train 1).
 * What didn't work: Build_blocky_grid overfills rectangles without respecting pattern breaks (e.g., creates solid blocks where expected has 0 gaps or color shifts); transpose at end rotates results wrongly, e.g., Train 1 expected is vertical bands but generated looks horizontal post-transpose. Subdivision is too rigid, missing subtle mode changes. No handling for 0 preservation in output. Function find_vertical_stripes is somewhat helpful but broken for non-uniform heights; subdivide_stripe_vertically is unhelpful as it recomputes modes per row-segment without considering full-block connectivity (leads to fragmentation). No object extraction, which might be needed for true block identification—consider adding flood-fill for blobs.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: It produces a highly uniform, overfilled grid dominated by 9s, 3s, 6s, and 2s in large rectangular bands (e.g., top-heavy 9s, vertical 3/6 stripes, scattered 8s/4s/7s at bottom), but ignores the input's complex structure with 0-separated regions, offsets, and mixed colors (e.g., input has clustered 2s, isolated 0s as dividers, and diagonal-ish transitions around rows 7-22). This results in loss of detail like the input's bottom-right 8s block and mid-grid 2s cluster, replaced by smoothed modes; expected should likely preserve more stepped/offset blocks (e.g., expanding 9s only where dominant, leaving 0 gaps, and uniformizing 2s/6s without bleeding). It doesn't make sense as a simplification because it merges unrelated areas (e.g., top 9s flood into mid-3s), suggesting the vertical-first approach and hole-filling propagate too aggressively without boundary detection.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving processing a grid of integer cells (0-9 representing colors or shapes) to simulate object recognition and merging rules, such as filling internal holes with priority-based propagation, identifying connected components of the same color, merging or removing components based on adjacency, position, and color-specific rules (e.g., attaching small shapes to larger ones), and finally reconstructing and transposing the grid to match an expected layout that represents assembled or corrected puzzle pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The grid starts with 1s as "holes" to be filled via a priority queue-based flood fill from non-1 cells, where priorities (e.g., {0:0, 2:2, 3:10, 4:3, 5:6, 6:5, 7:8, 8:7, 9:9}) determine which color propagates farthest or ties are broken, favoring higher-priority colors for holes.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent cells of the same color (non-zero), tracked with bounding boxes (min/max row/col) and size; 0s are background/empty.
 * Merging rules are color- and position-specific: e.g., attach 4 (orange?) directly below 6 (purple?) by expanding bbox and adding size; merge 3 (green) into adjacent 2 (red) if bboxes overlap or touch horizontally/vertically/diagonally (via custom adjacent_or_overlap check); attach 5 (yellow?) to 9 (pink?) if within 1-2 rows above and ccols overlap; remove isolated 4s near 9s; merge 6 and 8 (gray?) into adjacent 7 (blue) by expanding bbox; merge all 3s (greens) into a single component with union bbox; absorb small (<=4 size) non-blue/non-green/non-7/8/9 components into the largest adjacent one.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve or expand bboxes accurately for final filling; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust 4-to-6 before removing 4s near 9s); adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row+1 or col+1); final grid is filled by largest components first (size-descending) within their bboxes, overwriting smaller ones; always transpose at end (rows become cols); 0s remain unfilled unless propagated to; small components might be noise to absorb; blues (7) seem central/absorbing; greens (3) are special-cased to merge globally.
 * Edge cases: Grids may have varying sizes; components might not touch but be positionally related (e.g., vertical stacking); priorities ensure e.g., 3 (high pri 10) fills aggressively over lower ones like 4 (pri 3); disconnected same-color parts stay separate unless explicitly merged; no diagonal connectivity in components; background 0s don't propagate.
 * All training examples failed, suggesting over-merging (e.g., everything to 7s), incorrect adjacency (e.g., missing vertical merges), wrong filling priorities, or bbox expansion errors leading to uniform grids; transposition might be applied correctly but on wrong base grid.

(The various adjust/merge functions like adjust_four_to_six, adjust_three_to_two, etc., are helpful scaffolds for rule-specific logic but are incomplete/buggy in execution order or conditions, leading to over-merging; e.g., adjust_five_to_nine checks r1 > r4 and r1 <= r4+2 for vertical proximity. create_filled_grid is useful for reconstructing but overwrites via size-order, which may cause loss of details. transpose is correct and essential.)

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed due to incorrect merging and filling, resulting in over-simplification (e.g., uniform colors) or misplaced components.
 * Train 1: Generated mostly 7s with small 3-block in center-left and 9-block bottom-left; expected vertical 3s on right (rows 0-3,11-12?), horizontal 3s bottom (rows 4-6), and 0s in bottom-left (rows 7-11); difference: failed to propagate/absorb correctly, greens not merged/positioned right, no 0s preserved, unknown why 7s dominated (perhaps priority 8 too high or wrong bbox expansion).
 * Train 2: Generated horizontal 3s (rows 2-4,8-9) and mixed 9s/7s bottom-right; expected 6s top/mid-left, 3s left, 8s mid, 9s bottom-right with 7s right; difference: no 6/8 creation, 3s not confined left, 9s over-expanded, 7s misplaced (e.g., single 7s inside); suggests merge_six_into_seven and merge_eight_into_seven not triggering or wrong adjacency.
 * Train 3: Generated 3-block left-mid, 7s mid, 9s top-right, isolated 5/4 right; expected 5s top-left, 3s mid-right, 7/8/6 mid, 4s bottom-right; difference: 5 not merged to anything, 4 not removed/attached, 6/8 not formed/merged to 7, 3s wrong position; unknown why 9s propagated up, but bbox overlap likely failed for vertical stacks.
 * Train 4: Generated entire grid as 2s (total overwrite); expected 6s top/bottom, 3s mid-left, 2s right; difference: everything absorbed into 2s via absorb_small_non_blues or wrong filling, no distinction of 6/3; highlights over-aggressive absorption (threshold=4 too low?) or missing specific merges for 6/3.
 * fill_holes works partially (fills 1s) but priorities cause wrong color dominance (e.g., 7 over everything).
 * find_connected_components is solid for extraction but assumes post-fill grid.
 * Merging functions (e.g., adjust_three_to_two) are helpful but buggy: e.g., global merge_all_greens too broad, causing loss in Train 1; remove_four_near_nine deletes too much/little.
 * bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap misses gap-tolerant rules (e.g., for 5-to-9).
 * create_filled_grid overwrites small details due to size-sorting.
 * No functions for input parsing or validation; unhelpful as is.
 * Overall, attempts show understanding of components/merging but fail on rule precision, order, and propagation.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive 9-blocks dominating top/mid (rows 0-14,19-24? with minor 8s in row5-7 col8 and row15-24 col22-29), a vertical 6-strip mid-right (cols14-26 rows0-14), and small 7-block bottom-left (rows25-27 cols1-4); this seems like over-propagation of 9s (high pri 9) filling most space, with 6s/8s/7s as remnants, but lacks diversity/variety expected in puzzles (e.g., no 3s/greens merged, possible 0s missing, 8s not fully merged to 7). It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no balanced 6/7/3/2 like Train 4/2), suggesting same issues: wrong priorities causing 9-flood, incomplete merges (e.g., 7s small/not absorbing), and bbox filling overwriting subtly; mentally, if test input has scattered shapes, output should have merged clusters (e.g., greens global, smalls to blues) with preserved empties, not 9-monolith—likely incorrect due to unhandled vertical/horizontal specifics or absorption threshold.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored cells (represented by numbers 0-9, where 0 is likely empty/background), where the goal is to identify connected components of the same color, apply specific merging, transformation, absorption, or expansion rules based on color, position, adjacency, and size, and then refill the grid with the resulting dominant colors to match an expected simplified or transformed pattern. The rules appear to simulate object recognition or flood-filling in a puzzle like Nonogram or region-merging, but with color-specific interactions that propagate changes (e.g., one color influencing another based on vertical/horizontal proximity).

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), excluding 0 (background) and 1 (possibly a special case like walls or ignored); bounding boxes (bbox) track min/max rows/columns for efficient overlap checks.
 * Merging is directional and conditional: e.g., color 4 directly below (row+1) a 6 with column overlap merges into the 6 (changing 4 to 6); color 5 below (dist 1 or 2 rows) a 9 merges into 9. These suggest vertical stacking rules, possibly for "attaching" base to top in puzzle objects.
 * 6 and 7 merge if adjacent or overlapping (with gap <=1 row/col), prioritizing larger size or rightmost (max column) for the target, and using the rightmost's color if tied— this implies horizontal/vertical chaining for similar colors, but the color choice (e.g., preferring 7 over 6) is critical and may need adjustment based on right-to-left or other priority.
 * Small components (<=4 cells, excluding protected colors 0,3,8,9) get absorbed into the largest adjacent component (gap <=1), expanding the target's bbox and size—this handles "noise" or minor protrusions but skips key colors like green (3) or maroon (8), suggesting 3 and 8 are "special" or structural.
 * All green (3) components merge into a single union bbox regardless of adjacency, preserving color 3—this implies greens represent a global feature (e.g., grass or background fill) that consolidates across the grid.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down (clamped to grid edges), recalculating size as full bbox area—this suggests 8 is a "border" or "foundation" that thickens, but ignores horizontal expansion and assumes rectangular fill.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size descending and overwrites with color in bbox order, which can cause larger components to override smaller ones in overlaps—subtle issue if bboxes overlap post-merge, as it may not handle partial fills or priorities correctly.
 * Gaps in adjacency (e.g., <=1 empty cell) allow "near" merges, but only for specific pairs (6/7); stricter for others (e.g., exact row+1 for 4->6).
 * Colors like 2,5,9 have specific interactions (e.g., 5->9), but 2 is untreated in the code, suggesting missing rules for it (possibly absorption or separate merge).
 * Protected colors (0,3,8,9) aren't absorbed, implying they are "final" or dominant; 1 is ignored in component finding, possibly a divider or invalid.
 * Subtleties: Merging loops must iterate until no changes (while changed), but deletion during iteration risks skipping/index errors (code uses del and continues, but may miss multi-merges). Bbox overlap check includes exact overlap + adjacent with gap<=1, but only vertical/horizontal (no diagonal). Size recalc in expand_maroon assumes full rectangle fill, which may overfill non-rectangular shapes. No handling for color 2 (appears in test/gen but untreated). Global green merge ignores position, which may create oversized bboxes that override others incorrectly.
 * Easy to miss: Vertical priority (e.g., below attachments change to upper color); rightmost tiebreaker for 6/7; exclusion of 0/1 from components; sorting by size in final fill (larger dominates overlaps).

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * All training examples failed to match expected outputs, indicating core merging rules are incomplete or incorrectly prioritized (e.g., 6/7 merge exists but doesn't produce the expected 7-dominant fills in Train 1).
 * Train 1 generated scattered 6's, isolated 3, partial 4/9 merges, and expanded 8 at bottom, but expected a large 7 block with vertical 3 strip on right—missed full 6->7 propagation and green (3) placement/expansion; 4->6 merge didn't trigger or chain properly, leaving 4's visible.
 * Train 2 generated vertical 8's on left, merged 3's, but isolated 9's and no 6/7—expected horizontal 6/7 bands with 3/8/9 in middle; absorb_small didn't handle 3's correctly (over-merged?), and no 6 creation from other colors.
 * Train 3 generated partial 6/3/4 stacks and separate 8/9/5, but expected integrated 5/7/8/6/3/4 with 5 on top and 7/8 left—vertical merges (e.g., 5->9) didn't apply or chain to create 7; small 5 component not absorbed; green merge created wrong bbox.
 * Train 4 generated fragmented 6/3/2 with 0 gaps preserved, but expected solid 6/3/2 bands wrapping around—absorb_small failed on 2 (untreated color), no rule for 2->6 or similar; greens merged but not positioned to fill expected areas.
 * merge_six_and_seven is partially helpful but broken in color choice/tiebreaker (prefers wrong color, e.g., keeps 6 instead of 7); iteration deletes components but may skip multi-merges in chains.
 * handle_four_to_six and handle_five_to_nine are specific but too narrow (only vertical below, no horizontal or chaining); didn't trigger in trains where expected (e.g., Train 3's 4/5).
 * absorb_small_components skips key colors but absorbs others too aggressively or not at all (e.g., didn't absorb 2 in Train 4); gap<=1 may be too loose, causing unwanted merges.
 * merge_all_greens unions all 3's globally, which worked partially (consolidated in trains) but created oversized bboxes that overrode other areas incorrectly (e.g., Train 1's single 3 spot vs. expected strip).
 * expand_maroon only vertical expansion, assumes rectangular fill (overfills non-rects); helpful for 8 thickening but didn't match expectations (e.g., Train 3's 8 integration).
 * Overall, component finding and bbox tools are solid foundations; final fill works but size-sort causes override issues if merges don't create expected large components. Missing rules for color 2 (appears untreated, leads to fragments). Loops for iterative merging are good but inefficient/buggy with del during iteration. No handling for 1 (ignored correctly?) or propagation (e.g., merged 6+7 becoming 7 then merging further).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and fails to demonstrate understanding of the puzzle rules, as it preserves too many original colors (e.g., scattered 2's, 3's, 4's, 7's, 8's, 9's) without sufficient merging into dominant bands or blocks seen in training expectations (e.g., no large unified 7 or 6 like Train 1/2, no wrapping 6/3/2 like Train 4).
 * It shows partial vertical merges (e.g., 3's in a tall strip on left/middle, 4's on bottom-right, 2's in a block mid-bottom, 8's expanded at bottom), but leaves gaps and fragments (e.g., isolated 7's in row 1-2, small 8 intrusions); this mismatches expected patterns of full horizontal/vertical consolidation (e.g., Train 2's clean 6/7 rows, Train 3's integrated left 7/8/6).
 * 9's dominate top/left but don't absorb or transform others (e.g., no 5->9 chaining if present in input); 8 expansion happened but only vertically, creating a thick bottom band that overrides partially but leaves 4's adjacent without merge.
 * 2's form a large block but aren't absorbed/merged (untreated color), suggesting missing rule for 2 (possibly merge into adjacent like 6/7); overall, output looks like incomplete processing—too fragmented, no global green union effect visible, and size-sort fill didn't create the clean, blocky expected styles.
 * Without expected test output, it's unclear exact target, but based on trains, it should simplify to fewer colors in larger regions (e.g., 9 absorbing 3's? or 7 chaining rightward); current gen seems "half-applied" rules, not fully transformed.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 3/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of integer values representing colored regions (e.g., 0=background, 1=blue, 3=green, 6=pink, 7=dark red, 8=maroon, 9=some large background or wall color), where the goal is to apply a series of transformation rules to merge, absorb, expand, or fill connected components based on color-specific behaviors, then transpose the resulting grid to produce a cleaned-up or stylized version that matches the expected output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Core rules inferred from the code include: (1) Absorb small blue (1) components (<=4 cells, thin shape) into overlapping large non-blue components (>20 cells, extended bbox); (2) Merge all green (3) components by unioning their bounding boxes and filling the entire area with 3; (3) Merge pink (6) and dark red (7) components if their bboxes overlap or are adjacent (horizontally/vertically), assigning the color of the larger one to the smaller; (4) Expand maroon (8) components vertically by 1 row in both directions within their column range; (5) Fill "holes" in large (>20 cells) components by overwriting their entire bbox with the component's color; (6) Finally, transpose the grid (swap rows/columns) as a post-processing step.
 * Subtleties: Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), but blues are processed separately from non-blues to allow selective absorption. Bbox-based operations (overlap, adjacency) are used for efficiency but can overfill or connect unintended areas if not precise (e.g., adjacency checks only horizontal/vertical edges, not diagonals). Large component thresholds (>20 cells) prevent small artifacts from being filled/expanded. Greens are treated as a special case for global merging, potentially ignoring other colors in the union bbox. The transpose is always applied last, suggesting the puzzle's "view" or orientation needs flipping to match expectations. Easy-to-miss: Rules may need ordering (e.g., absorb blues before merging greens to avoid overwriting), and some colors like 0 (background), 2, 4, 5, 9 may be passive or require no-op handling. Outputs show irregular shapes, so rules must preserve or create specific patterns (e.g., not fully rectangular fills). Consider color priorities (e.g., 9 as a dominant background that shouldn't be overwritten easily). All training examples failed, indicating rules are incomplete or misapplied (e.g., over-merging, wrong thresholds, ignoring specific adjacencies).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict

def get_size(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not grid:
        return 0, 0
    h = len(grid)
    w = len(grid[0]) if h > 0 else 0
    return h, w
```
Basic grid dimensions utility, useful for bounds checking.

```python
def find_connected_components(grid: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[List[Dict], List[Dict]]:
    # (Full implementation as in the program: BFS to find non-blue components and separately blue components)
    # Returns two lists: non-blue components and blue components, each as dicts with 'color', 'positions', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core function for extracting connected components (blobs) by color using BFS; separates blues for targeted rules. Essential for identifying regions to merge/absorb. Keep and refine for future attempts.

```python
def bboxes_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks if bboxes intersect)
```
Simple bbox intersection check; helpful for overlap-based rules like absorption or merging.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (Full implementation: checks horizontal or vertical edge adjacency with partial row/col overlap)
```
BBox adjacency detection for rules like pink/darkred merging; useful but may need diagonal or stricter checks if failures persist.

```python
def transpose_grid(grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (Full implementation: swaps rows and columns)
```
Basic transpose; seems correctly implemented and necessary as a final step, since all expectations involve reoriented grids.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This single attempt (the provided program) failed all 4 training examples, showing partial understanding of component-based processing but incorrect rule application, thresholds, or ordering.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with 4/7/8 bottom, but expected has layered 7/3/0 with a green strip protruding rightward and 0 background at bottom; differences include over-filling with 7/8 instead of preserving 3/0 separation, no protrusion for 3, and wrong bottom colors (4 vs 0/3). Unknown why 4 appeared—possibly unhandled color or bbox fill error. Transpose may have oriented it wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated left 7/8 strips over full-height 3 block, but expected has horizontal layers of 6/3/8/9 with specific right-side 7/6/8/9 patterns; differences include complete 3 overwrite of middle, no 6/9 distinction, and missing irregular shapes like the 8/9 bottom-right. Merge_greens overfilled entirely, ignoring other colors.
 * Train 3: Generated left-heavy 6/3/4/8 with scattered 5/9, but expected has vertical stacks of 5/3/7-8-6-4 with a 6 expansion in lower middle; differences include no 5 left strip, fragmented 9/5 instead of solid 3/6, and 4 not extended rightward. Absorption or expansion rules failed to create the expected vertical/horizontal distinctions.
 * Train 4: Generated irregular 2/6/1/3/4 mess in top with solid 3 bottom, but expected has clean horizontal 6/3 layers with 2 right strip wrapping around; differences include scattered 1/2/4 instead of unified 6/3, no wraparound 2, and 3 not split into top/bottom bands. Blues (1) not absorbed properly, leading to fragmentation.
 * Overall: Component extraction works (find_connected_components is solid), but rules like merge_greens and fill_holes over-aggressively fill bboxes, destroying shapes; absorb_small_blues and merge_pink_darkred miss cases (e.g., no handling for 2,4,5,9); expand_maroon is too narrow (only vertical, no horizontal); transpose is applied but outputs still mismatch orientations. Unhelpful: No functions for color-specific priorities or iterative rule application; get_size is trivial but okay. The program assumes fixed thresholds (e.g., size>20) that don't fit all examples.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows a massive 9-filled left/middle with a thin 6 strip, scattered 0/2 in a central band, and bottom 4/8/9 layers, creating a blocky, overfilled structure that lacks nuance. It appears to have over-applied fills (e.g., huge 9 bboxes swallowing everything left, 8 expanded bottom-wide but not shaped), with 0/2 as remnants of unabsorbed small components, and 4/6 not merged properly into expected patterns. This doesn't match puzzle subtlety (e.g., no clear green merging or pink/darkred adjacency), and the transpose results in awkward vertical stacks instead of balanced regions—likely wrong because it ignores color interactions like 9 as background barrier or 2 as a connector. Without the actual test input grid, it's hard to verify exactly, but the output's uniformity suggests rule overreach, similar to training failures (e.g., missing irregular protrusions or layered colors).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based images represented by integer color values (e.g., 1 for blue, 2 for red, 3 for green, etc.), where the goal is to process connected components of the same color, apply merging, absorption, color adjustment, and expansion rules based on size, adjacency, and relative positions, then fill bounding boxes to create a simplified or transformed grid, and finally transpose it for output.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up, down, left, right) regions of the same non-zero color; zeros represent background/empty space.
 * Small blue components (color 1, size <=5) are absorbed into overlapping or adjacent non-blue components, expanding the absorber's bounding box and size.
 * Small non-blue components (size <=4, excluding colors 0,3,8,9) are absorbed into larger adjacent non-blues, prioritizing by size then color.
 * Greens (color 3) are merged into a single unioned bounding box if multiple exist, but only after other adjustments; however, greens adjacent to reds (color 2) should change to red.
 * Pinks (color 6) and dark reds (color 7) merge bidirectionally based on size and adjacency, with the larger one absorbing the smaller and updating bbox/size.
 * Maroons (color 8) expand vertically by 1 row up/down within grid bounds.
 * Yellows (color 4) below pinks (color 6) change to pink if directly adjacent vertically (yr1 == pr2 + 1) and horizontally overlapping.
 * Greens (color 3) adjacent/overlapping with reds (color 2) change to red.
 * Oranges (color 5) above light blues (color 9) within 2 rows (or1 > lr2 and or1 <= lr2 + 2) and horizontally overlapping change to light blue.
 * Adjacency for merging/overlaps includes touching or zero-gap (distance <=1) horizontally/vertually, but not diagonal.
 * After all processing, fill the entire bounding box of each final component with its color, overriding smaller ones (process larger sizes first); this can overwrite parts of the grid.
 * The final grid is transposed (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Merging order matters (e.g., absorb blues first, then small non-blues, then color adjustments, then special merges like greens/pinks); over-merging can cause unexpected fills; background (0) is preserved only outside bboxes; small components might be intentionally left unmerged if rules don't apply; color changes are conditional on position/orientation (e.g., yellow below pink, not above); expansion only applies to specific colors like maroon; the transpose is always applied last, which can rotate patterns unexpectedly.

Unhelpful/broken functions (avoid in future; they cause over-merging or incorrect conditions):
- `absorb_small_blues`: Absorbs blues but doesn't remove them from consideration, leading to partial overlaps.
- `absorb_small_non_blues`: Deletes small components after absorption but loops incorrectly (i -=1 after del can skip indices); excludes colors like 3,8,9 arbitrarily without puzzle justification.
- `merge_greens`: Unions all greens into one bbox, but examples show greens should sometimes stay separate or change color first.
- `merge_pink_darkred`: Handles bidirectional merge but modifies in-place during loop, risking index errors; assumes pink=6 always tries to absorb 7, but size check is inverted in some cases.
- `expand_maroon`: Only expands vertically, but examples suggest possible horizontal needs; applied too late.
- `adjust_yellow_to_pink`: Checks vertical adjacency but only for yellow below pink; misses horizontal expansion.
- `adjust_green_to_red`: Changes green to red on adjacency, but applied before merge_greens, causing lost merges.
- `adjust_orange_to_lightblue`: Position check (or1 > lr2) assumes orange above lightblue, but distance <=2 may be too loose/tight.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first/detailed attempt provided, but all 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule capture.
 * Train 1: Generated a mostly 7-filled top with misplaced 3 and 8 on right, bottom with 4/9/7/8; expected has vertical 7s on right, horizontal 3s merging downward into a large block, with 0 background below. Missed merging multiple 3s into a single large horizontal-then-vertical structure; over-filled 7s and didn't preserve 0s; 4s stayed yellow instead of adjusting; unknown why 9 appeared in bottom (perhaps unabsorbed blue/orange adjust).
 * Train 2: Generated 7/8 on left/top, large 3 block with misplaced 9s inside; expected has 6s merging left/middle, 8s small in middle, 3s left, 9s bottom-right, 7s right. Failed to merge 6s/pinks properly; didn't adjust or expand 8s/maroon; 9s incorrectly placed/absorbed into 3s; 3s not preserved as separate.
 * Train 3: Generated top 6s and 9/5 right, middle 3/4/8 blocks; expected has top 5s left merging to 3s right, middle 7/8/6/4 structured. Completely mismatched colors (e.g., 6 instead of 5/3, 4 instead of 6); failed bbox fills and transposes led to wrong orientations; no color adjustments like orange to 9.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2s/reds with embedded 6s, bottom full 2s; expected has top/bottom 6s, middle 3s left with 2s right. Over-merged 2s and 6s without position-based separation; missed 3s as a horizontal bar; no absorption or color change for adjacent regions.
 * Overall: Processing order wrong (e.g., color adjusts before merges cause lost unions); bbox adjacency too permissive (includes gaps=1, but examples need exact touching); filling overwrites without preserving shapes; transpose applied but inputs may need rotation consideration; small components not always absorbed (e.g., blues >5 ignored); no handling for background preservation in fills.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct and appears over-simplified/mismatched. It shows large vertical 9/lightblue strips on left/right, a huge 2/red block in middle-top with embedded 8/maroon, bottom 6/pink with 4/yellow and 8, and scattered 7/darkred. This suggests over-merging of 9s/2s/6s into tall bboxes, with incomplete adjustments (e.g., 4s not changed to 6, 8s not expanded properly). Based on training patterns, expected output should have more structured horizontal/vertical color blocks (e.g., merged 3/greens if present, position-based changes like yellow below pink becoming 6, oranges to 9), preserved 0 backgrounds, and no massive fills overwriting distinct regions. The embedded 8 in 2s and scattered 7/4 indicate failed absorption/merging rules; transpose may have rotated incorrectly if input had horizontal emphasis. It doesn't match puzzle subtleties like conditional color shifts or exact adjacency.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of colored regions (represented by integers 1-9, likely corresponding to colors like 1=blue, 2=red, 3=green, etc.), where the goal is to apply interaction rules such as merging small components into adjacent larger ones, changing colors based on specific positional relationships (e.g., adjacency, below, or overlap), expanding certain colors, and finally filling and transposing the grid to produce a transformed output grid. The rules seem to simulate physical or logical interactions between colored blobs, prioritizing larger absorbers, handling special cases for greens and maroons, and ensuring the output reflects merged or altered regions without overlaps.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Connected components must be found using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), tracking bounding boxes (bbox) for min/max rows/columns and size for merging decisions.
 * Small blue (1) components (size <=4) absorb into any adjacent or overlapping non-blue, expanding the absorber's bbox and size; similarly, small non-blue/non-green/maroon/light-blue (size <=4) absorb into larger or special-color components.
 * Color adjustments: Yellow (4) directly below and adjacent to pink (6) changes to 6 and merges; green (3) adjacent or overlapping red (2) changes to 2 and merges into red; orange (5) within 2 rows below light blue (9) with column overlap changes to 9 and merges.
 * Merge similar colors (e.g., specified pairs like 6 and 7) iteratively if adjacent/overlapping, with larger absorbing smaller.
 * All greens (3) merge into a single large green component spanning their collective bbox, regardless of disconnection.
 * Maroon (8) expands vertically by 1 row up/down, but not beyond grid bounds.
 * Final grid filling sorts components by size (largest first) and fills bboxes completely with the component's color, overwriting smaller ones; then transpose the grid (rows become columns).
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes touching edges (not just overlap); bbox expansion must union min/max correctly; deleted components (e.g., marked color=0) are filtered out; iteration in merges can cause chain reactions, so use while loops with re-indexing; greens are handled specially post-other merges, potentially overriding prior changes; transposition is crucial as inputs/outputs are row-major lists but may represent transposed visuals.
 * Easy to miss: Overwriting in filling assumes no partial fills—entire bboxes are solidly colored; small components might be absorbed multiple times if not deepcopy'd properly; color 0 is empty/background; special colors like 3,8,9 are exempt from some small-component rules; distance for orange-to-9 is <=2 rows below with partial column overlap, not full adjacency.
 * Across attempts: No diagonal connectivity; size-based absorption favors largest candidate; handle empty grids gracefully; potential for infinite loops in merges if not careful with deletion/re-indexing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete rule coverage or incorrect application order.
 * Train 1: Generated large pink (6) blocks and misplaced greens (3)/yellows (4)/light blues (9), but expected mostly maroon? (7) with a central green strip and bottom empty (0); missed full green merging across rows, over-applied small absorptions turning yellows/oranges wrong, and didn't clear bottom to 0—bbox filling overwrote incorrectly without filtering empties.
 * Train 2: Generated uniform greens (3) with misplaced light blues (9), but expected mixed 6/8/9/7 with specific positions (e.g., 8 in middle columns); failed to apply yellow-to-pink or orange-to-9 rules properly, and green-red merge didn't trigger (no red present), leading to no color shifts in key areas.
 * Train 3: Generated partial overlaps with 0s and misplaced 5/4/8, but expected consolidated 5/3/7/8/6/4 blocks; bbox adjacent checks for color changes (e.g., 4 below 6) didn't align vertically/horizontally as needed, and maroon expansion didn't apply, leaving gaps (0s) instead of solid fills.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical reds (2) and bottom greens (3), but expected horizontal 6/3/2 bands; completely missed rotation/transposition effects or horizontal merging rules, and green-red interaction didn't expand horizontally.
 * Overall: Absorption favors largest but doesn't handle multi-step chains well (e.g., iterative merges in handle_color_adjustments loop over components without re-filtering); green_merge overrides prior absorptions incorrectly (e.g., turns adjusted greens back); maroon_expansion only vertical, but some cases need horizontal; merge_similar_colors called with hardcoded 6,7 but may need dynamic pairs; no handling for color 7 (maroon?) specifics beyond expansion.
 * Function handle_small_blue_interaction and handle_small_non_blue_interaction are helpful but deepcopy issues cause shared state mutations; bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap is solid for detection but adjacent logic assumes axis-aligned touching without corners.
 * Function handle_green_merge is partially helpful but over-merges disconnected greens into one bbox, which may fill unintended empties (as in Train 1 bottom).
 * Function merge_similar_colors has while loop for iteration but only absorbs smaller into larger unidirectionally, missing symmetric cases; deletion shifts indices, handled with i re-index but can skip if not careful.
 * Function handle_color_adjustments marks deleted with color=0 but loops over copies without immediate filter, leading to stale checks; yellow-to-6 requires exact below-adjacent (y['bbox'][0] == p['bbox'][2] + 1), but misses if not direct; orange-to-9 uses <=2 rows but no adjacency, just overlap in cols—subtle gap distance.
 * Unhelpful/broken: get_size is trivial but fine; program main chain applies steps in order (small blue -> small non-blue -> adjustments -> merge 6/7 -> green -> maroon), but order matters—e.g., adjustments before green merge loses changed greens; no validation for input transposition assumption.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct: it shows massive vertical 9 (light blue?) strips on left/right, a central 2 (red?) band interrupted by 8 (maroon?), bottom 8 expansion, and scattered 7/4/6, but patterns from training suggest more consolidated horizontal bands or merges (e.g., greens absorbing into reds, yellows shifting to pinks below specifics, smalls vanishing into larges), with no clear 0 empties or full bbox unions—likely over-merged disconnected 9s and failed to apply orange-to-9 or green-red rules, leaving jagged 2/8 instead of smooth transformations; bbox filling created solid columns but ignored subtle positional changes (e.g., 4s in bottom should merge up if below 6/9); transposition may have flipped orientations wrong, as training expects blocky regions not stripes; overall, it resembles unprocessed components with partial absorptions but misses core interactions like all-greens-to-one or color shifts, resulting in cluttered non-matching puzzle logic.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image segmentation and region merging, where input grids with colors (including placeholder 1s to be resolved) represent partial or noisy images of shapes or letters, and the goal is to process them into clean, expected outputs by filling ambiguities, identifying connected components, and applying color-specific merge/expansion rules to form coherent regions that match target patterns.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids are transposed at the end, so row/column orientations must account for this (e.g., what appears vertical in input may need horizontal processing post-transpose).
 * Placeholder 1s must be iteratively filled based on the most common adjacent non-1 color, propagating changes until stable; this resolves ambiguities but can over-smooth if not handled carefully.
 * Connected components are 4-way adjacent (up/down/left/right), tracked by bounding boxes (bbox) and size; components of the same color are grouped, but merges happen across specific color pairs or conditions.
 * Specific merge rules: 4-regions adjacent below 6-regions merge into 6 (vertical adjacency check); 5-regions near (dist 1-2 rows below) 9-regions merge into 9; 3 (green) regions adjacent or overlapping with 2 merge into 2; 6 and 7 are complements (13 - color) and merge if adjacent/overlapping, preferring the larger size; all 3 (green) regions across the grid are union-merged into one large green blob regardless of connectivity.
 * Expansion rules: 8 (maroon) expands vertically by 1 row up/down if possible, recalculating size as full bbox area (assumes solid fill); small components (<=4 cells, excluding 3/8/9) absorb into the largest adjacent component if overlapping/adjacent.
 * 9-regions absorb into adjacent 8 if smaller; final grid is filled by largest-to-smallest components to avoid overlaps, but this can overwrite if bboxes overlap incorrectly.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency includes overlap or edge-touching (row/col +1 checks); merges modify in-place with deepcopy to avoid mutation issues, but loops must handle index shifts (e.g., del i requires i adjustment); greens (3) are special-cased for global union, ignoring connectivity; small absorptions prioritize largest neighbor; order of operations matters (e.g., adjust merges before absorb small); unmerged components retain original color but may be overwritten in final fill; 0s remain empty/background.
 * Easy-to-miss: Bbox calculations must update min/max correctly during merges; size is pixel count, not bbox area (except post-expansion for 8); counter for filling 1s uses most_common, breaking ties arbitrarily; no diagonal connectivity; potential over-merging if adjacency is too loose; transpose flips the grid, so expected outputs are post-transpose views.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
 * adjust_four_to_six: Too restrictive (only exact row+1 below, col overlap); misses diagonal or partial adjacencies, leading to unmerged 4s in train 3.
 * adjust_five_to_nine: Distance check (1-2 rows) is arbitrary and fails if not vertically aligned perfectly; doesn't handle horizontal offsets well.
 * adjust_three_to_two: Relies on is_adjacent_or_overlap, but in train 1, it didn't trigger enough, leaving scattered 3s.
 * merge_six_and_seven: Loop breaks on first change but uses while changed outer loop; buggy index handling (i -=1 only in one branch) causes skipped merges or infinite loops in complex cases.
 * merge_all_greens: Unions all 3s globally, which over-merges disconnected greens (e.g., train 1 expected separate 3s in top/right, but this creates one blob covering unrelated areas).
 * expand_maroon: Assumes solid rectangular fill for size post-expansion, but if 8 has holes/gaps, size overestimates; vertical-only expansion misses horizontal needs in some cases.
 * absorb_small_components: Good intent, but excludes 3/8/9 arbitrarily (why not absorb small 9s elsewhere?); sorts by size but always picks largest, ignoring color compatibility.
 * absorb_nine_to_maroon: Only if 9 smaller than 8 and adjacent; but in train 2, 9s weren't absorbed properly, leaving them separate.
 * Overall program: Order of calls (e.g., merge greens after 6/7) can conflict; no handling for color 0s or backgrounds; final fill assumes rectangular bboxes are solid, but components may not be.

**Previous attempts:**
 * All 4 training examples failed, indicating incomplete understanding of merge triggers and order.
 * Train 1: Generated scattered 7s/8s with misplaced 3/4/9; expected large vertical 3s on right/top and 7s, with 0s bottom-left. What worked: Filled 1s and found some components (e.g., large 7/8 blocks). What didn't: Failed to merge all 3s into disconnected vertical strips (global union overdid it); 4s not merged to 6 (no 6 present?); small 3 absorbed wrong; transpose may have flipped placements incorrectly. Mismatch: Generated has horizontal 3 in row 3, but expected vertical 3s; unknown why 4/9 block bottom-middle instead of 0s.
 * Train 2: Generated full-row 3s with partial 9s bottom-right; expected mixed 6/7/3/8/9 with specific placements (e.g., 6 left, 8 middle, 9 bottom-right). What worked: Merged some 3s into rows, detected 8/9 adjacency. What didn't: No 6/7 merging (colors not complemented properly); 9s not absorbed into 8 or expanded; 3s over-merged horizontally instead of keeping shape. Mismatch: Generated lacks 6/7 entirely, has uniform 3 rows vs. expected irregular 3/8/6/9.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal 6/3/4/8 with small 5s; expected vertical 5/3/7/8/6/4/9 patterns. What worked: Detected 6/8 blocks, some 3/4 adjacency. What didn't: 5s left as small unabsorbed (should merge?); 4s not adjusted to 6; no 7/9 handling; bbox overlaps caused overwrite to wrong colors. Mismatch: Generated has uniform rows, but expected has vertical stacks (e.g., 5 top-left, 6 middle-right); 5s appear top-right instead of left.
 * Train 4: Generated vertical 2s left/bottom with 6s middle; expected horizontal 6/3/2 layers. What worked: Merged 2s into large block bottom, some 6 detection. What didn't: No 3-to-2 merge (3s absorbed wrong or missing); 6s not expanded or positioned right; transpose flipped to vertical but expected horizontal. Mismatch: Generated 2s dominate left, but expected 2s right/bottom; 3s vanished entirely (over-absorbed?).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows massive uniform 9 blocks top/middle/bottom with thin 6 strip middle-right, small 8 horizontal bottom, and misplaced 7/4 bottom-middle. This seems over-merged (e.g., all top/middle as 9, ignoring shapes), with no 3s/2s/5s visible and irregular 4/7 insertion bottom. Expected likely has more varied regions (e.g., vertical/horizontal bands of 6/8/9/3 like training, with merges forming letters/shapes); current output lacks structure, has unexplained 4-block in bottom-middle (unmerged?), and 8 not expanded properly. Transpose may have distorted vertical elements to horizontal. It doesn't match training patterns (e.g., no global green union visible, small components not absorbed cleanly), suggesting misses in color-specific rules for this larger grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle that processes a noisy grid of integers (representing colors or labels, with 0 and 1 as noise) to detect and reconstruct blocky, striped regions by ignoring noise, mapping specific values, filling/expanding certain colors into zeros, and finally transposing the grid to produce a cleaned-up output grid.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Grids consist of integers 0-9, where 0 and 1 are treated as noise and ignored when computing modes (most common non-noise value in rows/columns/segments).
 * Horizontal stripes are identified by grouping consecutive rows with the same row-mode (non-noise dominant value); this assumes large uniform bands vertically.
 * Within each stripe, horizontal subdivisions are made by grouping consecutive columns with the same column-mode (computed over the stripe's rows); this creates blocky sub-regions.
 * A mapping function remaps specific values (6→7, 4→0, 8→0, 9→3, 5→9) before assigning colors to blocks, suggesting a color substitution rule to normalize or reveal hidden patterns.
 * In the reconstructed grid, block color prefers the column-mode (if non-zero after mapping) over the row-mode, but falls back to row-mode if column-mode is zero; this prioritizes vertical consistency within stripes.
 * Post-reconstruction, zeros adjacent to 3's are iteratively expanded into 3's (flood-fill like), but only for 3's—other values don't expand; this happens before transposition and can propagate changes across the grid.
 * Final transposition (rows become columns) rotates the cleaned grid 90 degrees, implying the puzzle's orientation or viewing direction changes after processing.
 * Subtleties: Mode ignores only 0/1, so other low-count values (e.g., 2-9) can influence if dominant; stripes must be exact mode matches, potentially missing subtle gradients or non-full-width blocks; expansion is directional (4-neighbors) and iterative until stable, but only affects 0's next to 3's, missing opportunities for other colors; mapping is asymmetric and doesn't handle all values (e.g., 2,3,7 unchanged), which might miss puzzle-specific substitutions; no vertical stripe detection, assuming horizontal dominance; noise might form patterns that mislead modes; grids can have varying sizes, but code assumes rectangular; post-transpose, expansion effects rotate, altering final patterns.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single previous attempt used horizontal stripe detection, noise-ignoring modes, value mapping, block reconstruction with column/row mode priority, 3-expansion into 0's, and final transpose, showing partial understanding of cleaning noisy blocky grids but failing all training examples due to incorrect region detection and filling.
 * Train 1: Generated large top 7-block (rows 0-7, cols 0-12) and bottom 0/7 strips, but expected a mixed 7/3 pattern with 3's expanding into a mid-block (rows 4-6 full 3's, partial in others) and 0's only at bottom-left; differences: over-filled 7's into expected 3-areas (e.g., cols 10-12 rows 0-3 should be 3 not 7), no mid-3 expansion, bottom rows all 0-left but expected 3-right and 7-right; unknown why stripe detection merged rows 0-7 as single 7-mode ignoring 3's.
 * Train 2: Generated irregular 7/3 patterns in top (e.g., row 1 has isolated 7 in col 6) and bottom 3/7/9 blocks, but expected uniform 6-left bands, 3-top-left, 8/6/9 patterned mid-right, 7-right; differences: wrong mappings/colors (e.g., generated 7/3/9 vs expected 6/3/8/9/7, suggesting map_mode mishandled inputs like 6→7 incorrectly applied), no vertical consistency, expansion didn't create expected 6/8 bands; subdivision likely broke on noise, creating jagged edges.
 * Train 3: Generated top 7/9 blocks and mid 3/7 patterns with some irregularities (e.g., row 6 col 4=7 isolated), but expected top 5/3 bands, mid 7/8/6/3/4 patterned rows; differences: top rows 0-2 cols 0-8=7 vs expected 5, right cols 9-13 mixed 9/3 vs 3/6/4, lower rows over-filled 3's ignoring 7/8/6/4 variations; stripe finder probably detected wrong modes (e.g., 5→9 mapping created false 9-stripe), no handling for non-uniform row modes within expected blocks.
 * Train 4: Generated left 2's (rows 0-6 cols 0-2), mid-right 7/3 blocks, bottom full 3's, but expected alternating 6/3/2 bands vertically; differences: top/mid 2/7/3 vs expected 6/2, bottom 3's correct but upper rows wrong (e.g., rows 0-2 cols 0-6=6 not 2/7), no alternation or vertical stripe logic—horizontal-only approach filled uniformly, missing row-varied patterns; expansion didn't apply as no 3's to expand initially.
 * Function `build_blocky_grid` is partially helpful for reconstruction but broken in practice: it creates overly uniform blocks by row-mode fallback, ignoring subtle column variations and leading to solid fills where patterns are expected; don't rely on it without fixing fallback logic.
 * No extraction of "objects" (e.g., bounded regions) attempted, but it might be needed for non-stripe shapes; current mode-based approach misses isolated or diagonal patterns.
 * Mapping `map_mode` seems essential but incomplete—handles some (6,4,8,9,5) but leaves others (2,3,7) unchanged, causing mismatches like 6→7 when expected 6 stays or maps differently.
 * Expansion `expand_three_into_zeros` is helpful for 3-filling but too narrow (only 3's, not other colors like expected 6/8 in Train 2); iterative nature is good but pre-transpose timing propagates wrong if blocks are misidentified.
 * Overall, attempt demonstrates core ideas (noise ignore, stripes, map, expand, transpose) but fails on detection accuracy, leading to wrong color assignments and no sample passing.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it shows large uniform 3-left blocks (cols 0-9 rows 0-24), mid 7/2/3 mixed but jagged (e.g., row 6 col 10=2-start but irregular widths, row 14 col 8=2-overlap into 3's), bottom 7/3 full rows, with some 0's absent—suggests overzealous stripe merging created massive 3/7 bands, but expected output (mentally simulated) should have more varied vertical/horizontal blocks post-transpose, like expanded 3's into patterned regions (e.g., based on Train 1's 3-expansion) and correct mappings for 2/7 areas without the wide uniform fills; differences include no clear block alternation (test has long 3-strips rows 0-5 cols 0-9, but likely needs subdivided 3/7/2 patterns), expansion seems partial (some 0's missing where adjacent to 3's), and transpose may have rotated wrong noisy reconstruction; it doesn't match expected clean blocky art (e.g., potential logo/image with distinct color zones), appearing too monotonous left-side.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". 

Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem. Grade harshly, if the problem understanding is not demonstrated, give a low or 0 score. If the problem is partially understood (only some elements are understood), still give a lower score around 3/10. Only give a score above 5/10 if core elements are understood OR some training samples pass. Only give a high score (above 7/10) if core principles are demonstrated AND some training samples pass.

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-10-03 16:35:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grids of colored cells (integers representing colors like 0 for empty, 3 for green, etc.) where the goal is to process the input grid by filling holes, identifying connected components of the same color, merging specific components based on adjacency, overlap, or position rules, absorbing small regions, expanding certain colors, and finally creating a filled output grid that is transposed. The processed grid likely represents simplified or combined shapes (possibly digits or objects) that match expected patterns in training examples.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * The puzzle requires handling connected components of the same color using 4-directional adjacency (up, down, left, right), but with custom merging rules for specific color pairs (e.g., 4 merges into 6 if directly below it with column overlap; 5 merges into 9 if positioned specifically below with row offset 1-2 and column overlap; 3 merges into 2 if adjacent or overlapping).
 * Hole filling starts from non-1 cells and floods into adjacent 1's (assuming 1's are holes), but this seems mismatched as training outputs suggest holes might be treated differently or not filled at all in some cases.
 * Merging must account for bounding box (bbox) adjacency or overlap, including direct touching (e.g., row+1 adjacency) but not diagonal; however, the bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap function misses corner touching or more complex overlaps seen in expectations.
 * Greens (3) need merging if adjacent, but also specific absorption into 2; small components (<=4 size, excluding 0,3,8,9) get absorbed into the largest adjacent large component, which may over-merge unrelated small blobs.
 * Maroon (8) components are expanded by 1 row above/below, and size recalculated as full bbox area (not actual cells), which could overwrite other areas incorrectly.
 * Final grid is filled by largest components first, then transposed (rows become columns), but this leads to mismatches if merging order or expansion is wrong.
 * Subtleties: Color-specific rules imply shapes representing numbers (e.g., 4+6=0?, 5+9=8?, 3+2=5?, 6+7=9?), but not consistent; grids may have irregular shapes, so bbox-based merging approximates but fails on non-rectangular blobs; 0's are background and should not be components; training examples show vertical/horizontal symmetries or patterns (e.g., bars, blocks) that transposition flips, but generated outputs often keep wrong orientations or colors.
 * Easy to miss: Merging loops must be iterative until no changes (as in merge_six_and_seven and merge_adjacent_greens), but single-pass functions like adjust_four_to_six fail on chains; small components absorption ignores color compatibility; expansion of 8 assumes rectangular growth but may encroach on edges; transposition is always last, so pre-transpose logic must align with expected post-flip.
 * All training examples are transposed outputs, suggesting input might be non-transposed, but code applies transpose at end—verify if inputs need pre-processing.
 * Consider edge cases: Empty grids, single-cell components, components touching borders, or colors not in {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} (e.g., 1 as holes?).

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict
from collections import deque

def get_size(g: List[List[int]]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not g:
        return 0, 0
    return len(g), len(g[0])
```
Basic grid sizing, useful for bounds checking.

```python
def fill_holes(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (code as provided: floods from non-1 cells into adjacent 1's, assigning color)
    # Helpful for hole filling if 1's are indeed holes, but may be over-aggressive or wrong (e.g., treats all non-1 as sources).
```
Potentially useful if holes are 1's, but likely broken as it colors holes with surrounding color—training suggests some "holes" (0's?) remain empty.

```python
def find_connected_components(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # (code as provided: BFS for same-color components, computes bbox and size)
    # Returns list of dicts with 'color', 'bbox' (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c), 'size'.
```
Core and helpful: Extracts components with bbox for merging; uses deque for efficient BFS; tracks min/max for bbox accurately.

```python
def bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap(b1: Tuple[int, int, int, int], b2: Tuple[int, int, int, int]) -> bool:
    # (code as provided: checks overlap or vertical/horizontal adjacency by +1 row/col)
    # Does not handle diagonal adjacency or same-row touching without overlap.
```
Helpful base for merging, but incomplete—misses cases like corner touching (e.g., (r2,c2) adjacent to (r3,c3) where r3=r2+1, c3=c2+1).

```python
def create_filled_grid(components: List[Dict], h: int, w: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (code as provided: sorts by size descending, fills bbox with color)
    # Overwrites smaller components if bboxes overlap post-merge.
```
Helpful for reconstructing grid, but assumes rectangular fills—wrong for non-rect blobs; sorting by size prevents small overwrites.

```python
def transpose_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    # (code as provided: zip(*g) to transpose)
    # Essential, as all expectations are transposed versions.
```
Useful and correct for final step.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; all 4 training examples failed, indicating core issues in merging rules and hole handling.
 * Train 1: Generated has large 6-block on left/top, small 3's in middle, 4/9 bottom-left, 8's right, with scattered 0's; expected has 7's dominant with 3's as a vertical bar on right/middle. Missed: Merging 6/7 into larger 7-block; 3's not forming bar; 4/9 not absorbed into 7 or 3; extra 0's and 8's; transposition may have flipped wrong (generated seems horizontally oriented vs. expected vertical). What worked: Some component detection (e.g., 8's on right), but sizes/positions wrong.
 * Train 2: Generated has 7's left, 8's top-right, 3's middle, 9's bottom-right; expected has 6's left/top, 3/8/6/9 in specific L-shapes, 7's right. Missed: 7->6 remapping? No 6's generated; 3's too wide; 8's in wrong position (top vs. middle); 9's correct position but wrong merge. What worked: Some vertical stacking (e.g., 3's and 9's), but colors and adjacencies fail (e.g., no 6-block from merging).
 * Train 3: Generated keeps 6's top, 3's left-middle, 4's/8's right, 9's top-right, 5 single; expected has 5's left-top, 3's middle, 7/8/6/4 in cross-shape. Missed: 6->5? No 5-block; 4 not merged into 6 properly; 3's not extended; 9/5 not combined into 8 or similar; single 5 vs. block. What worked: Horizontal 3/4/8 row detection, but vertical merging absent.
 * Train 4: Generated has 2's left throughout, 6's right; expected has 6's top/bottom, 3's middle, 2's right. Missed: 2/6 not swapped or merged into 6/3/2 pattern; no 3's at all (3->2 merge over-applied?); uniform columns wrong vs. expected varying heights. What worked: Large block detection (2's and 6's), but no green (3) insertion or height variation.
 * Overall: adjust_four_to_six and adjust_five_to_nine are too rigid (specific row offsets, single-pass, modifies in-place without removing merged); merge_six_and_seven and merge_adjacent_greens are iterative but only for subsets, miss cross-color chains; absorb_small_components ignores color (e.g., absorbs 4 into wrong large); expand_maroon_components over-expands 8's into non-8 areas; fill_holes likely wrong (colors 1's but expectations have 0's persisting). bboxes_adjacent_or_overlap too narrow. No handling for color remapping post-merge (e.g., merged 6+7 stays 6 or 7? Code keeps large's color).
 * Function `fill_holes` is likely broken or not relevant (over-fills, assumes 1's are holes but inputs may use 0's; don't use without verification).
 * Function `adjust_three_to_two` is helpful but incomplete (relies on adjacency, but may need position-specific like others).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it shows massive 9-blocks dominating left/center (rows 0-14,20-29), a thin 8-block bottom-right (rows 15-29, cols 21+), scattered 6's in middle-right (cols 14-26, all rows), a small 7-block bottom-left (row 21, cols 1-5), and a large 4-block bottom-middle (rows 22-25, cols 6-25). This creates irregular, overlapping fills (e.g., 6's piercing 9's) and doesn't form coherent shapes like bars or digits—likely from over-merging 9's, under-merging 6/7/4, and expansion causing bbox bloat. Expected should probably have cleaner blocks (e.g., merged 9/6 into larger uniform regions, 7/4 forming extensions, 8 expanded but not overwriting), with transposition flipping to match training patterns (vertical bars, L-shapes); current output seems noisy and asymmetric, missing subtle merges (e.g., 7 into 9? 4 into 6?) and retaining too many distinct components.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10
