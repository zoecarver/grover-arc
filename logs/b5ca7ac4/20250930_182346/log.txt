=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:23:46] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

def copy_grid(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """Copy the input grid as is."""
    return [row[:] for row in g]

def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
    """The main program that applies the rules by copying the grid."""
    return copy_grid(g)

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 18:37:39] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

[2025-09-30 18:37:39] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 18:42:50] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 18:42:50] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 18:49:50] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

Prompt: Succinctly describe all elements in this visual puzzle as one bullet list, generalized over both input and output.
Input image: logs/b5ca7ac4/20250930_182346/test_0_input.png
Output image: logs/b5ca7ac4/20250930_182346/train_0_output.png

[2025-09-30 18:50:02] Response:
- **Backgrounds**: Blue in input, black in output, serving as neutral canvas for colored squares.
- **Squares**: Nine primary squares per image, arranged in irregular 3x3-like grid with slight offsets; each features an outer border (frame) and inner fill of distinct colors.
- **Colors used**: Consistent palette across both—yellow, orange, red, green, blue, purple (or pink/magenta variant), maroon/brown; no exact matches between inner/outer pairs, emphasizing contrast.
- **Nesting structure**: Each square has a solid inner colored block fully enclosed by a thicker outer colored border; no overlaps between squares, but positions vary slightly for visual separation.
- **Positions**: Top row (3 squares), middle row (3 squares), bottom row (3 squares); input shows more vertical stacking, output more horizontal clustering, but both maintain spatial puzzle layout for pattern recognition.
- **Variations**: Input emphasizes rotation/tilting effects in placement; output shows straighter alignments; all squares identical in size (square aspect ratio), no text or additional shapes.

=== Stage 2: Interconnection Finder ===
[2025-09-30 18:50:02] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Backgrounds**: Blue in input, black in output, serving as neutral canvas for colored squares.
- **Squares**: Nine primary squares per image, arranged in irregular 3x3-like grid with slight offsets; each features an outer border (frame) and inner fill of distinct colors.
- **Colors used**: Consistent palette across both—yellow, orange, red, green, blue, purple (or pink/magenta variant), maroon/brown; no exact matches between inner/outer pairs, emphasizing contrast.
- **Nesting structure**: Each square has a solid inner colored block fully enclosed by a thicker outer colored border; no overlaps between squares, but positions vary slightly for visual separation.
- **Positions**: Top row (3 squares), middle row (3 squares), bottom row (3 squares); input shows more vertical stacking, output more horizontal clustering, but both maintain spatial puzzle layout for pattern recognition.
- **Variations**: Input emphasizes rotation/tilting effects in placement; output shows straighter alignments; all squares identical in size (square aspect ratio), no text or additional shapes.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (1-3), below is a list of components and their properties, focusing only on those with clear, direct interactions or effects (e.g., nesting, merging, transformations) that are consistent across **every** train example. Only obvious connections are included—e.g., spatial relationships via bbox, numerical effects via holes/pixels, or grouping via color. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., background canvas color change from blue to black, which has no effect on other components) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., the large full-canvas shape's hole count or pixel changes, present in train 2/3 but absent in train 1; exact inner-to-hole matching, which holds in train 1/3 but has one extra small h=0 in train 2) are noted as recurring but not universally consistent, or called unknown where no clear interaction explains variations. No high-level puzzle solution or forcing of unobservable connections (e.g., semantic meanings like "tilting" not derivable from data) is attempted.

#### Core Components
1. **Outer Frames**:
   - **Properties**: Color is always Red or Maroon; holes >=1; pixels = 16 * holes; bbox size typically ~4x4 units per sub-unit (scales with holes for merged); represents framed/enclosing regions.
   - **Count**: Total "units" (sum of holes across all outer frames) = 6-8 per example, split between Red and Maroon (e.g., train 1: 5 Red + 3 Maroon units; train 2: 4 each; train 3: 3 each).

2. **Inner Fills**:
   - **Properties**: Colors from consistent palette excluding Red/Maroon (e.g., Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, Light Blue, Pink; one Red h=0 variant in train 3); holes=0; pixels=9 (consistent except one outlier at 10 in train 2 output, possibly a shape variant but no clear effect); bbox size ~3x3 units, always fully nested inside an outer frame's bbox.
   - **Count**: Exactly matches total outer units (e.g., 8 in train 1/2, 6 in train 3); no merging among inners.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections (Present in Every Train Example)
These are direct effects or relations (e.g., one property causes change in another) observed via matching properties across input/output pairs. Only those holding in all three trains are listed.

1. **Color-Based Merging (Outer Frames → Outer Frames)**:
   - Outer frames of the **same color** (Red with Red; Maroon with Maroon) interact by grouping and merging into fewer frames.
   - Effect: Merged frame inherits the color; holes = number of original units merged (summed); pixels = 16 * holes (additive); bbox = new position/size (union-like, often expanded horizontally/vertically).
   - Consistency: Total units per color preserved exactly (no loss/gain); number of final merged/single frames varies (e.g., train 1: Red units merge into 1x h=4 + 1x h=1; train 2: Red into 1x h=2 + 2x h=1; train 3: Red into 1x h=2 + 1x h=1). No cross-color merging (Red ≠ Maroon). Inners do not trigger or affect this.
   - No effect on inners' colors or counts.

2. **Spatial Nesting (Inner Fills ↔ Outer Frames)**:
   - Each inner fill's bbox is fully contained within one outer frame's bbox (x1_outer <= x1_inner, x2_outer >= x2_inner, same for y).
   - Effect: Contributes to outer's holes (each nested inner "fills" one hole); total inners = total outer holes across all outers (exact match in all examples).
   - Consistency: In output, inners are reassigned to new/merged outers (e.g., train 1: 8 inners redistributed to match 8 holes in new Red/Maroon frames; same for train 2/3). Nesting prevents bbox overlap between separate components (outers/inners do not intersect unless nested). Position of inner affects outer's effective structure (hole "usage"), but not outer's color/pixels.
   - Unknown: Exact reassignment rule (e.g., which inner goes to which merged outer); in train 2 output, one extra small h=0 (Yellow, pixels=10, thin bbox) nests inside a h=2 outer despite the count match, suggesting possible inner position → minor pixel/shape variation, but not consistent.

3. **Position → Transformation (All Components ↔ Bbox)**:
   - Input bboxes (often irregular/offset, e.g., vertical stacking) transform to new bboxes in output (more aligned/clustered, e.g., horizontal in rows).
   - Effect: Affects nesting (inners repositioned inside new outer bboxes); enables merging (same-color outers move to adjacent positions for union bbox). No change to size per unit (~4x4 outer, ~3x3 inner), but merged bboxes expand (e.g., h=4 outer ~9x13 units in train 1 output).
   - Consistency: Every component (outers/inners) changes position; total layout remains ~3x3 grid-like (9 slots, some merged). No color or holes change from position alone.
   - Unknown: Specific transformation rule (e.g., no consistent position → color shift; e.g., top-row Red in input 1 becomes right-column in output).

4. **Holes → Pixels Scaling (Outer Frames Internal)**:
   - An outer frame's holes directly determine its pixels (multiplicative: 16 per hole).
   - Effect: Merging increases holes, scaling pixels accordingly; no effect on inners.
   - Consistency: Holds for all outers in input/output (e.g., h=1 always 16; h=2 always 32; h=4 always 64). Inners fixed at 9 (no scaling).

#### Recurring but Not Universally Consistent Interactions (Present in Train 2/3 Only)
These appear in every example where the component exists but are absent in train 1, so not "every puzzle."
- **Large Canvas Shape → Hole Elimination**: Full-bbox ([0,0,21,21]) shape (color: Yellow in train 2, Blue in train 3; holes=4-6, pixels~274-334 in input) transforms to holes=0 (pixels similar/slightly reduced). Effect: Neutralizes holes (possibly "filling" them), no nesting/merging with small components. Unknown: Why holes=4/6 (not tied to outer units/inners); absent in train 1.

#### Elements with No Consistent Interactions
- Inners' colors (e.g., Green → position): No consistent effect (e.g., Green inners nest in Red/Maroon outers variably; no color-specific movement).
- Pixel outliers (e.g., train 2 output Yellow h=0 at 10 pixels): No clear cause/effect (possibly position → thin bbox, but only once).
- Total component count: Varies (6-8 units/inners), no fixed interaction.
- No text, additional shapes, or overlaps affect anything consistently.

This covers all observable, consistent connections from the data. For the test input, similar components are present (3 Red + 4 Maroon outer units, 8 inners, large Light Blue h=6), suggesting same interactions would apply, but no output provided to verify.

[2025-09-30 18:52:00] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### Interconnected Components and Properties

Based on analysis of the provided train inputs and outputs (1-3), below is a list of components and their properties, focusing only on those with clear, direct interactions or effects (e.g., nesting, merging, transformations) that are consistent across **every** train example. Only obvious connections are included—e.g., spatial relationships via bbox, numerical effects via holes/pixels, or grouping via color. Irrelevant or standalone elements (e.g., background canvas color change from blue to black, which has no effect on other components) are excluded. Inconsistent elements (e.g., the large full-canvas shape's hole count or pixel changes, present in train 2/3 but absent in train 1; exact inner-to-hole matching, which holds in train 1/3 but has one extra small h=0 in train 2) are noted as recurring but not universally consistent, or called unknown where no clear interaction explains variations. No high-level puzzle solution or forcing of unobservable connections (e.g., semantic meanings like "tilting" not derivable from data) is attempted.

#### Core Components
1. **Outer Frames**:
   - **Properties**: Color is always Red or Maroon; holes >=1; pixels = 16 * holes; bbox size typically ~4x4 units per sub-unit (scales with holes for merged); represents framed/enclosing regions.
   - **Count**: Total "units" (sum of holes across all outer frames) = 6-8 per example, split between Red and Maroon (e.g., train 1: 5 Red + 3 Maroon units; train 2: 4 each; train 3: 3 each).

2. **Inner Fills**:
   - **Properties**: Colors from consistent palette excluding Red/Maroon (e.g., Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, Light Blue, Pink; one Red h=0 variant in train 3); holes=0; pixels=9 (consistent except one outlier at 10 in train 2 output, possibly a shape variant but no clear effect); bbox size ~3x3 units, always fully nested inside an outer frame's bbox.
   - **Count**: Exactly matches total outer units (e.g., 8 in train 1/2, 6 in train 3); no merging among inners.

#### Consistent Interactions and Connections (Present in Every Train Example)
These are direct effects or relations (e.g., one property causes change in another) observed via matching properties across input/output pairs. Only those holding in all three trains are listed.

1. **Color-Based Merging (Outer Frames → Outer Frames)**:
   - Outer frames of the **same color** (Red with Red; Maroon with Maroon) interact by grouping and merging into fewer frames.
   - Effect: Merged frame inherits the color; holes = number of original units merged (summed); pixels = 16 * holes (additive); bbox = new position/size (union-like, often expanded horizontally/vertically).
   - Consistency: Total units per color preserved exactly (no loss/gain); number of final merged/single frames varies (e.g., train 1: Red units merge into 1x h=4 + 1x h=1; train 2: Red into 1x h=2 + 2x h=1; train 3: Red into 1x h=2 + 1x h=1). No cross-color merging (Red ≠ Maroon). Inners do not trigger or affect this.
   - No effect on inners' colors or counts.

2. **Spatial Nesting (Inner Fills ↔ Outer Frames)**:
   - Each inner fill's bbox is fully contained within one outer frame's bbox (x1_outer <= x1_inner, x2_outer >= x2_inner, same for y).
   - Effect: Contributes to outer's holes (each nested inner "fills" one hole); total inners = total outer holes across all outers (exact match in all examples).
   - Consistency: In output, inners are reassigned to new/merged outers (e.g., train 1: 8 inners redistributed to match 8 holes in new Red/Maroon frames; same for train 2/3). Nesting prevents bbox overlap between separate components (outers/inners do not intersect unless nested). Position of inner affects outer's effective structure (hole "usage"), but not outer's color/pixels.
   - Unknown: Exact reassignment rule (e.g., which inner goes to which merged outer); in train 2 output, one extra small h=0 (Yellow, pixels=10, thin bbox) nests inside a h=2 outer despite the count match, suggesting possible inner position → minor pixel/shape variation, but not consistent.

3. **Position → Transformation (All Components ↔ Bbox)**:
   - Input bboxes (often irregular/offset, e.g., vertical stacking) transform to new bboxes in output (more aligned/clustered, e.g., horizontal in rows).
   - Effect: Affects nesting (inners repositioned inside new outer bboxes); enables merging (same-color outers move to adjacent positions for union bbox). No change to size per unit (~4x4 outer, ~3x3 inner), but merged bboxes expand (e.g., h=4 outer ~9x13 units in train 1 output).
   - Consistency: Every component (outers/inners) changes position; total layout remains ~3x3 grid-like (9 slots, some merged). No color or holes change from position alone.
   - Unknown: Specific transformation rule (e.g., no consistent position → color shift; e.g., top-row Red in input 1 becomes right-column in output).

4. **Holes → Pixels Scaling (Outer Frames Internal)**:
   - An outer frame's holes directly determine its pixels (multiplicative: 16 per hole).
   - Effect: Merging increases holes, scaling pixels accordingly; no effect on inners.
   - Consistency: Holds for all outers in input/output (e.g., h=1 always 16; h=2 always 32; h=4 always 64). Inners fixed at 9 (no scaling).

#### Recurring but Not Universally Consistent Interactions (Present in Train 2/3 Only)
These appear in every example where the component exists but are absent in train 1, so not "every puzzle."
- **Large Canvas Shape → Hole Elimination**: Full-bbox ([0,0,21,21]) shape (color: Yellow in train 2, Blue in train 3; holes=4-6, pixels~274-334 in input) transforms to holes=0 (pixels similar/slightly reduced). Effect: Neutralizes holes (possibly "filling" them), no nesting/merging with small components. Unknown: Why holes=4/6 (not tied to outer units/inners); absent in train 1.

#### Elements with No Consistent Interactions
- Inners' colors (e.g., Green → position): No consistent effect (e.g., Green inners nest in Red/Maroon outers variably; no color-specific movement).
- Pixel outliers (e.g., train 2 output Yellow h=0 at 10 pixels): No clear cause/effect (possibly position → thin bbox, but only once).
- Total component count: Varies (6-8 units/inners), no fixed interaction.
- No text, additional shapes, or overlaps affect anything consistently.

This covers all observable, consistent connections from the data. For the test input, similar components are present (3 Red + 4 Maroon outer units, 8 inners, large Light Blue h=6), suggesting same interactions would apply, but no output provided to verify.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:02:52] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

[2025-09-30 19:02:58] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

[2025-09-30 19:05:18] Response:
- **Nesting and Containment Interaction**: Inner shapes (always holes=0, pixels=9, colors such as Orange, Blue, Green, Light Blue, Pink, Yellow, or variants like Red/Dark Red as inner) have bounding boxes that are fully contained within the bounding boxes of outer shapes (always Red or Maroon, holes>=1, pixels=16*holes). This containment is present in every small unit and merged unit across all train inputs and outputs.

- **Hole Count Determination**: The holes property of an outer shape (Red or Maroon) is exactly equal to the number of inner shapes (holes=0, pixels=9) with bounding boxes fully contained within its own bounding box. This holds consistently for all outer shapes (small and merged) in every train input and output; it does not apply to large canvas-encompassing shapes.

- **Pixels Calculation for Outers**: For outer shapes (Red or Maroon, holes>=1), the pixels property is always 16 multiplied by the holes value (e.g., holes=1 → pixels=16; holes=2 → pixels=32). This is consistent for all outer shapes across every train input and output; inner shapes always have pixels=9 regardless of color.

- **Color Restriction on Components**: Outer shapes are exclusively Red or Maroon (with the properties above); inner shapes use all other colors (or Red/Maroon when functioning as inner). No exceptions or overlaps in role by color across all examples.

- **Merging of Same-Color Outers**: Multiple outer shapes of the identical color (Red with Red, or Maroon with Maroon) combine into a single larger outer shape of that color, where the resulting holes = sum of original holes values, pixels = 16 * resulting holes, and bbox = minimal enclosing box of all original outers' bboxes (retaining all contained inners). This structural merging occurs consistently in outputs where same-color outers cluster, but the trigger (e.g., adjacency) is unknown.

- **Position-Based Containment Effect**: The relative positions (bbox coordinates) of inner shapes directly determine which outer shape they are assigned to for hole counting (via full containment). Positions of outers relative to each other enable merging when same-color. However, the broader transformation of absolute positions (e.g., shifts leading to clustering/merging) is unknown and consistent only in that it preserves containment post-transformation.

- **Large Encompassing Shapes (Inconsistent Presence)**: In some examples (train inputs/outputs 2 and 3, test input 1), a large shape (color Yellow/Blue/Light Blue, bbox=[0,0,21,21], high pixels ~270-334, variable holes) contains all other components. Its holes and pixels vary without a clear consistent relation to contained inners or outers (e.g., holes do not match inner count), and it is absent in others (train 1), so interactions are unknown.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:05:18] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided in this attempt, as the program only copies the grid without any extraction or manipulation. Future attempts should include:

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

- **Nesting and Containment Interaction**: Inner shapes (always holes=0, pixels=9, colors such as Orange, Blue, Green, Light Blue, Pink, Yellow, or variants like Red/Dark Red as inner) have bounding boxes that are fully contained within the bounding boxes of outer shapes (always Red or Maroon, holes>=1, pixels=16*holes). This containment is present in every small unit and merged unit across all train inputs and outputs.

- **Hole Count Determination**: The holes property of an outer shape (Red or Maroon) is exactly equal to the number of inner shapes (holes=0, pixels=9) with bounding boxes fully contained within its own bounding box. This holds consistently for all outer shapes (small and merged) in every train input and output; it does not apply to large canvas-encompassing shapes.

- **Pixels Calculation for Outers**: For outer shapes (Red or Maroon, holes>=1), the pixels property is always 16 multiplied by the holes value (e.g., holes=1 → pixels=16; holes=2 → pixels=32). This is consistent for all outer shapes across every train input and output; inner shapes always have pixels=9 regardless of color.

- **Color Restriction on Components**: Outer shapes are exclusively Red or Maroon (with the properties above); inner shapes use all other colors (or Red/Maroon when functioning as inner). No exceptions or overlaps in role by color across all examples.

- **Merging of Same-Color Outers**: Multiple outer shapes of the identical color (Red with Red, or Maroon with Maroon) combine into a single larger outer shape of that color, where the resulting holes = sum of original holes values, pixels = 16 * resulting holes, and bbox = minimal enclosing box of all original outers' bboxes (retaining all contained inners). This structural merging occurs consistently in outputs where same-color outers cluster, but the trigger (e.g., adjacency) is unknown.

- **Position-Based Containment Effect**: The relative positions (bbox coordinates) of inner shapes directly determine which outer shape they are assigned to for hole counting (via full containment). Positions of outers relative to each other enable merging when same-color. However, the broader transformation of absolute positions (e.g., shifts leading to clustering/merging) is unknown and consistent only in that it preserves containment post-transformation.

- **Large Encompassing Shapes (Inconsistent Presence)**: In some examples (train inputs/outputs 2 and 3, test input 1), a large shape (color Yellow/Blue/Light Blue, bbox=[0,0,21,21], high pixels ~270-334, variable holes) contains all other components. Its holes and pixels vary without a clear consistent relation to contained inners or outers (e.g., holes do not match inner count), and it is absent in others (train 1), so interactions are unknown.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:14:20] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

Output image: logs/b5ca7ac4/20250930_182346/train_0_output.png

[2025-09-30 19:14:29] Response:
- **Backgrounds**: Uniform solid color fields (blue in input, black in output).
- **Primary shapes**: Concentric or adjacent squares in pairs, with outer frames and inner fills of contrasting colors.
- **Color palette**: Includes yellow, red/orange, green, blue, purple/magenta, pink, maroon/brown; used for both frames and interiors, rotated or remapped across positions.
- **Positions**: Eight figures arranged in irregular or grid-like layout (e.g., 3x3 with variations), scattered non-overlapping on the canvas.
- **Nesting/Structure**: Each figure features a larger outer square (border-style) enclosing a smaller inner square (solid fill), with color swaps or inversions between input and output.
- **Variations**: Rotations, reflections, or color permutations applied to figures; input shows vibrant primaries on blue, output shifts to darker tones on black.
- **Overall pattern**: Abstract composition of 8 unique nested square pairs, suggesting a transformation rule (e.g., color inversion or positional shift) from input to output.

[2025-09-30 19:14:29] Prompt:
This is a visual puzzle. Don't try to solve it. Just interconnected components. What to identify: elements that interact with each other or effect each other. This could be shapes that seem to have some connection or interaction, colors that effect movement, shapes properties (edges, holes, or silhouettes) that effect movement, position effects transformation or movement. We want a list of interconnected properties and components. What we DON'T want: a total solution, high level understanding, etc. What we DON'T want: elements that are irrelevant to the puzzle. Elements that do not have any interaction or connection. Elements that don't have consistent interaction across all examples. Only identify interactions or connections that are consistent in EVERY puzzle.

Any property may be used to find connections: position -> color, position -> position, hole count -> color, specific shape -> transform, and so on.

IMPORTANT: some shapes or semantic meaning may not be identifiable given the information provided, do not force connections that are not there. Do not attempt to solve this problem. Your job is only to identify connections that are obvious and consistent, if you cannot explain a transformation, call that out as an unkown rather than trying to explain it.

- **Nesting/Structure**: Each figure features a larger outer square (border-style) enclosing a smaller inner square (solid fill), with color swaps or inversions between input and output.
- **Variations**: Rotations, reflections, or color permutations applied to figures; input shows vibrant primaries on blue, output shifts to darker tones on black.
- **Overall pattern**: Abstract composition of 8 unique nested square pairs, suggesting a transformation rule (e.g., color inversion or positional shift) from input to output.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are only obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** train examples (inputs and outputs). These are limited to properties like nesting, positional relationships, hole counts affecting containment, and color restrictions on specific component types. Only elements with clear, direct interactions (e.g., one property affecting another's position or count) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone shapes without nesting or containment) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear relations (e.g., exact pixel counts for full-canvas shapes, or full-canvas hole counts relating to inners) are noted as unknown rather than explained. No high-level puzzle solution or transformation rules are inferred or provided.

1. **Single-frame nesting (holes=1 frames interact with inner solids via precise centering)**:
   - Components: Red or Maroon frame (holes=1, pixels=16, bbox always 4x4 square) + one inner solid (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox always 2x2 square, any color except matching the frame's Red/Maroon).
   - Interaction: The frame always contains exactly one inner solid. The inner's position is directly determined by the frame's position (positional offset effect): inner_bbox = [frame_x + 1, frame_y + 1, frame_x + 3, frame_y + 3] (or equivalently, +1 to min coordinates, -1 to max coordinates). This centering is geometric and consistent—no overlaps or deviations.
   - Consistency: Present in every train input and output (4–6 such pairs per example). No single frame exists without this exact nested inner, and no inner is nested this way without a single frame.

2. **Multi-hole frame containment (holes>1 frames interact with multiple inner solids via loose enclosure)**:
   - Components: Red or Maroon frame (holes=n where n>1, pixels=16*n, bbox rectangular >4x4, not full-canvas) + exactly n inner solids (each holes=0, pixels=9, bbox 2x2 square, any color).
   - Interaction: The frame contains exactly n "loose" inner solids (not paired with their own single frame), with each inner's bbox fully contained within the multi-frame's bbox (containment effect). Inners are positioned variably inside (not required to be centered or equally spaced; no fixed offset). Hole count directly determines the number of contained inners (holes → quantity effect). Pixels scale linearly with holes (pixels = 16 × holes, additive property from single-frame base).
   - Consistency: Observed in input 1, all outputs (1–2 such multi-frames per example where present). No multi-frame has mismatched hole count vs. contained loose inners. Absent in input 3 (no partial multi-frames), but the interaction holds without contradiction where present.

3. **Frame color restriction (color property affects component type)**:
   - Components: All single frames (holes=1) and partial multi-frames (holes>1, non-full bbox).
   - Interaction: Color is restricted to Red or Maroon only (color → type effect). This excludes other colors (e.g., no Yellow or Blue single/multi-frames). Inners nested within (from #1 or #2) never match this color (contrasting fill effect).
   - Consistency: Applies to every single and partial multi-frame across all train inputs and outputs (100% of such frames are Red or Maroon). No exceptions.

4. **Full-canvas frame encompassment (large frame interacts with all other components via global containment)**:
   - Components: Full-canvas frame (holes=variable 4–6, pixels=274–334, bbox always [0,0,21,21], color Yellow/Blue/Light Blue) + all other shapes (single pairs, multi-frames, inners).
   - Interaction: The frame always fully contains the bboxes of all other shapes on the canvas (global positional containment effect). No other shapes extend beyond [0,0,21,21].
   - Consistency: Where present (input 2, output 2, input 3, output 3), it encompasses everything. Absent in input 1 and output 1 (no full-canvas listed, but canvas implied as [0,0,21,21] bound). Hole count and pixel variations (e.g., holes=6 →4? unknown; pixels decrease in output 2 but not 3) have no clear consistent relation to contained elements (e.g., always 8 total inners regardless of holes; relation unknown).

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No irrelevant elements**: Standalone shapes without nesting/containment (none observed) or inconsistent interactions (e.g., the anomalous Yellow holes=0 pixels=10 bbox=[17,0,21,1] in output 2 is contained in a multi-frame but ignored here as it lacks consistent properties across examples—non-square, non-9 pixels, unknown hole effect).
- **No forced connections**: No semantic meanings (e.g., "frame protects inner") or input-output transformations (e.g., color swaps, movements) are identified, as they are not obvious or consistent without solving. Full-canvas holes → inners is unknown (mismatch in counts). Background color (blue input → black output) has no observed shape interaction.
- **Scope**: Only 8 primary figures per example (pairs or multi + full when present). Positions vary irregularly but always respect containment rules above. No edge/hole/silhouette effects on movement observed consistently.

[2025-09-30 19:18:31] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
No helpful functions were provided in this attempt, as the program only copies the grid without any extraction or manipulation. Future attempts should include:

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 0/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

### List of Interconnected Properties and Components

The following are only obvious, consistent interactions and connections observed across **all** train examples (inputs and outputs). These are limited to properties like nesting, positional relationships, hole counts affecting containment, and color restrictions on specific component types. Only elements with clear, direct interactions (e.g., one property affecting another's position or count) are included. Irrelevant or isolated elements (e.g., standalone shapes without nesting or containment) are excluded. Inconsistent or unclear relations (e.g., exact pixel counts for full-canvas shapes, or full-canvas hole counts relating to inners) are noted as unknown rather than explained. No high-level puzzle solution or transformation rules are inferred or provided.

1. **Single-frame nesting (holes=1 frames interact with inner solids via precise centering)**:
   - Components: Red or Maroon frame (holes=1, pixels=16, bbox always 4x4 square) + one inner solid (holes=0, pixels=9, bbox always 2x2 square, any color except matching the frame's Red/Maroon).
   - Interaction: The frame always contains exactly one inner solid. The inner's position is directly determined by the frame's position (positional offset effect): inner_bbox = [frame_x + 1, frame_y + 1, frame_x + 3, frame_y + 3] (or equivalently, +1 to min coordinates, -1 to max coordinates). This centering is geometric and consistent—no overlaps or deviations.
   - Consistency: Present in every train input and output (4–6 such pairs per example). No single frame exists without this exact nested inner, and no inner is nested this way without a single frame.

2. **Multi-hole frame containment (holes>1 frames interact with multiple inner solids via loose enclosure)**:
   - Components: Red or Maroon frame (holes=n where n>1, pixels=16*n, bbox rectangular >4x4, not full-canvas) + exactly n inner solids (each holes=0, pixels=9, bbox 2x2 square, any color).
   - Interaction: The frame contains exactly n "loose" inner solids (not paired with their own single frame), with each inner's bbox fully contained within the multi-frame's bbox (containment effect). Inners are positioned variably inside (not required to be centered or equally spaced; no fixed offset). Hole count directly determines the number of contained inners (holes → quantity effect). Pixels scale linearly with holes (pixels = 16 × holes, additive property from single-frame base).
   - Consistency: Observed in input 1, all outputs (1–2 such multi-frames per example where present). No multi-frame has mismatched hole count vs. contained loose inners. Absent in input 3 (no partial multi-frames), but the interaction holds without contradiction where present.

3. **Frame color restriction (color property affects component type)**:
   - Components: All single frames (holes=1) and partial multi-frames (holes>1, non-full bbox).
   - Interaction: Color is restricted to Red or Maroon only (color → type effect). This excludes other colors (e.g., no Yellow or Blue single/multi-frames). Inners nested within (from #1 or #2) never match this color (contrasting fill effect).
   - Consistency: Applies to every single and partial multi-frame across all train inputs and outputs (100% of such frames are Red or Maroon). No exceptions.

4. **Full-canvas frame encompassment (large frame interacts with all other components via global containment)**:
   - Components: Full-canvas frame (holes=variable 4–6, pixels=274–334, bbox always [0,0,21,21], color Yellow/Blue/Light Blue) + all other shapes (single pairs, multi-frames, inners).
   - Interaction: The frame always fully contains the bboxes of all other shapes on the canvas (global positional containment effect). No other shapes extend beyond [0,0,21,21].
   - Consistency: Where present (input 2, output 2, input 3, output 3), it encompasses everything. Absent in input 1 and output 1 (no full-canvas listed, but canvas implied as [0,0,21,21] bound). Hole count and pixel variations (e.g., holes=6 →4? unknown; pixels decrease in output 2 but not 3) have no clear consistent relation to contained elements (e.g., always 8 total inners regardless of holes; relation unknown).

### Notes on Exclusions and Unknowns
- **No irrelevant elements**: Standalone shapes without nesting/containment (none observed) or inconsistent interactions (e.g., the anomalous Yellow holes=0 pixels=10 bbox=[17,0,21,1] in output 2 is contained in a multi-frame but ignored here as it lacks consistent properties across examples—non-square, non-9 pixels, unknown hole effect).
- **No forced connections**: No semantic meanings (e.g., "frame protects inner") or input-output transformations (e.g., color swaps, movements) are identified, as they are not obvious or consistent without solving. Full-canvas holes → inners is unknown (mismatch in counts). Background color (blue input → black output) has no observed shape interaction.
- **Scope**: Only 8 primary figures per example (pairs or multi + full when present). Positions vary irregularly but always respect containment rules above. No edge/hole/silhouette effects on movement observed consistently.


Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============

 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

[2025-09-30 19:28:03] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of nested "objects" (connected blobs of numbers, specifically outers made of 2 or 8 containing inner blobs) from an input grid, then rearranging and stacking these objects into a standardized 22x22 output grid with background fill (1 or 9), following rules for positioning, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate a compact, layered composition without overlaps or excessive spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are defined as atomic connected components (blobs) of the same number, excluding background (bg, e.g., 1 or 9); inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob of type 2 or 8, not touching bg or other numbers.
 * Stacking occurs separately for 8-objects (first) and 2-objects (second), sorted by row then column; new stacks start at specific columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position), with vertical shifts (-1 row up) only if the current object's top fully matches the previous stack's bottom in outer material and no overlap.
 * Gap-filling: When stacking adjacently (touching but not overlapping), fill horizontal gaps at the connection row with outer material; prevent horizontal overflows by starting new stacks if width exceeds remaining space (max col 21).
 * Subtleties: Blobs must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right); inners skip if adjacent to multiple outers or non-2/8; placement ignores out-of-bounds but doesn't clip; original min_c influences base column for 2-objects (<9 -> col 12, else 17); all-top-outer and all-prev-bottom checks are crucial for upward shifts but only apply to touching non-new-stacks.
 * Easy-to-miss: Background varies (1 in train, 9 in test); self_num exclusion in adjacency checks; no diagonal connections; objects without valid inners or touching bg are ignored; sorting and current_stack_min_col tracking prevent misalignment in multi-object stacks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve inner/outer numbers exactly; output is always 22x22; handle cases where objects span multiple rows/cols with min/max bounding boxes for placement.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs), successfully extracting nested objects and stacking with shifts/fills.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., row 2 [8,1,1,1,8,...] instead of expected [8,2,2,2,8,...] (1's where 2's should be, suggesting a 2-object was not shifted up or gap not filled properly); row 3/4 similar mismatches with 1's persisting; row 14 has 1's where expected has nothing specified but pattern implies outer extension; overall, stacking logic misapplies upward shifts or adjacency checks for 2-objects, leading to unfilled gaps treated as bg (1).
 * Differences in train 3 are specific to 2-object placements (e.g., a vertical 2-blob in cols 2-4 rows 2-4 is replaced by 1's in generated, indicating failure to detect/place an inner or outer correctly); unknown why 1's appear instead of 2's—possibly flawed all_top_outer check using input g instead of tracking placed state, or incorrect blob adjacency.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and place_group are essential and mostly correct (worked for train 1/2), but place_group's shift_r condition (all_top_outer on input g) is broken for multi-object interactions as it doesn't reflect the evolving output state.
 * touches_bg and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for isolation checks.
 * build_objects is useful for structuring but skips non-2/8, which is correct.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj could be enhanced to avoid overwriting (but doesn't in this case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=9) mostly follows the stacking pattern from train 3 expected, placing 8-objects left/center and 2-objects right, with some nesting (e.g., 4's inside 8's at rows 3-6 cols 0-4; 3's inside 2's at rows 17-20 cols 12-16), and gap-fills visible (e.g., row 2 cols 17-21 as 2's).
 * It does not look fully correct: Several potential misplacements, e.g., row 3 has [8,8,8,8,8,9,...,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] but includes extra 2's in cols 17-21 that might be unfilled gaps or incorrect extension; row 8 has 8's extending into col 10-14 unexpectedly, possibly from a merged stack without proper new_stack trigger; row 16 has 2's in cols 12-16 with 3's, but row 17 shifts to [8,3,3,3,8,...] which aligns but may miss an upward shift similar to train 3 error (3's appear where bg=9 should if not filled).
 * Compared to train 3 expected patterns, test output has analogous issues: Persistent bg (9) where outers should extend (e.g., row 5 col 12-16 as 9's instead of potential 2's); inner 1's in rows 9-11 cols 6-8 inside 8's look correct, but 7's in cols 11-13 may be misplaced if not fully enclosed; overall, stacking seems to start new stacks too early (e.g., 2-objects at col 12 but with overflows), and no upward shifts observed, leading to vertical spacing that doesn't compact touching objects—does not match the tight nesting in train expected (e.g., no -1 row shifts applied).
 * To handle test: Account for bg=9; ensure all_top_outer checks use placed output state, not input g; verify width calculations prevent col>21 overflows by forcing new stacks earlier; test output misses compacting for touching 8/2 groups, resulting in looser layout than expected tight composition.

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:28:03] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of nested "objects" (connected blobs of numbers, specifically outers made of 2 or 8 containing inner blobs) from an input grid, then rearranging and stacking these objects into a standardized 22x22 output grid with background fill (1 or 9), following rules for positioning, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate a compact, layered composition without overlaps or excessive spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are defined as atomic connected components (blobs) of the same number, excluding background (bg, e.g., 1 or 9); inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob of type 2 or 8, not touching bg or other numbers.
 * Stacking occurs separately for 8-objects (first) and 2-objects (second), sorted by row then column; new stacks start at specific columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position), with vertical shifts (-1 row up) only if the current object's top fully matches the previous stack's bottom in outer material and no overlap.
 * Gap-filling: When stacking adjacently (touching but not overlapping), fill horizontal gaps at the connection row with outer material; prevent horizontal overflows by starting new stacks if width exceeds remaining space (max col 21).
 * Subtleties: Blobs must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right); inners skip if adjacent to multiple outers or non-2/8; placement ignores out-of-bounds but doesn't clip; original min_c influences base column for 2-objects (<9 -> col 12, else 17); all-top-outer and all-prev-bottom checks are crucial for upward shifts but only apply to touching non-new-stacks.
 * Easy-to-miss: Background varies (1 in train, 9 in test); self_num exclusion in adjacency checks; no diagonal connections; objects without valid inners or touching bg are ignored; sorting and current_stack_min_col tracking prevent misalignment in multi-object stacks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve inner/outer numbers exactly; output is always 22x22; handle cases where objects span multiple rows/cols with min/max bounding boxes for placement.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs), successfully extracting nested objects and stacking with shifts/fills.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., row 2 [8,1,1,1,8,...] instead of expected [8,2,2,2,8,...] (1's where 2's should be, suggesting a 2-object was not shifted up or gap not filled properly); row 3/4 similar mismatches with 1's persisting; row 14 has 1's where expected has nothing specified but pattern implies outer extension; overall, stacking logic misapplies upward shifts or adjacency checks for 2-objects, leading to unfilled gaps treated as bg (1).
 * Differences in train 3 are specific to 2-object placements (e.g., a vertical 2-blob in cols 2-4 rows 2-4 is replaced by 1's in generated, indicating failure to detect/place an inner or outer correctly); unknown why 1's appear instead of 2's—possibly flawed all_top_outer check using input g instead of tracking placed state, or incorrect blob adjacency.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and place_group are essential and mostly correct (worked for train 1/2), but place_group's shift_r condition (all_top_outer on input g) is broken for multi-object interactions as it doesn't reflect the evolving output state.
 * touches_bg and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for isolation checks.
 * build_objects is useful for structuring but skips non-2/8, which is correct.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj could be enhanced to avoid overwriting (but doesn't in this case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=9) mostly follows the stacking pattern from train 3 expected, placing 8-objects left/center and 2-objects right, with some nesting (e.g., 4's inside 8's at rows 3-6 cols 0-4; 3's inside 2's at rows 17-20 cols 12-16), and gap-fills visible (e.g., row 2 cols 17-21 as 2's).
 * It does not look fully correct: Several potential misplacements, e.g., row 3 has [8,8,8,8,8,9,...,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] but includes extra 2's in cols 17-21 that might be unfilled gaps or incorrect extension; row 8 has 8's extending into col 10-14 unexpectedly, possibly from a merged stack without proper new_stack trigger; row 16 has 2's in cols 12-16 with 3's, but row 17 shifts to [8,3,3,3,8,...] which aligns but may miss an upward shift similar to train 3 error (3's appear where bg=9 should if not filled).
 * Compared to train 3 expected patterns, test output has analogous issues: Persistent bg (9) where outers should extend (e.g., row 5 col 12-16 as 9's instead of potential 2's); inner 1's in rows 9-11 cols 6-8 inside 8's look correct, but 7's in cols 11-13 may be misplaced if not fully enclosed; overall, stacking seems to start new stacks too early (e.g., 2-objects at col 12 but with overflows), and no upward shifts observed, leading to vertical spacing that doesn't compact touching objects—does not match the tight nesting in train expected (e.g., no -1 row shifts applied).
 * To handle test: Account for bg=9; ensure all_top_outer checks use placed output state, not input g; verify width calculations prevent col>21 overflows by forcing new stacks earlier; test output misses compacting for touching 8/2 groups, resulting in looser layout than expected tight composition.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:33:29] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to parse a grid of numbered cells (representing shapes or blobs) into composite "objects" consisting of outer enclosures (specifically numbers 2 or 8) and their fully enclosed inner blobs, then reassemble these objects in a new output grid by grouping and stacking them horizontally and vertically in designated column ranges, connecting adjacent objects where their edges align to form continuous structures while preserving inner details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the value at grid[0][0] (9 in examples); all non-background connected components of the same number form "atomic blobs" via flood-fill, tracking positions, bounds (min/max row/col), but excluding background-touching blobs for inner detection.
 * Inner blobs must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob (only 2 or 8 qualify as outers), not touch the background, and be adjacent only to that single outer number; multiple adjacents or background contact disqualifies them as inners.
 * Objects are built only from unused outer blobs (2 or 8) that aren't themselves inners; inners are associated per outer via index lists.
 * Placement separates groups by outer number: 8-objects stack starting from column 0 (left side); 2-objects stack starting from column 12 (if original min_c < 9) or 17 (otherwise, suggesting left/middle vs. right-side originals in input).
 * Stacking logic sorts objects by min_r then min_c; attempts vertical connection (shift_r = -1) only if the new object's top row is all outer_num and the previous stack's bottom is all outer_num in overlapping columns; otherwise places at shift_r=0; fills horizontal gaps in the connection row with outer_num if touching without shift.
 * New stacks start if not touching/overlapping previous or if width exceeds remaining columns; updates current max_r, rightmost col, and stack min_col for overlap checks.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency for enclosure checks uses 4-directional (up/down/left/right); blob extraction uses stack-based DFS for efficiency; placement bounds-checks to avoid out-of-grid writes; no rotation or scaling—positions are relative and shifted directly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Inners can be any non-bg/non-outer number (e.g., 1,3,4,6,7); objects preserve exact relative positions including inners; filling gaps only happens on touch without vertical shift; original_min_c determines 2-object column base, implying input layout influences output positioning.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle multiple inners per outer; avoid using background or non-qualifying blobs as objects; ensure no overlap in placement beyond intended connections; track used inners to prevent double-use; sort groups for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right stacking.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, successfully extracting blobs, identifying inners for outers 2/8, building objects, and placing them with stacking logic that connects where tops/bottoms are uniform outer_num.
 * Worked well for simple enclosures and stacking without overlaps; base column logic (0 for 8, 12/17 for 2 based on original position) preserved input-side distinctions.
 * Potential issue in vertical shift check: the all_top_outer check references original g (input grid), but should verify the object's own top row in its positions (not g[obj_min_r], as g may have inners or gaps); this could cause incorrect -1 shifts if input top isn't pure outer.
 * Gap filling only on touch without shift, but may overfill if columns don't align perfectly; no handling for diagonal touches or 8-connectivity.
 * Innermost detection skips bg-touching correctly, but assumes single outer adjacency—may miss complex enclosures with multiple layers.
 * build_objects skips used inners properly, avoiding recursion.
 * Overall, blob extraction and adjacency functions are solid and essential; place_group is core but has subtle bugs in connection checks referencing wrong grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 8-object stacks on the left (columns 0-5, with inners like 4,3,1,7), a central 2-object stack around columns 12-17 (with inners 4,3,6), and a right-side 2-stack around columns 17-21 (with inners 3,6); background 9 fills the rest, with some extensions like row 3-4 2's protruding right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Several placements show incomplete connections, e.g., row 4 has 8,4,4,4,8 but adjacent rows have gaps or misalignments (row 5 has 8,4,4,4,8 but then jumps to 9's); the central 2-stack in rows 1-3 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 0 above it has 2,2,2,2,2 without inner, suggesting failed vertical shift or gap fill—expected seamless stacking if tops/bottoms match.
 * Right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show stacking with inners 6 and 3, but row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 overlapping a previous 2,6,6,6,2 without full connection (gaps in row 17-18), differing from expected by not filling horizontal gaps properly or shifting up.
 * Bottom rows (20-21) have isolated 8's and 9's, but upper rows like 7-8 show wide 8's without inners, possibly correct but the overall structure has jagged edges where smooth connections were expected; unknown why some 2's extend into column 21 in row 3 without support.
 * No obvious missing objects (all numbers 1-8 appear placed), but placements seem shifted incorrectly in vertical stacks, leading to overlaps or gaps not filled with outer_num.

[2025-09-30 19:33:29] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of nested "objects" (connected blobs of numbers, specifically outers made of 2 or 8 containing inner blobs) from an input grid, then rearranging and stacking these objects into a standardized 22x22 output grid with background fill (1 or 9), following rules for positioning, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate a compact, layered composition without overlaps or excessive spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are defined as atomic connected components (blobs) of the same number, excluding background (bg, e.g., 1 or 9); inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob of type 2 or 8, not touching bg or other numbers.
 * Stacking occurs separately for 8-objects (first) and 2-objects (second), sorted by row then column; new stacks start at specific columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position), with vertical shifts (-1 row up) only if the current object's top fully matches the previous stack's bottom in outer material and no overlap.
 * Gap-filling: When stacking adjacently (touching but not overlapping), fill horizontal gaps at the connection row with outer material; prevent horizontal overflows by starting new stacks if width exceeds remaining space (max col 21).
 * Subtleties: Blobs must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right); inners skip if adjacent to multiple outers or non-2/8; placement ignores out-of-bounds but doesn't clip; original min_c influences base column for 2-objects (<9 -> col 12, else 17); all-top-outer and all-prev-bottom checks are crucial for upward shifts but only apply to touching non-new-stacks.
 * Easy-to-miss: Background varies (1 in train, 9 in test); self_num exclusion in adjacency checks; no diagonal connections; objects without valid inners or touching bg are ignored; sorting and current_stack_min_col tracking prevent misalignment in multi-object stacks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve inner/outer numbers exactly; output is always 22x22; handle cases where objects span multiple rows/cols with min/max bounding boxes for placement.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs), successfully extracting nested objects and stacking with shifts/fills.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., row 2 [8,1,1,1,8,...] instead of expected [8,2,2,2,8,...] (1's where 2's should be, suggesting a 2-object was not shifted up or gap not filled properly); row 3/4 similar mismatches with 1's persisting; row 14 has 1's where expected has nothing specified but pattern implies outer extension; overall, stacking logic misapplies upward shifts or adjacency checks for 2-objects, leading to unfilled gaps treated as bg (1).
 * Differences in train 3 are specific to 2-object placements (e.g., a vertical 2-blob in cols 2-4 rows 2-4 is replaced by 1's in generated, indicating failure to detect/place an inner or outer correctly); unknown why 1's appear instead of 2's—possibly flawed all_top_outer check using input g instead of tracking placed state, or incorrect blob adjacency.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and place_group are essential and mostly correct (worked for train 1/2), but place_group's shift_r condition (all_top_outer on input g) is broken for multi-object interactions as it doesn't reflect the evolving output state.
 * touches_bg and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for isolation checks.
 * build_objects is useful for structuring but skips non-2/8, which is correct.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj could be enhanced to avoid overwriting (but doesn't in this case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=9) mostly follows the stacking pattern from train 3 expected, placing 8-objects left/center and 2-objects right, with some nesting (e.g., 4's inside 8's at rows 3-6 cols 0-4; 3's inside 2's at rows 17-20 cols 12-16), and gap-fills visible (e.g., row 2 cols 17-21 as 2's).
 * It does not look fully correct: Several potential misplacements, e.g., row 3 has [8,8,8,8,8,9,...,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] but includes extra 2's in cols 17-21 that might be unfilled gaps or incorrect extension; row 8 has 8's extending into col 10-14 unexpectedly, possibly from a merged stack without proper new_stack trigger; row 16 has 2's in cols 12-16 with 3's, but row 17 shifts to [8,3,3,3,8,...] which aligns but may miss an upward shift similar to train 3 error (3's appear where bg=9 should if not filled).
 * Compared to train 3 expected patterns, test output has analogous issues: Persistent bg (9) where outers should extend (e.g., row 5 col 12-16 as 9's instead of potential 2's); inner 1's in rows 9-11 cols 6-8 inside 8's look correct, but 7's in cols 11-13 may be misplaced if not fully enclosed; overall, stacking seems to start new stacks too early (e.g., 2-objects at col 12 but with overflows), and no upward shifts observed, leading to vertical spacing that doesn't compact touching objects—does not match the tight nesting in train expected (e.g., no -1 row shifts applied).
 * To handle test: Account for bg=9; ensure all_top_outer checks use placed output state, not input g; verify width calculations prevent col>21 overflows by forcing new stacks earlier; test output misses compacting for touching 8/2 groups, resulting in looser layout than expected tight composition.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to parse a grid of numbered cells (representing shapes or blobs) into composite "objects" consisting of outer enclosures (specifically numbers 2 or 8) and their fully enclosed inner blobs, then reassemble these objects in a new output grid by grouping and stacking them horizontally and vertically in designated column ranges, connecting adjacent objects where their edges align to form continuous structures while preserving inner details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the value at grid[0][0] (9 in examples); all non-background connected components of the same number form "atomic blobs" via flood-fill, tracking positions, bounds (min/max row/col), but excluding background-touching blobs for inner detection.
 * Inner blobs must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob (only 2 or 8 qualify as outers), not touch the background, and be adjacent only to that single outer number; multiple adjacents or background contact disqualifies them as inners.
 * Objects are built only from unused outer blobs (2 or 8) that aren't themselves inners; inners are associated per outer via index lists.
 * Placement separates groups by outer number: 8-objects stack starting from column 0 (left side); 2-objects stack starting from column 12 (if original min_c < 9) or 17 (otherwise, suggesting left/middle vs. right-side originals in input).
 * Stacking logic sorts objects by min_r then min_c; attempts vertical connection (shift_r = -1) only if the new object's top row is all outer_num and the previous stack's bottom is all outer_num in overlapping columns; otherwise places at shift_r=0; fills horizontal gaps in the connection row with outer_num if touching without shift.
 * New stacks start if not touching/overlapping previous or if width exceeds remaining columns; updates current max_r, rightmost col, and stack min_col for overlap checks.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency for enclosure checks uses 4-directional (up/down/left/right); blob extraction uses stack-based DFS for efficiency; placement bounds-checks to avoid out-of-grid writes; no rotation or scaling—positions are relative and shifted directly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Inners can be any non-bg/non-outer number (e.g., 1,3,4,6,7); objects preserve exact relative positions including inners; filling gaps only happens on touch without vertical shift; original_min_c determines 2-object column base, implying input layout influences output positioning.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle multiple inners per outer; avoid using background or non-qualifying blobs as objects; ensure no overlap in placement beyond intended connections; track used inners to prevent double-use; sort groups for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right stacking.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, successfully extracting blobs, identifying inners for outers 2/8, building objects, and placing them with stacking logic that connects where tops/bottoms are uniform outer_num.
 * Worked well for simple enclosures and stacking without overlaps; base column logic (0 for 8, 12/17 for 2 based on original position) preserved input-side distinctions.
 * Potential issue in vertical shift check: the all_top_outer check references original g (input grid), but should verify the object's own top row in its positions (not g[obj_min_r], as g may have inners or gaps); this could cause incorrect -1 shifts if input top isn't pure outer.
 * Gap filling only on touch without shift, but may overfill if columns don't align perfectly; no handling for diagonal touches or 8-connectivity.
 * Innermost detection skips bg-touching correctly, but assumes single outer adjacency—may miss complex enclosures with multiple layers.
 * build_objects skips used inners properly, avoiding recursion.
 * Overall, blob extraction and adjacency functions are solid and essential; place_group is core but has subtle bugs in connection checks referencing wrong grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 8-object stacks on the left (columns 0-5, with inners like 4,3,1,7), a central 2-object stack around columns 12-17 (with inners 4,3,6), and a right-side 2-stack around columns 17-21 (with inners 3,6); background 9 fills the rest, with some extensions like row 3-4 2's protruding right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Several placements show incomplete connections, e.g., row 4 has 8,4,4,4,8 but adjacent rows have gaps or misalignments (row 5 has 8,4,4,4,8 but then jumps to 9's); the central 2-stack in rows 1-3 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 0 above it has 2,2,2,2,2 without inner, suggesting failed vertical shift or gap fill—expected seamless stacking if tops/bottoms match.
 * Right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show stacking with inners 6 and 3, but row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 overlapping a previous 2,6,6,6,2 without full connection (gaps in row 17-18), differing from expected by not filling horizontal gaps properly or shifting up.
 * Bottom rows (20-21) have isolated 8's and 9's, but upper rows like 7-8 show wide 8's without inners, possibly correct but the overall structure has jagged edges where smooth connections were expected; unknown why some 2's extend into column 21 in row 3 without support.
 * No obvious missing objects (all numbers 1-8 appear placed), but placements seem shifted incorrectly in vertical stacks, leading to overlaps or gaps not filled with outer_num.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

[2025-09-30 19:43:04] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing shapes or "objects" (like containers or blobs formed by connected cells of the same number), extracting atomic connected components (blobs), identifying composite objects (e.g., an outer shell of 2 or 8 containing an inner filling like 1,3,4,5,6,9), and then reassembling these objects in a new output grid by stacking them in columns based on their outer type (8 on the left, 2 on the right), simulating gravity-like placement where objects stack vertically, connect if tops and bottoms align solidly, and start new stacks if needed, while preserving inner/outer distinctions and handling open tops specially.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically 0 but can vary (e.g., 1 in train 3, 4 or 9 in others); always detect it from g[0][0] and ignore it for blob extraction.
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of the same non-bg number; track min/max row/col for bounding boxes and positions for adjacency checks.
 * Objects are either simple (outer 2 or 8 with no inner) or composite (inner blob like 5 adjacent to outer 2/8); only consider inners adjacent to exactly one outer type (prioritize max adjacency count for 2/8), and mark "is_open_top" if the inner's top row is fully bg-exposed (for special placement rules like filling with outer on open tops).
 * Stacking rules: Sort objects by min_r then min_c; place in groups by outer_num (8 first at col 0, then 2 at cols 12 or 17 based on original position <9 or not); for each object, check if it touches/overlaps previous stack (is_touch if min_r == current_max_r +1, is_overlap if min_r <= current_max_r); if connectable (solid top on new obj + solid bottom on previous stack), shift up by -1 row; otherwise, place at row 0 or start new stack; fill gaps horizontally with outer_num if touching without shifting; track current_max_r, current_right, and stack_min_col to prevent overflow (grid cols=22).
 * Subtle placement: In place_obj, for open-top inners, fill top inner row with outer_num if shifted; ensure out grid starts as all bg; only place 2/8 outers, ignore others unless inner.
 * Easy to miss: Adjacency for building objects requires checking all neighbor cells of inner positions for outer nums (2/8), counting touches; multiple inners can merge to one outer if touching same outer blob; solid_top check must verify entire top row of obj is outer_num (or open-top condition); bottom solid check scans previous row's relevant cols for outer_num; new stacks for 2 use different base cols (12 if original_min_c <9, else 17) to separate left/right groups; prevent out-of-bounds placement; preserve exact shapes without rotation or scaling.
 * Physics-like stacking: Objects "fall" to row 0 initially but shift up only if fully supportable; if width causes overflow, force new stack; after placement, update current_max_r/max_c globally per group.
 * Grid size: Always 22x22? Inputs are lists of 22 lists with 22 ints; output same size, all bg init.
 * Other: No diagonals for connectivity; used set prevents reprocessing blobs; sort objects before placing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds some composite objects (e.g., 5 inside 8, 4 inside 8), grouping by outer_num (8 and 2) and attempting stacking with shifts/fills.
 * What worked: Basic connected component detection via extract_atomic_blobs; adjacency checks for inners/outers; initialization of out as bg; sorting objects for placement order; base column logic for 2's (12/17 split); some gap filling and open-top handling.
 * What didn't work: Stacking logic buggy—e.g., in train 1, 3's placed separately instead of stacking under previous 8's (expected connects 3's to row 6 under 8's, but generated keeps them detached at row 8); open_top detection assumes bg=0 (fails if bg=1/4/9); solid_top/is_solid_top often false-negatives, preventing shifts (e.g., train 1 row 6 expected has 3's shifted up but generated doesn't); bottom check all_prev_bottom scans wrong range or misses partial supports; in train 2, 3's and 6's misaligned (generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected shifts them right/under; row 19 expected has 6's shifted up into 8's but generated doesn't); train 3 completely wrong layout (generated keeps original-ish positions with 1's as bg? but expected rotates/stacks 2's/3's/6's vertically on right, fills left with 1's); place_obj overwrites inners incorrectly on shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom 4's have wrong inner placement); new_stack detection too aggressive, causing unnecessary side-by-side instead of vertical stacking; candidates in build_objects only check 2/8 but may miss if inner touches other nums first; used set misses multi-blob merges.
 * Train 1: Generated has detached 3's at rows 8-10 (expected stacked at row 6 under 8's); bottom 4's stacked wrong (generated row 17 has 4's but expected row 17 has 3's? Wait, no—expected row 17: 2,4,4,4,2 but generated has 2,0,0,0,2—unknown why zeros, perhaps no inner detected); 9's misplaced in right stack.
 * Train 2: Generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected empty/ shifted; row 19 expected 4,4,4,... with 6's up but generated has 2,2,2,... no shift; row 6 generated full 4's bottom but expected partial.
 * Train 3: Generated mostly preserves input layout with 1's as fill/bg but expected major rearrangement (e.g., top 2's become right stack, 6's under 8's on left, 3's/4's/5's stacked vertically); unknown why no stacking occurs—perhaps bg=1 confuses extraction.
 * Function `is_solid_top` is helpful but buggy (hardcodes outer_num check, misses open_top for non-row0 mins); `place_group` core but flawed in shift_r logic (only -1 or 0, no full gravity drop; all_prev_bottom assumes full outer_num span but partial supports possible); `place_obj` useful for pos shifting but inner placement conditional is_open_top + r==inner_min_r fails if shifted.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 9 as a filler/bg (spreading everywhere) but places 8/2 structures partially, with misalignments like 4's not stacking under 8's properly (rows 3-5: 8's over 9's, expected likely shifts 4's up); right side 3's at rows 17-20 detached/spread into 9's (expected vertical stack like train 1/2); top rows have 9's overwriting potential outers; 1's tiny blob at rows 7-10 misplaced/not extracted as inner; overall no clear left-8/right-2 columns, gaps filled wrong (e.g., row 15: 2,9,9,9,2 instead of solid 2's); looks like bg detection works (9?) but stacking fails entirely, similar to train 3—probably open_top or solid checks broken for this bg/input shapes; does not match expected physics-stacking (e.g., 3's should stack under previous, not float).

=== Stage Python Generator With Feedback) ===
[2025-09-30 19:43:04] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing shapes or "objects" (like containers or blobs formed by connected cells of the same number), extracting atomic connected components (blobs), identifying composite objects (e.g., an outer shell of 2 or 8 containing an inner filling like 1,3,4,5,6,9), and then reassembling these objects in a new output grid by stacking them in columns based on their outer type (8 on the left, 2 on the right), simulating gravity-like placement where objects stack vertically, connect if tops and bottoms align solidly, and start new stacks if needed, while preserving inner/outer distinctions and handling open tops specially.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically 0 but can vary (e.g., 1 in train 3, 4 or 9 in others); always detect it from g[0][0] and ignore it for blob extraction.
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of the same non-bg number; track min/max row/col for bounding boxes and positions for adjacency checks.
 * Objects are either simple (outer 2 or 8 with no inner) or composite (inner blob like 5 adjacent to outer 2/8); only consider inners adjacent to exactly one outer type (prioritize max adjacency count for 2/8), and mark "is_open_top" if the inner's top row is fully bg-exposed (for special placement rules like filling with outer on open tops).
 * Stacking rules: Sort objects by min_r then min_c; place in groups by outer_num (8 first at col 0, then 2 at cols 12 or 17 based on original position <9 or not); for each object, check if it touches/overlaps previous stack (is_touch if min_r == current_max_r +1, is_overlap if min_r <= current_max_r); if connectable (solid top on new obj + solid bottom on previous stack), shift up by -1 row; otherwise, place at row 0 or start new stack; fill gaps horizontally with outer_num if touching without shifting; track current_max_r, current_right, and stack_min_col to prevent overflow (grid cols=22).
 * Subtle placement: In place_obj, for open-top inners, fill top inner row with outer_num if shifted; ensure out grid starts as all bg; only place 2/8 outers, ignore others unless inner.
 * Easy to miss: Adjacency for building objects requires checking all neighbor cells of inner positions for outer nums (2/8), counting touches; multiple inners can merge to one outer if touching same outer blob; solid_top check must verify entire top row of obj is outer_num (or open-top condition); bottom solid check scans previous row's relevant cols for outer_num; new stacks for 2 use different base cols (12 if original_min_c <9, else 17) to separate left/right groups; prevent out-of-bounds placement; preserve exact shapes without rotation or scaling.
 * Physics-like stacking: Objects "fall" to row 0 initially but shift up only if fully supportable; if width causes overflow, force new stack; after placement, update current_max_r/max_c globally per group.
 * Grid size: Always 22x22? Inputs are lists of 22 lists with 22 ints; output same size, all bg init.
 * Other: No diagonals for connectivity; used set prevents reprocessing blobs; sort objects before placing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds some composite objects (e.g., 5 inside 8, 4 inside 8), grouping by outer_num (8 and 2) and attempting stacking with shifts/fills.
 * What worked: Basic connected component detection via extract_atomic_blobs; adjacency checks for inners/outers; initialization of out as bg; sorting objects for placement order; base column logic for 2's (12/17 split); some gap filling and open-top handling.
 * What didn't work: Stacking logic buggy—e.g., in train 1, 3's placed separately instead of stacking under previous 8's (expected connects 3's to row 6 under 8's, but generated keeps them detached at row 8); open_top detection assumes bg=0 (fails if bg=1/4/9); solid_top/is_solid_top often false-negatives, preventing shifts (e.g., train 1 row 6 expected has 3's shifted up but generated doesn't); bottom check all_prev_bottom scans wrong range or misses partial supports; in train 2, 3's and 6's misaligned (generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected shifts them right/under; row 19 expected has 6's shifted up into 8's but generated doesn't); train 3 completely wrong layout (generated keeps original-ish positions with 1's as bg? but expected rotates/stacks 2's/3's/6's vertically on right, fills left with 1's); place_obj overwrites inners incorrectly on shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom 4's have wrong inner placement); new_stack detection too aggressive, causing unnecessary side-by-side instead of vertical stacking; candidates in build_objects only check 2/8 but may miss if inner touches other nums first; used set misses multi-blob merges.
 * Train 1: Generated has detached 3's at rows 8-10 (expected stacked at row 6 under 8's); bottom 4's stacked wrong (generated row 17 has 4's but expected row 17 has 3's? Wait, no—expected row 17: 2,4,4,4,2 but generated has 2,0,0,0,2—unknown why zeros, perhaps no inner detected); 9's misplaced in right stack.
 * Train 2: Generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected empty/ shifted; row 19 expected 4,4,4,... with 6's up but generated has 2,2,2,... no shift; row 6 generated full 4's bottom but expected partial.
 * Train 3: Generated mostly preserves input layout with 1's as fill/bg but expected major rearrangement (e.g., top 2's become right stack, 6's under 8's on left, 3's/4's/5's stacked vertically); unknown why no stacking occurs—perhaps bg=1 confuses extraction.
 * Function `is_solid_top` is helpful but buggy (hardcodes outer_num check, misses open_top for non-row0 mins); `place_group` core but flawed in shift_r logic (only -1 or 0, no full gravity drop; all_prev_bottom assumes full outer_num span but partial supports possible); `place_obj` useful for pos shifting but inner placement conditional is_open_top + r==inner_min_r fails if shifted.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 9 as a filler/bg (spreading everywhere) but places 8/2 structures partially, with misalignments like 4's not stacking under 8's properly (rows 3-5: 8's over 9's, expected likely shifts 4's up); right side 3's at rows 17-20 detached/spread into 9's (expected vertical stack like train 1/2); top rows have 9's overwriting potential outers; 1's tiny blob at rows 7-10 misplaced/not extracted as inner; overall no clear left-8/right-2 columns, gaps filled wrong (e.g., row 15: 2,9,9,9,2 instead of solid 2's); looks like bg detection works (9?) but stacking fails entirely, similar to train 3—probably open_top or solid checks broken for this bg/input shapes; does not match expected physics-stacking (e.g., 3's should stack under previous, not float).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of nested "objects" (connected blobs of numbers, specifically outers made of 2 or 8 containing inner blobs) from an input grid, then rearranging and stacking these objects into a standardized 22x22 output grid with background fill (1 or 9), following rules for positioning, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate a compact, layered composition without overlaps or excessive spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are defined as atomic connected components (blobs) of the same number, excluding background (bg, e.g., 1 or 9); inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob of type 2 or 8, not touching bg or other numbers.
 * Stacking occurs separately for 8-objects (first) and 2-objects (second), sorted by row then column; new stacks start at specific columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position), with vertical shifts (-1 row up) only if the current object's top fully matches the previous stack's bottom in outer material and no overlap.
 * Gap-filling: When stacking adjacently (touching but not overlapping), fill horizontal gaps at the connection row with outer material; prevent horizontal overflows by starting new stacks if width exceeds remaining space (max col 21).
 * Subtleties: Blobs must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right); inners skip if adjacent to multiple outers or non-2/8; placement ignores out-of-bounds but doesn't clip; original min_c influences base column for 2-objects (<9 -> col 12, else 17); all-top-outer and all-prev-bottom checks are crucial for upward shifts but only apply to touching non-new-stacks.
 * Easy-to-miss: Background varies (1 in train, 9 in test); self_num exclusion in adjacency checks; no diagonal connections; objects without valid inners or touching bg are ignored; sorting and current_stack_min_col tracking prevent misalignment in multi-object stacks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve inner/outer numbers exactly; output is always 22x22; handle cases where objects span multiple rows/cols with min/max bounding boxes for placement.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs), successfully extracting nested objects and stacking with shifts/fills.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., row 2 [8,1,1,1,8,...] instead of expected [8,2,2,2,8,...] (1's where 2's should be, suggesting a 2-object was not shifted up or gap not filled properly); row 3/4 similar mismatches with 1's persisting; row 14 has 1's where expected has nothing specified but pattern implies outer extension; overall, stacking logic misapplies upward shifts or adjacency checks for 2-objects, leading to unfilled gaps treated as bg (1).
 * Differences in train 3 are specific to 2-object placements (e.g., a vertical 2-blob in cols 2-4 rows 2-4 is replaced by 1's in generated, indicating failure to detect/place an inner or outer correctly); unknown why 1's appear instead of 2's—possibly flawed all_top_outer check using input g instead of tracking placed state, or incorrect blob adjacency.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and place_group are essential and mostly correct (worked for train 1/2), but place_group's shift_r condition (all_top_outer on input g) is broken for multi-object interactions as it doesn't reflect the evolving output state.
 * touches_bg and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for isolation checks.
 * build_objects is useful for structuring but skips non-2/8, which is correct.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj could be enhanced to avoid overwriting (but doesn't in this case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=9) mostly follows the stacking pattern from train 3 expected, placing 8-objects left/center and 2-objects right, with some nesting (e.g., 4's inside 8's at rows 3-6 cols 0-4; 3's inside 2's at rows 17-20 cols 12-16), and gap-fills visible (e.g., row 2 cols 17-21 as 2's).
 * It does not look fully correct: Several potential misplacements, e.g., row 3 has [8,8,8,8,8,9,...,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] but includes extra 2's in cols 17-21 that might be unfilled gaps or incorrect extension; row 8 has 8's extending into col 10-14 unexpectedly, possibly from a merged stack without proper new_stack trigger; row 16 has 2's in cols 12-16 with 3's, but row 17 shifts to [8,3,3,3,8,...] which aligns but may miss an upward shift similar to train 3 error (3's appear where bg=9 should if not filled).
 * Compared to train 3 expected patterns, test output has analogous issues: Persistent bg (9) where outers should extend (e.g., row 5 col 12-16 as 9's instead of potential 2's); inner 1's in rows 9-11 cols 6-8 inside 8's look correct, but 7's in cols 11-13 may be misplaced if not fully enclosed; overall, stacking seems to start new stacks too early (e.g., 2-objects at col 12 but with overflows), and no upward shifts observed, leading to vertical spacing that doesn't compact touching objects—does not match the tight nesting in train expected (e.g., no -1 row shifts applied).
 * To handle test: Account for bg=9; ensure all_top_outer checks use placed output state, not input g; verify width calculations prevent col>21 overflows by forcing new stacks earlier; test output misses compacting for touching 8/2 groups, resulting in looser layout than expected tight composition.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to parse a grid of numbered cells (representing shapes or blobs) into composite "objects" consisting of outer enclosures (specifically numbers 2 or 8) and their fully enclosed inner blobs, then reassemble these objects in a new output grid by grouping and stacking them horizontally and vertically in designated column ranges, connecting adjacent objects where their edges align to form continuous structures while preserving inner details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the value at grid[0][0] (9 in examples); all non-background connected components of the same number form "atomic blobs" via flood-fill, tracking positions, bounds (min/max row/col), but excluding background-touching blobs for inner detection.
 * Inner blobs must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob (only 2 or 8 qualify as outers), not touch the background, and be adjacent only to that single outer number; multiple adjacents or background contact disqualifies them as inners.
 * Objects are built only from unused outer blobs (2 or 8) that aren't themselves inners; inners are associated per outer via index lists.
 * Placement separates groups by outer number: 8-objects stack starting from column 0 (left side); 2-objects stack starting from column 12 (if original min_c < 9) or 17 (otherwise, suggesting left/middle vs. right-side originals in input).
 * Stacking logic sorts objects by min_r then min_c; attempts vertical connection (shift_r = -1) only if the new object's top row is all outer_num and the previous stack's bottom is all outer_num in overlapping columns; otherwise places at shift_r=0; fills horizontal gaps in the connection row with outer_num if touching without shift.
 * New stacks start if not touching/overlapping previous or if width exceeds remaining columns; updates current max_r, rightmost col, and stack min_col for overlap checks.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency for enclosure checks uses 4-directional (up/down/left/right); blob extraction uses stack-based DFS for efficiency; placement bounds-checks to avoid out-of-grid writes; no rotation or scaling—positions are relative and shifted directly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Inners can be any non-bg/non-outer number (e.g., 1,3,4,6,7); objects preserve exact relative positions including inners; filling gaps only happens on touch without vertical shift; original_min_c determines 2-object column base, implying input layout influences output positioning.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle multiple inners per outer; avoid using background or non-qualifying blobs as objects; ensure no overlap in placement beyond intended connections; track used inners to prevent double-use; sort groups for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right stacking.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, successfully extracting blobs, identifying inners for outers 2/8, building objects, and placing them with stacking logic that connects where tops/bottoms are uniform outer_num.
 * Worked well for simple enclosures and stacking without overlaps; base column logic (0 for 8, 12/17 for 2 based on original position) preserved input-side distinctions.
 * Potential issue in vertical shift check: the all_top_outer check references original g (input grid), but should verify the object's own top row in its positions (not g[obj_min_r], as g may have inners or gaps); this could cause incorrect -1 shifts if input top isn't pure outer.
 * Gap filling only on touch without shift, but may overfill if columns don't align perfectly; no handling for diagonal touches or 8-connectivity.
 * Innermost detection skips bg-touching correctly, but assumes single outer adjacency—may miss complex enclosures with multiple layers.
 * build_objects skips used inners properly, avoiding recursion.
 * Overall, blob extraction and adjacency functions are solid and essential; place_group is core but has subtle bugs in connection checks referencing wrong grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 8-object stacks on the left (columns 0-5, with inners like 4,3,1,7), a central 2-object stack around columns 12-17 (with inners 4,3,6), and a right-side 2-stack around columns 17-21 (with inners 3,6); background 9 fills the rest, with some extensions like row 3-4 2's protruding right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Several placements show incomplete connections, e.g., row 4 has 8,4,4,4,8 but adjacent rows have gaps or misalignments (row 5 has 8,4,4,4,8 but then jumps to 9's); the central 2-stack in rows 1-3 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 0 above it has 2,2,2,2,2 without inner, suggesting failed vertical shift or gap fill—expected seamless stacking if tops/bottoms match.
 * Right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show stacking with inners 6 and 3, but row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 overlapping a previous 2,6,6,6,2 without full connection (gaps in row 17-18), differing from expected by not filling horizontal gaps properly or shifting up.
 * Bottom rows (20-21) have isolated 8's and 9's, but upper rows like 7-8 show wide 8's without inners, possibly correct but the overall structure has jagged edges where smooth connections were expected; unknown why some 2's extend into column 21 in row 3 without support.
 * No obvious missing objects (all numbers 1-8 appear placed), but placements seem shifted incorrectly in vertical stacks, leading to overlaps or gaps not filled with outer_num.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.

[2025-09-30 19:49:38] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of numbers representing colored shapes or blobs on a background (9), extracting atomic connected components, identifying composite "objects" consisting of outer blobs (specifically numbers 2 or 8) that fully enclose inner blobs without the inners touching the background, and then rearranging these objects into a new output grid by grouping similar outers, sorting them spatially, and stacking them horizontally in designated columns with rules for vertical alignment, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate physical stacking or assembly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected regions of the same number (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding the background (9).
 * Only outers with number 2 or 8 are considered for objects; inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one such outer, not touch the background, and be adjacent to it.
 * Objects may have multiple inners, but inners cannot themselves be outers (no nesting beyond one level).
 * In placement, groups of objects with the same outer number are sorted by their original min_r then min_c.
 * Stacking logic: Objects are placed starting in base columns (0 for 8; 12 if original min_c <9 else 17 for 2), forming vertical stacks if they touch or overlap the previous object's bottom; new stacks start if no connection.
 * Subtle shifting: If an object touches the previous stack's bottom row and its own top row is fully contiguous (no holes in the top edge) while the previous bottom is fully filled with the outer number in the relevant columns, shift the new object up by 1 row (shift_r = -1) to simulate embedding or tight stacking.
 * Gap filling: When stacking without upward shift (shift_r=0) and touching, fill any horizontal gaps between the previous right edge and new object's left with the outer number to connect them seamlessly.
 * Bounds checking: Placements clip to grid size; no overwriting if out of bounds, but this can lead to partial objects if miscalculated.
 * Order of placement: Process 8-groups first, then 2-groups, on a fresh background-filled grid.
 * Easy to miss: Original position influences base column for 2's (left or right side based on min_c <9), suggesting the puzzle simulates a two-sided assembly (e.g., left for one "page", right for another).
 * No rotation or scaling: Objects retain exact relative positions and shapes.
 * Background propagation: Output starts fully as background; only placed pixels are overwritten.
 * Potential for multiple stacks per group if widths cause overflow beyond column 21.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, DefaultDict
from collections import defaultdict

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected neighbors

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform background

def extract_atomic_blobs(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    # Extracts all connected components (blobs) of non-bg numbers, including bounds and positions.
    # Uses DFS with stack for flood-fill; tracks min/max r/c for bounding box.
    # Returns list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), 'min_r', 'max_r', 'min_c', 'max_c'.
    # Helpful for identifying all potential inners and outers without assuming structure.
```

```python
def touches_bg(positions: List[tuple], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    # Checks if any position in the blob (or its 4-neighbors) touches background or grid edge (edge counts as bg touch).
    # Essential for distinguishing enclosed inners from outer-touching or bg-adjacent blobs.

def blobs_adjacent(pos1: List[tuple], pos2: List[tuple]) -> bool:
    # Checks if two blobs share an edge (4-neighbor adjacency between any positions).
    # Used to confirm inner is adjacent to its outer.

def find_inners(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, atomic_blobs: List[Dict]) -> DefaultDict[int, List[int]]:
    # For each non-bg, non-outer blob, checks if it's fully enclosed: touches exactly one outer (2 or 8) via adjacency, no other numbers, no bg touch.
    # Returns dict mapping outer blob index to list of inner blob indices.
    # Key subtlety: Ignores self-num in adjacency check; only considers 2/8 as valid outers.

def build_objects(atomic_blobs: List[Dict], inners_for_outer: DefaultDict[int, List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Builds object dicts for valid outers (2/8 not used as inners), including their inners list, positions, bounds, and original min_c (for placement basing).
    # Filters out inners-as-outer cases to prevent double-use.

def place_obj(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], obj: Dict, shift_r: int, shift_c: int):
    # Places an object (outer + all inners) at shifted position, overwriting output grid cells within bounds.
    # Clips to grid; no error if partial.

def place_group(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], group: List[Dict], outer_num: int):
    # Core placement: Sorts group by original position; iterates to place in stacks.
    # Base col: 0 for 8; for 2, 12 if original_min_c <9 else 17.
    # Detects touch (min_r == prev_max_r +1) or overlap (min_r <= prev_max_r); else new stack.
    # If overflow in current stack, force new stack.
    # Up-shift (-1 row) only if touch, top row fully solid in object, and prev bottom fully outer_num in stack's col range.
    # Post-place fill: If no shift but touch, fill horizontal gap with outer_num at prev_max_r.
    # Updates stack tracking (current_max_r, current_right, current_stack_min_col).
    # Handles multiple objects per group, potential multi-stack.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all three training examples, correctly extracting blobs, identifying inners (e.g., 4 inside 2/8, 1/7 inside 8, 3/6 inside 2), building objects, and placing groups with stacking/shifting/filling, resulting in correct rearrangements.
 * Worked well for simple single-object or basic stacking cases in training, preserving shapes, enclosures, and relative positions while simulating assembly on left (8's) and right (2's) sides.
 * What didn't work: In complex test cases with multiple stacks or wide objects, the gap-filling might overfill (e.g., extending outer_num beyond intended connections), and the up-shift condition could fail if "fully covered" check misses irregular top edges (e.g., if object's top has gaps due to inner protrusion).
 * The base column logic for 2's (12 vs 17 based on original min_c <9) worked for training but might misplace if test has objects originally spanning the threshold ambiguously.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct: accurately finds all blobs without merging different numbers.
 * touches_bg is helpful and precise: correctly identifies enclosed inners by checking positions and neighbors.
 * find_inners is key but subtle: requires exactly one adjacent outer (2/8) and no bg touch; skips if multiple adjacents, preventing wrong enclosures.
 * build_objects correctly avoids using inners as outers, but could miss if an outer has no inners (still valid object).
 * place_group's stacking logic worked for training touches/overlaps but might not handle non-rectangular "full coverage" perfectly (e.g., if prev bottom has holes from prior inners).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the fill logic in place_group could be refined to check for actual gap presence rather than always filling between edges.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates good understanding of blob extraction and object hierarchy, but placement subtleties (shift conditions, fills) may need tuning for irregular shapes in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places objects in a structured way: top-left has an 8-outer with 4-inner (rows 3-7, cols 0-4, shifted/clipped); adjacent 2-group with 4/3-inners stacked around cols 12-17 (rows 0-5); mid-bottom has another 8 with 1/7-inners (rows 8-12, cols 5-15); lower-right has 2-group with 6/3-inners (rows 13-20, cols 17-21), with some fills like extended 2's in row 2 cols 12-21.
 * It makes sense overall: Groups 8's on left/mid, 2's on right, with stacking (e.g., the lower 2's touch and connect without shift, filling gaps with 2's); enclosures preserved (4 inside 2/8, etc.); background 9 elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: In the top 2-group (rows 0-5, cols 12-17+), the 4-inner in row 1 cols 13-15 overlaps the outer 2's but protrudes oddly without full enclosure in output (e.g., row 0 has 2's but no inner below, suggesting missed up-shift or fill); similarly, lower 8-group (rows 16-20, cols 0-4) has 3-inner but row 17 col 1-3 is 3's adjacent to bg 9 without outer cover, implying failed enclosure preservation or clipping error.
 * The right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show good stacking (6-inner enclosed, 3's stacked below with touch-fill), but the base col 17 placement causes slight overflow (e.g., row 15 col 21 is 2, but grid is 22 cols indexed 0-21, so okay, but looks tight).
 * Differences from expected: Expected tighter vertical integration (more up-shifts for embedded looks) and no bg exposure for inners; observed has some loose connections (e.g., row 4 col 17-21 has 2's and 3's but gaps to bg), possibly due to incomplete fill or shift misfire on irregular shapes; also, multiple 3-inners suggest test has complex objects, but output merges stacks suboptimally, leaving horizontal 9's in row 20 cols 12-16 unused.
 * The output preserves counts (e.g., two 8-objects, multiple 2's with varied inners), but positioning feels shifted right for some 2's compared to base logic, hinting at overflow forcing extra stacks without reset.

[2025-09-30 19:49:38] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing shapes or "objects" (like containers or blobs formed by connected cells of the same number), extracting atomic connected components (blobs), identifying composite objects (e.g., an outer shell of 2 or 8 containing an inner filling like 1,3,4,5,6,9), and then reassembling these objects in a new output grid by stacking them in columns based on their outer type (8 on the left, 2 on the right), simulating gravity-like placement where objects stack vertically, connect if tops and bottoms align solidly, and start new stacks if needed, while preserving inner/outer distinctions and handling open tops specially.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically 0 but can vary (e.g., 1 in train 3, 4 or 9 in others); always detect it from g[0][0] and ignore it for blob extraction.
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of the same non-bg number; track min/max row/col for bounding boxes and positions for adjacency checks.
 * Objects are either simple (outer 2 or 8 with no inner) or composite (inner blob like 5 adjacent to outer 2/8); only consider inners adjacent to exactly one outer type (prioritize max adjacency count for 2/8), and mark "is_open_top" if the inner's top row is fully bg-exposed (for special placement rules like filling with outer on open tops).
 * Stacking rules: Sort objects by min_r then min_c; place in groups by outer_num (8 first at col 0, then 2 at cols 12 or 17 based on original position <9 or not); for each object, check if it touches/overlaps previous stack (is_touch if min_r == current_max_r +1, is_overlap if min_r <= current_max_r); if connectable (solid top on new obj + solid bottom on previous stack), shift up by -1 row; otherwise, place at row 0 or start new stack; fill gaps horizontally with outer_num if touching without shifting; track current_max_r, current_right, and stack_min_col to prevent overflow (grid cols=22).
 * Subtle placement: In place_obj, for open-top inners, fill top inner row with outer_num if shifted; ensure out grid starts as all bg; only place 2/8 outers, ignore others unless inner.
 * Easy to miss: Adjacency for building objects requires checking all neighbor cells of inner positions for outer nums (2/8), counting touches; multiple inners can merge to one outer if touching same outer blob; solid_top check must verify entire top row of obj is outer_num (or open-top condition); bottom solid check scans previous row's relevant cols for outer_num; new stacks for 2 use different base cols (12 if original_min_c <9, else 17) to separate left/right groups; prevent out-of-bounds placement; preserve exact shapes without rotation or scaling.
 * Physics-like stacking: Objects "fall" to row 0 initially but shift up only if fully supportable; if width causes overflow, force new stack; after placement, update current_max_r/max_c globally per group.
 * Grid size: Always 22x22? Inputs are lists of 22 lists with 22 ints; output same size, all bg init.
 * Other: No diagonals for connectivity; used set prevents reprocessing blobs; sort objects before placing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds some composite objects (e.g., 5 inside 8, 4 inside 8), grouping by outer_num (8 and 2) and attempting stacking with shifts/fills.
 * What worked: Basic connected component detection via extract_atomic_blobs; adjacency checks for inners/outers; initialization of out as bg; sorting objects for placement order; base column logic for 2's (12/17 split); some gap filling and open-top handling.
 * What didn't work: Stacking logic buggy—e.g., in train 1, 3's placed separately instead of stacking under previous 8's (expected connects 3's to row 6 under 8's, but generated keeps them detached at row 8); open_top detection assumes bg=0 (fails if bg=1/4/9); solid_top/is_solid_top often false-negatives, preventing shifts (e.g., train 1 row 6 expected has 3's shifted up but generated doesn't); bottom check all_prev_bottom scans wrong range or misses partial supports; in train 2, 3's and 6's misaligned (generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected shifts them right/under; row 19 expected has 6's shifted up into 8's but generated doesn't); train 3 completely wrong layout (generated keeps original-ish positions with 1's as bg? but expected rotates/stacks 2's/3's/6's vertically on right, fills left with 1's); place_obj overwrites inners incorrectly on shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom 4's have wrong inner placement); new_stack detection too aggressive, causing unnecessary side-by-side instead of vertical stacking; candidates in build_objects only check 2/8 but may miss if inner touches other nums first; used set misses multi-blob merges.
 * Train 1: Generated has detached 3's at rows 8-10 (expected stacked at row 6 under 8's); bottom 4's stacked wrong (generated row 17 has 4's but expected row 17 has 3's? Wait, no—expected row 17: 2,4,4,4,2 but generated has 2,0,0,0,2—unknown why zeros, perhaps no inner detected); 9's misplaced in right stack.
 * Train 2: Generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected empty/ shifted; row 19 expected 4,4,4,... with 6's up but generated has 2,2,2,... no shift; row 6 generated full 4's bottom but expected partial.
 * Train 3: Generated mostly preserves input layout with 1's as fill/bg but expected major rearrangement (e.g., top 2's become right stack, 6's under 8's on left, 3's/4's/5's stacked vertically); unknown why no stacking occurs—perhaps bg=1 confuses extraction.
 * Function `is_solid_top` is helpful but buggy (hardcodes outer_num check, misses open_top for non-row0 mins); `place_group` core but flawed in shift_r logic (only -1 or 0, no full gravity drop; all_prev_bottom assumes full outer_num span but partial supports possible); `place_obj` useful for pos shifting but inner placement conditional is_open_top + r==inner_min_r fails if shifted.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 9 as a filler/bg (spreading everywhere) but places 8/2 structures partially, with misalignments like 4's not stacking under 8's properly (rows 3-5: 8's over 9's, expected likely shifts 4's up); right side 3's at rows 17-20 detached/spread into 9's (expected vertical stack like train 1/2); top rows have 9's overwriting potential outers; 1's tiny blob at rows 7-10 misplaced/not extracted as inner; overall no clear left-8/right-2 columns, gaps filled wrong (e.g., row 15: 2,9,9,9,2 instead of solid 2's); looks like bg detection works (9?) but stacking fails entirely, similar to train 3—probably open_top or solid checks broken for this bg/input shapes; does not match expected physics-stacking (e.g., 3's should stack under previous, not float).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of nested "objects" (connected blobs of numbers, specifically outers made of 2 or 8 containing inner blobs) from an input grid, then rearranging and stacking these objects into a standardized 22x22 output grid with background fill (1 or 9), following rules for positioning, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate a compact, layered composition without overlaps or excessive spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are defined as atomic connected components (blobs) of the same number, excluding background (bg, e.g., 1 or 9); inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob of type 2 or 8, not touching bg or other numbers.
 * Stacking occurs separately for 8-objects (first) and 2-objects (second), sorted by row then column; new stacks start at specific columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position), with vertical shifts (-1 row up) only if the current object's top fully matches the previous stack's bottom in outer material and no overlap.
 * Gap-filling: When stacking adjacently (touching but not overlapping), fill horizontal gaps at the connection row with outer material; prevent horizontal overflows by starting new stacks if width exceeds remaining space (max col 21).
 * Subtleties: Blobs must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right); inners skip if adjacent to multiple outers or non-2/8; placement ignores out-of-bounds but doesn't clip; original min_c influences base column for 2-objects (<9 -> col 12, else 17); all-top-outer and all-prev-bottom checks are crucial for upward shifts but only apply to touching non-new-stacks.
 * Easy-to-miss: Background varies (1 in train, 9 in test); self_num exclusion in adjacency checks; no diagonal connections; objects without valid inners or touching bg are ignored; sorting and current_stack_min_col tracking prevent misalignment in multi-object stacks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve inner/outer numbers exactly; output is always 22x22; handle cases where objects span multiple rows/cols with min/max bounding boxes for placement.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs), successfully extracting nested objects and stacking with shifts/fills.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., row 2 [8,1,1,1,8,...] instead of expected [8,2,2,2,8,...] (1's where 2's should be, suggesting a 2-object was not shifted up or gap not filled properly); row 3/4 similar mismatches with 1's persisting; row 14 has 1's where expected has nothing specified but pattern implies outer extension; overall, stacking logic misapplies upward shifts or adjacency checks for 2-objects, leading to unfilled gaps treated as bg (1).
 * Differences in train 3 are specific to 2-object placements (e.g., a vertical 2-blob in cols 2-4 rows 2-4 is replaced by 1's in generated, indicating failure to detect/place an inner or outer correctly); unknown why 1's appear instead of 2's—possibly flawed all_top_outer check using input g instead of tracking placed state, or incorrect blob adjacency.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and place_group are essential and mostly correct (worked for train 1/2), but place_group's shift_r condition (all_top_outer on input g) is broken for multi-object interactions as it doesn't reflect the evolving output state.
 * touches_bg and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for isolation checks.
 * build_objects is useful for structuring but skips non-2/8, which is correct.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj could be enhanced to avoid overwriting (but doesn't in this case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=9) mostly follows the stacking pattern from train 3 expected, placing 8-objects left/center and 2-objects right, with some nesting (e.g., 4's inside 8's at rows 3-6 cols 0-4; 3's inside 2's at rows 17-20 cols 12-16), and gap-fills visible (e.g., row 2 cols 17-21 as 2's).
 * It does not look fully correct: Several potential misplacements, e.g., row 3 has [8,8,8,8,8,9,...,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] but includes extra 2's in cols 17-21 that might be unfilled gaps or incorrect extension; row 8 has 8's extending into col 10-14 unexpectedly, possibly from a merged stack without proper new_stack trigger; row 16 has 2's in cols 12-16 with 3's, but row 17 shifts to [8,3,3,3,8,...] which aligns but may miss an upward shift similar to train 3 error (3's appear where bg=9 should if not filled).
 * Compared to train 3 expected patterns, test output has analogous issues: Persistent bg (9) where outers should extend (e.g., row 5 col 12-16 as 9's instead of potential 2's); inner 1's in rows 9-11 cols 6-8 inside 8's look correct, but 7's in cols 11-13 may be misplaced if not fully enclosed; overall, stacking seems to start new stacks too early (e.g., 2-objects at col 12 but with overflows), and no upward shifts observed, leading to vertical spacing that doesn't compact touching objects—does not match the tight nesting in train expected (e.g., no -1 row shifts applied).
 * To handle test: Account for bg=9; ensure all_top_outer checks use placed output state, not input g; verify width calculations prevent col>21 overflows by forcing new stacks earlier; test output misses compacting for touching 8/2 groups, resulting in looser layout than expected tight composition.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to parse a grid of numbered cells (representing shapes or blobs) into composite "objects" consisting of outer enclosures (specifically numbers 2 or 8) and their fully enclosed inner blobs, then reassemble these objects in a new output grid by grouping and stacking them horizontally and vertically in designated column ranges, connecting adjacent objects where their edges align to form continuous structures while preserving inner details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the value at grid[0][0] (9 in examples); all non-background connected components of the same number form "atomic blobs" via flood-fill, tracking positions, bounds (min/max row/col), but excluding background-touching blobs for inner detection.
 * Inner blobs must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob (only 2 or 8 qualify as outers), not touch the background, and be adjacent only to that single outer number; multiple adjacents or background contact disqualifies them as inners.
 * Objects are built only from unused outer blobs (2 or 8) that aren't themselves inners; inners are associated per outer via index lists.
 * Placement separates groups by outer number: 8-objects stack starting from column 0 (left side); 2-objects stack starting from column 12 (if original min_c < 9) or 17 (otherwise, suggesting left/middle vs. right-side originals in input).
 * Stacking logic sorts objects by min_r then min_c; attempts vertical connection (shift_r = -1) only if the new object's top row is all outer_num and the previous stack's bottom is all outer_num in overlapping columns; otherwise places at shift_r=0; fills horizontal gaps in the connection row with outer_num if touching without shift.
 * New stacks start if not touching/overlapping previous or if width exceeds remaining columns; updates current max_r, rightmost col, and stack min_col for overlap checks.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency for enclosure checks uses 4-directional (up/down/left/right); blob extraction uses stack-based DFS for efficiency; placement bounds-checks to avoid out-of-grid writes; no rotation or scaling—positions are relative and shifted directly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Inners can be any non-bg/non-outer number (e.g., 1,3,4,6,7); objects preserve exact relative positions including inners; filling gaps only happens on touch without vertical shift; original_min_c determines 2-object column base, implying input layout influences output positioning.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle multiple inners per outer; avoid using background or non-qualifying blobs as objects; ensure no overlap in placement beyond intended connections; track used inners to prevent double-use; sort groups for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right stacking.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, successfully extracting blobs, identifying inners for outers 2/8, building objects, and placing them with stacking logic that connects where tops/bottoms are uniform outer_num.
 * Worked well for simple enclosures and stacking without overlaps; base column logic (0 for 8, 12/17 for 2 based on original position) preserved input-side distinctions.
 * Potential issue in vertical shift check: the all_top_outer check references original g (input grid), but should verify the object's own top row in its positions (not g[obj_min_r], as g may have inners or gaps); this could cause incorrect -1 shifts if input top isn't pure outer.
 * Gap filling only on touch without shift, but may overfill if columns don't align perfectly; no handling for diagonal touches or 8-connectivity.
 * Innermost detection skips bg-touching correctly, but assumes single outer adjacency—may miss complex enclosures with multiple layers.
 * build_objects skips used inners properly, avoiding recursion.
 * Overall, blob extraction and adjacency functions are solid and essential; place_group is core but has subtle bugs in connection checks referencing wrong grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 8-object stacks on the left (columns 0-5, with inners like 4,3,1,7), a central 2-object stack around columns 12-17 (with inners 4,3,6), and a right-side 2-stack around columns 17-21 (with inners 3,6); background 9 fills the rest, with some extensions like row 3-4 2's protruding right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Several placements show incomplete connections, e.g., row 4 has 8,4,4,4,8 but adjacent rows have gaps or misalignments (row 5 has 8,4,4,4,8 but then jumps to 9's); the central 2-stack in rows 1-3 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 0 above it has 2,2,2,2,2 without inner, suggesting failed vertical shift or gap fill—expected seamless stacking if tops/bottoms match.
 * Right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show stacking with inners 6 and 3, but row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 overlapping a previous 2,6,6,6,2 without full connection (gaps in row 17-18), differing from expected by not filling horizontal gaps properly or shifting up.
 * Bottom rows (20-21) have isolated 8's and 9's, but upper rows like 7-8 show wide 8's without inners, possibly correct but the overall structure has jagged edges where smooth connections were expected; unknown why some 2's extend into column 21 in row 3 without support.
 * No obvious missing objects (all numbers 1-8 appear placed), but placements seem shifted incorrectly in vertical stacks, leading to overlaps or gaps not filled with outer_num.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of numbers representing colored shapes or blobs on a background (9), extracting atomic connected components, identifying composite "objects" consisting of outer blobs (specifically numbers 2 or 8) that fully enclose inner blobs without the inners touching the background, and then rearranging these objects into a new output grid by grouping similar outers, sorting them spatially, and stacking them horizontally in designated columns with rules for vertical alignment, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate physical stacking or assembly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected regions of the same number (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding the background (9).
 * Only outers with number 2 or 8 are considered for objects; inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one such outer, not touch the background, and be adjacent to it.
 * Objects may have multiple inners, but inners cannot themselves be outers (no nesting beyond one level).
 * In placement, groups of objects with the same outer number are sorted by their original min_r then min_c.
 * Stacking logic: Objects are placed starting in base columns (0 for 8; 12 if original min_c <9 else 17 for 2), forming vertical stacks if they touch or overlap the previous object's bottom; new stacks start if no connection.
 * Subtle shifting: If an object touches the previous stack's bottom row and its own top row is fully contiguous (no holes in the top edge) while the previous bottom is fully filled with the outer number in the relevant columns, shift the new object up by 1 row (shift_r = -1) to simulate embedding or tight stacking.
 * Gap filling: When stacking without upward shift (shift_r=0) and touching, fill any horizontal gaps between the previous right edge and new object's left with the outer number to connect them seamlessly.
 * Bounds checking: Placements clip to grid size; no overwriting if out of bounds, but this can lead to partial objects if miscalculated.
 * Order of placement: Process 8-groups first, then 2-groups, on a fresh background-filled grid.
 * Easy to miss: Original position influences base column for 2's (left or right side based on min_c <9), suggesting the puzzle simulates a two-sided assembly (e.g., left for one "page", right for another).
 * No rotation or scaling: Objects retain exact relative positions and shapes.
 * Background propagation: Output starts fully as background; only placed pixels are overwritten.
 * Potential for multiple stacks per group if widths cause overflow beyond column 21.

    # Returns list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), 'min_r', 'max_r', 'min_c', 'max_c'.
    # Helpful for identifying all potential inners and outers without assuming structure.
```

```python
def touches_bg(positions: List[tuple], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    # Checks if any position in the blob (or its 4-neighbors) touches background or grid edge (edge counts as bg touch).
    # Essential for distinguishing enclosed inners from outer-touching or bg-adjacent blobs.

def blobs_adjacent(pos1: List[tuple], pos2: List[tuple]) -> bool:
    # Checks if two blobs share an edge (4-neighbor adjacency between any positions).
    # Used to confirm inner is adjacent to its outer.

def find_inners(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, atomic_blobs: List[Dict]) -> DefaultDict[int, List[int]]:
    # For each non-bg, non-outer blob, checks if it's fully enclosed: touches exactly one outer (2 or 8) via adjacency, no other numbers, no bg touch.
    # Returns dict mapping outer blob index to list of inner blob indices.
    # Key subtlety: Ignores self-num in adjacency check; only considers 2/8 as valid outers.

def build_objects(atomic_blobs: List[Dict], inners_for_outer: DefaultDict[int, List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Builds object dicts for valid outers (2/8 not used as inners), including their inners list, positions, bounds, and original min_c (for placement basing).
    # Filters out inners-as-outer cases to prevent double-use.

def place_obj(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], obj: Dict, shift_r: int, shift_c: int):
    # Places an object (outer + all inners) at shifted position, overwriting output grid cells within bounds.

def place_group(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], group: List[Dict], outer_num: int):
    # Core placement: Sorts group by original position; iterates to place in stacks.
    # Base col: 0 for 8; for 2, 12 if original_min_c <9 else 17.
    # Detects touch (min_r == prev_max_r +1) or overlap (min_r <= prev_max_r); else new stack.
    # If overflow in current stack, force new stack.
    # Up-shift (-1 row) only if touch, top row fully solid in object, and prev bottom fully outer_num in stack's col range.
    # Post-place fill: If no shift but touch, fill horizontal gap with outer_num at prev_max_r.
    # Updates stack tracking (current_max_r, current_right, current_stack_min_col).
    # Handles multiple objects per group, potential multi-stack.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all three training examples, correctly extracting blobs, identifying inners (e.g., 4 inside 2/8, 1/7 inside 8, 3/6 inside 2), building objects, and placing groups with stacking/shifting/filling, resulting in correct rearrangements.
 * Worked well for simple single-object or basic stacking cases in training, preserving shapes, enclosures, and relative positions while simulating assembly on left (8's) and right (2's) sides.
 * What didn't work: In complex test cases with multiple stacks or wide objects, the gap-filling might overfill (e.g., extending outer_num beyond intended connections), and the up-shift condition could fail if "fully covered" check misses irregular top edges (e.g., if object's top has gaps due to inner protrusion).
 * The base column logic for 2's (12 vs 17 based on original min_c <9) worked for training but might misplace if test has objects originally spanning the threshold ambiguously.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct: accurately finds all blobs without merging different numbers.
 * touches_bg is helpful and precise: correctly identifies enclosed inners by checking positions and neighbors.
 * find_inners is key but subtle: requires exactly one adjacent outer (2/8) and no bg touch; skips if multiple adjacents, preventing wrong enclosures.
 * build_objects correctly avoids using inners as outers, but could miss if an outer has no inners (still valid object).
 * place_group's stacking logic worked for training touches/overlaps but might not handle non-rectangular "full coverage" perfectly (e.g., if prev bottom has holes from prior inners).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the fill logic in place_group could be refined to check for actual gap presence rather than always filling between edges.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates good understanding of blob extraction and object hierarchy, but placement subtleties (shift conditions, fills) may need tuning for irregular shapes in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places objects in a structured way: top-left has an 8-outer with 4-inner (rows 3-7, cols 0-4, shifted/clipped); adjacent 2-group with 4/3-inners stacked around cols 12-17 (rows 0-5); mid-bottom has another 8 with 1/7-inners (rows 8-12, cols 5-15); lower-right has 2-group with 6/3-inners (rows 13-20, cols 17-21), with some fills like extended 2's in row 2 cols 12-21.
 * It makes sense overall: Groups 8's on left/mid, 2's on right, with stacking (e.g., the lower 2's touch and connect without shift, filling gaps with 2's); enclosures preserved (4 inside 2/8, etc.); background 9 elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: In the top 2-group (rows 0-5, cols 12-17+), the 4-inner in row 1 cols 13-15 overlaps the outer 2's but protrudes oddly without full enclosure in output (e.g., row 0 has 2's but no inner below, suggesting missed up-shift or fill); similarly, lower 8-group (rows 16-20, cols 0-4) has 3-inner but row 17 col 1-3 is 3's adjacent to bg 9 without outer cover, implying failed enclosure preservation or clipping error.
 * The right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show good stacking (6-inner enclosed, 3's stacked below with touch-fill), but the base col 17 placement causes slight overflow (e.g., row 15 col 21 is 2, but grid is 22 cols indexed 0-21, so okay, but looks tight).
 * Differences from expected: Expected tighter vertical integration (more up-shifts for embedded looks) and no bg exposure for inners; observed has some loose connections (e.g., row 4 col 17-21 has 2's and 3's but gaps to bg), possibly due to incomplete fill or shift misfire on irregular shapes; also, multiple 3-inners suggest test has complex objects, but output merges stacks suboptimally, leaving horizontal 9's in row 20 cols 12-16 unused.
 * The output preserves counts (e.g., two 8-objects, multiple 2's with varied inners), but positioning feels shifted right for some 2's compared to base logic, hinting at overflow forcing extra stacks without reset.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:53:55] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where "objects" composed of outer blobs (numbers 2 or 8) enclosing inner non-background numbers are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into a new output grid. The rearrangement stacks these objects horizontally by type (8s first, then 2s), with rules for shifting up if they touch solidly, merging gaps, and preserving inners, while treating the background (e.g., 1 or 9) as empty space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background value is extracted from the top-left cell and used to identify non-background elements; it varies (1 in training, 9 in test), so must be dynamic.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number, excluding background; each blob tracks positions, number, and bounding box (min/max row/col) for placement and adjacency checks.
 * Only outer blobs of 2 or 8 can form "objects"; inners are non-2/8 blobs fully enclosed by exactly one such outer (no touching background or edges, adjacent only to one outer num).
 * Objects exclude inners that are themselves used as outers to avoid nesting beyond one level.
 * Placement: Initialize output with background; place 8-objects first, then 2-objects. Stack horizontally: sort by row then col; if objects overlap rows or touch (next row), place adjacent/right of previous; if gap, start new stack at base column (0 for 8s, 12 or 17 for 2s based on original position <9 or not).
 * Subtle shifting: If touching (min_r == prev max_r +1) and not new stack, check if object's top row is solid outer_num in input AND previous stack's bottom row is solid outer_num in output; if both, shift up by -1 row (overlap vertically).
 * Gap filling: If shifted horizontally without up-shift on touch, fill the bottom row gap between stacks with outer_num.
 * Adjacency is 4-directional (up/down/left/right); touching background/edge disqualifies inners; self-num ignored in adj checks.
 * Bounds checking during placement to avoid out-of-grid writes.
 * Sorting groups by (min_r, min_c) before placement to process top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
 * Subtleties: "Solid top" checks input grid's top bounding row for continuous outer_num within bounds (but clips to grid cols); "solid bottom" checks output's previous max_r row within current stack's col range. Base cols for 2s depend on original position to separate left/right groups. No rotation or resizing; preserve exact shapes/inners.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (exact match to expected outputs, correctly extracting/placing objects with inners and stacking).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output places the inner 2-blob (rows 2-4, cols 1-3) inside the top 8-object as 1's (background) instead of preserving as 2's, e.g., generated row 2: [8,1,1,1,8,...] vs. expected [8,2,2,2,8,...]; same for rows 3-4. Bottom 8-object with inner 3's is correct. This suggests a bug in inner placement or object building for certain enclosed 2's (possibly misclassifying the inner 2 as not enclosed or not associating it properly, unknown exact cause but it fails to copy inner num during place_obj).
 * The lower sections (e.g., 6-in-8, 5-in-2, 4-in-2, 3-in-8) are placed correctly with stacking and no up-shifts.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works (correctly finds all blobs/positions/bounds).
 * find_inners works partially (detects some inners like 3's and 6's but misses or mishandles the top inner 2).
 * build_objects is likely the issue (may exclude or not associate the inner 2 correctly, perhaps due to used_as_inner logic or outer detection).
 * place_group handles stacking/touching well for non-problematic objects but inherits inner placement errors from build.
 * touches_bg and get_adj_nums are helpful and seem correct (enclosure checks pass for most cases).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj (not fully shown) may need bounds-checked inner writes verified.
 * Base column logic (12/17 for 2s) works for separating left/right groups in training 3.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules; while it extracts and places most objects (e.g., 8-with-4 inner at top-left, 8-with-1-and-7 at mid-left, 2-with-3/6 at bottom-right), there are anomalies: the top 2-object with 4-inner is split oddly (row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 followed by extra 2's that seem like a misplaced fragment; row 1 has 9's in place of expected stacking). Inners like 3-in-2 at bottom are preserved but positioning overlaps strangely (e.g., row 17 has 2,3,3,3,2 over previous 2's without clear stacking). Background 9 is handled, but no up-shifts or gap fills appear applied (e.g., no vertical merging for touching objects like the 8-with-4 and below 8's). It mismatches expected behavior by not fully stacking horizontally (e.g., 2-objects seem pushed right without base col separation, leading to col 12+ overlaps). Overall, it partially follows rules but likely fails on inner association or shift conditions similar to training 3 error.

[2025-09-30 19:53:55] Prompt:
You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**

```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing shapes or "objects" (like containers or blobs formed by connected cells of the same number), extracting atomic connected components (blobs), identifying composite objects (e.g., an outer shell of 2 or 8 containing an inner filling like 1,3,4,5,6,9), and then reassembling these objects in a new output grid by stacking them in columns based on their outer type (8 on the left, 2 on the right), simulating gravity-like placement where objects stack vertically, connect if tops and bottoms align solidly, and start new stacks if needed, while preserving inner/outer distinctions and handling open tops specially.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically 0 but can vary (e.g., 1 in train 3, 4 or 9 in others); always detect it from g[0][0] and ignore it for blob extraction.
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of the same non-bg number; track min/max row/col for bounding boxes and positions for adjacency checks.
 * Objects are either simple (outer 2 or 8 with no inner) or composite (inner blob like 5 adjacent to outer 2/8); only consider inners adjacent to exactly one outer type (prioritize max adjacency count for 2/8), and mark "is_open_top" if the inner's top row is fully bg-exposed (for special placement rules like filling with outer on open tops).
 * Stacking rules: Sort objects by min_r then min_c; place in groups by outer_num (8 first at col 0, then 2 at cols 12 or 17 based on original position <9 or not); for each object, check if it touches/overlaps previous stack (is_touch if min_r == current_max_r +1, is_overlap if min_r <= current_max_r); if connectable (solid top on new obj + solid bottom on previous stack), shift up by -1 row; otherwise, place at row 0 or start new stack; fill gaps horizontally with outer_num if touching without shifting; track current_max_r, current_right, and stack_min_col to prevent overflow (grid cols=22).
 * Subtle placement: In place_obj, for open-top inners, fill top inner row with outer_num if shifted; ensure out grid starts as all bg; only place 2/8 outers, ignore others unless inner.
 * Easy to miss: Adjacency for building objects requires checking all neighbor cells of inner positions for outer nums (2/8), counting touches; multiple inners can merge to one outer if touching same outer blob; solid_top check must verify entire top row of obj is outer_num (or open-top condition); bottom solid check scans previous row's relevant cols for outer_num; new stacks for 2 use different base cols (12 if original_min_c <9, else 17) to separate left/right groups; prevent out-of-bounds placement; preserve exact shapes without rotation or scaling.
 * Physics-like stacking: Objects "fall" to row 0 initially but shift up only if fully supportable; if width causes overflow, force new stack; after placement, update current_max_r/max_c globally per group.
 * Grid size: Always 22x22? Inputs are lists of 22 lists with 22 ints; output same size, all bg init.
 * Other: No diagonals for connectivity; used set prevents reprocessing blobs; sort objects before placing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds some composite objects (e.g., 5 inside 8, 4 inside 8), grouping by outer_num (8 and 2) and attempting stacking with shifts/fills.
 * What worked: Basic connected component detection via extract_atomic_blobs; adjacency checks for inners/outers; initialization of out as bg; sorting objects for placement order; base column logic for 2's (12/17 split); some gap filling and open-top handling.
 * What didn't work: Stacking logic buggy—e.g., in train 1, 3's placed separately instead of stacking under previous 8's (expected connects 3's to row 6 under 8's, but generated keeps them detached at row 8); open_top detection assumes bg=0 (fails if bg=1/4/9); solid_top/is_solid_top often false-negatives, preventing shifts (e.g., train 1 row 6 expected has 3's shifted up but generated doesn't); bottom check all_prev_bottom scans wrong range or misses partial supports; in train 2, 3's and 6's misaligned (generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected shifts them right/under; row 19 expected has 6's shifted up into 8's but generated doesn't); train 3 completely wrong layout (generated keeps original-ish positions with 1's as bg? but expected rotates/stacks 2's/3's/6's vertically on right, fills left with 1's); place_obj overwrites inners incorrectly on shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom 4's have wrong inner placement); new_stack detection too aggressive, causing unnecessary side-by-side instead of vertical stacking; candidates in build_objects only check 2/8 but may miss if inner touches other nums first; used set misses multi-blob merges.
 * Train 1: Generated has detached 3's at rows 8-10 (expected stacked at row 6 under 8's); bottom 4's stacked wrong (generated row 17 has 4's but expected row 17 has 3's? Wait, no—expected row 17: 2,4,4,4,2 but generated has 2,0,0,0,2—unknown why zeros, perhaps no inner detected); 9's misplaced in right stack.
 * Train 2: Generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected empty/ shifted; row 19 expected 4,4,4,... with 6's up but generated has 2,2,2,... no shift; row 6 generated full 4's bottom but expected partial.
 * Train 3: Generated mostly preserves input layout with 1's as fill/bg but expected major rearrangement (e.g., top 2's become right stack, 6's under 8's on left, 3's/4's/5's stacked vertically); unknown why no stacking occurs—perhaps bg=1 confuses extraction.
 * Function `is_solid_top` is helpful but buggy (hardcodes outer_num check, misses open_top for non-row0 mins); `place_group` core but flawed in shift_r logic (only -1 or 0, no full gravity drop; all_prev_bottom assumes full outer_num span but partial supports possible); `place_obj` useful for pos shifting but inner placement conditional is_open_top + r==inner_min_r fails if shifted.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 9 as a filler/bg (spreading everywhere) but places 8/2 structures partially, with misalignments like 4's not stacking under 8's properly (rows 3-5: 8's over 9's, expected likely shifts 4's up); right side 3's at rows 17-20 detached/spread into 9's (expected vertical stack like train 1/2); top rows have 9's overwriting potential outers; 1's tiny blob at rows 7-10 misplaced/not extracted as inner; overall no clear left-8/right-2 columns, gaps filled wrong (e.g., row 15: 2,9,9,9,2 instead of solid 2's); looks like bg detection works (9?) but stacking fails entirely, similar to train 3—probably open_top or solid checks broken for this bg/input shapes; does not match expected physics-stacking (e.g., 3's should stack under previous, not float).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 5/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where "objects" composed of outer blobs (numbers 2 or 8) enclosing inner non-background numbers are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into a new output grid. The rearrangement stacks these objects horizontally by type (8s first, then 2s), with rules for shifting up if they touch solidly, merging gaps, and preserving inners, while treating the background (e.g., 1 or 9) as empty space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background value is extracted from the top-left cell and used to identify non-background elements; it varies (1 in training, 9 in test), so must be dynamic.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number, excluding background; each blob tracks positions, number, and bounding box (min/max row/col) for placement and adjacency checks.
 * Only outer blobs of 2 or 8 can form "objects"; inners are non-2/8 blobs fully enclosed by exactly one such outer (no touching background or edges, adjacent only to one outer num).
 * Objects exclude inners that are themselves used as outers to avoid nesting beyond one level.
 * Placement: Initialize output with background; place 8-objects first, then 2-objects. Stack horizontally: sort by row then col; if objects overlap rows or touch (next row), place adjacent/right of previous; if gap, start new stack at base column (0 for 8s, 12 or 17 for 2s based on original position <9 or not).
 * Subtle shifting: If touching (min_r == prev max_r +1) and not new stack, check if object's top row is solid outer_num in input AND previous stack's bottom row is solid outer_num in output; if both, shift up by -1 row (overlap vertically).
 * Gap filling: If shifted horizontally without up-shift on touch, fill the bottom row gap between stacks with outer_num.
 * Adjacency is 4-directional (up/down/left/right); touching background/edge disqualifies inners; self-num ignored in adj checks.
 * Bounds checking during placement to avoid out-of-grid writes.
 * Sorting groups by (min_r, min_c) before placement to process top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
 * Subtleties: "Solid top" checks input grid's top bounding row for continuous outer_num within bounds (but clips to grid cols); "solid bottom" checks output's previous max_r row within current stack's col range. Base cols for 2s depend on original position to separate left/right groups. No rotation or resizing; preserve exact shapes/inners.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (exact match to expected outputs, correctly extracting/placing objects with inners and stacking).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output places the inner 2-blob (rows 2-4, cols 1-3) inside the top 8-object as 1's (background) instead of preserving as 2's, e.g., generated row 2: [8,1,1,1,8,...] vs. expected [8,2,2,2,8,...]; same for rows 3-4. Bottom 8-object with inner 3's is correct. This suggests a bug in inner placement or object building for certain enclosed 2's (possibly misclassifying the inner 2 as not enclosed or not associating it properly, unknown exact cause but it fails to copy inner num during place_obj).
 * The lower sections (e.g., 6-in-8, 5-in-2, 4-in-2, 3-in-8) are placed correctly with stacking and no up-shifts.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works (correctly finds all blobs/positions/bounds).
 * find_inners works partially (detects some inners like 3's and 6's but misses or mishandles the top inner 2).
 * build_objects is likely the issue (may exclude or not associate the inner 2 correctly, perhaps due to used_as_inner logic or outer detection).
 * place_group handles stacking/touching well for non-problematic objects but inherits inner placement errors from build.
 * touches_bg and get_adj_nums are helpful and seem correct (enclosure checks pass for most cases).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj (not fully shown) may need bounds-checked inner writes verified.
 * Base column logic (12/17 for 2s) works for separating left/right groups in training 3.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules; while it extracts and places most objects (e.g., 8-with-4 inner at top-left, 8-with-1-and-7 at mid-left, 2-with-3/6 at bottom-right), there are anomalies: the top 2-object with 4-inner is split oddly (row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 followed by extra 2's that seem like a misplaced fragment; row 1 has 9's in place of expected stacking). Inners like 3-in-2 at bottom are preserved but positioning overlaps strangely (e.g., row 17 has 2,3,3,3,2 over previous 2's without clear stacking). Background 9 is handled, but no up-shifts or gap fills appear applied (e.g., no vertical merging for touching objects like the 8-with-4 and below 8's). It mismatches expected behavior by not fully stacking horizontally (e.g., 2-objects seem pushed right without base col separation, leading to col 12+ overlaps). Overall, it partially follows rules but likely fails on inner association or shift conditions similar to training 3 error.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of nested "objects" (connected blobs of numbers, specifically outers made of 2 or 8 containing inner blobs) from an input grid, then rearranging and stacking these objects into a standardized 22x22 output grid with background fill (1 or 9), following rules for positioning, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate a compact, layered composition without overlaps or excessive spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are defined as atomic connected components (blobs) of the same number, excluding background (bg, e.g., 1 or 9); inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob of type 2 or 8, not touching bg or other numbers.
 * Stacking occurs separately for 8-objects (first) and 2-objects (second), sorted by row then column; new stacks start at specific columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position), with vertical shifts (-1 row up) only if the current object's top fully matches the previous stack's bottom in outer material and no overlap.
 * Gap-filling: When stacking adjacently (touching but not overlapping), fill horizontal gaps at the connection row with outer material; prevent horizontal overflows by starting new stacks if width exceeds remaining space (max col 21).
 * Subtleties: Blobs must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right); inners skip if adjacent to multiple outers or non-2/8; placement ignores out-of-bounds but doesn't clip; original min_c influences base column for 2-objects (<9 -> col 12, else 17); all-top-outer and all-prev-bottom checks are crucial for upward shifts but only apply to touching non-new-stacks.
 * Easy-to-miss: Background varies (1 in train, 9 in test); self_num exclusion in adjacency checks; no diagonal connections; objects without valid inners or touching bg are ignored; sorting and current_stack_min_col tracking prevent misalignment in multi-object stacks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve inner/outer numbers exactly; output is always 22x22; handle cases where objects span multiple rows/cols with min/max bounding boxes for placement.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs), successfully extracting nested objects and stacking with shifts/fills.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., row 2 [8,1,1,1,8,...] instead of expected [8,2,2,2,8,...] (1's where 2's should be, suggesting a 2-object was not shifted up or gap not filled properly); row 3/4 similar mismatches with 1's persisting; row 14 has 1's where expected has nothing specified but pattern implies outer extension; overall, stacking logic misapplies upward shifts or adjacency checks for 2-objects, leading to unfilled gaps treated as bg (1).
 * Differences in train 3 are specific to 2-object placements (e.g., a vertical 2-blob in cols 2-4 rows 2-4 is replaced by 1's in generated, indicating failure to detect/place an inner or outer correctly); unknown why 1's appear instead of 2's—possibly flawed all_top_outer check using input g instead of tracking placed state, or incorrect blob adjacency.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and place_group are essential and mostly correct (worked for train 1/2), but place_group's shift_r condition (all_top_outer on input g) is broken for multi-object interactions as it doesn't reflect the evolving output state.
 * touches_bg and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for isolation checks.
 * build_objects is useful for structuring but skips non-2/8, which is correct.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj could be enhanced to avoid overwriting (but doesn't in this case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=9) mostly follows the stacking pattern from train 3 expected, placing 8-objects left/center and 2-objects right, with some nesting (e.g., 4's inside 8's at rows 3-6 cols 0-4; 3's inside 2's at rows 17-20 cols 12-16), and gap-fills visible (e.g., row 2 cols 17-21 as 2's).
 * It does not look fully correct: Several potential misplacements, e.g., row 3 has [8,8,8,8,8,9,...,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] but includes extra 2's in cols 17-21 that might be unfilled gaps or incorrect extension; row 8 has 8's extending into col 10-14 unexpectedly, possibly from a merged stack without proper new_stack trigger; row 16 has 2's in cols 12-16 with 3's, but row 17 shifts to [8,3,3,3,8,...] which aligns but may miss an upward shift similar to train 3 error (3's appear where bg=9 should if not filled).
 * Compared to train 3 expected patterns, test output has analogous issues: Persistent bg (9) where outers should extend (e.g., row 5 col 12-16 as 9's instead of potential 2's); inner 1's in rows 9-11 cols 6-8 inside 8's look correct, but 7's in cols 11-13 may be misplaced if not fully enclosed; overall, stacking seems to start new stacks too early (e.g., 2-objects at col 12 but with overflows), and no upward shifts observed, leading to vertical spacing that doesn't compact touching objects—does not match the tight nesting in train expected (e.g., no -1 row shifts applied).
 * To handle test: Account for bg=9; ensure all_top_outer checks use placed output state, not input g; verify width calculations prevent col>21 overflows by forcing new stacks earlier; test output misses compacting for touching 8/2 groups, resulting in looser layout than expected tight composition.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to parse a grid of numbered cells (representing shapes or blobs) into composite "objects" consisting of outer enclosures (specifically numbers 2 or 8) and their fully enclosed inner blobs, then reassemble these objects in a new output grid by grouping and stacking them horizontally and vertically in designated column ranges, connecting adjacent objects where their edges align to form continuous structures while preserving inner details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the value at grid[0][0] (9 in examples); all non-background connected components of the same number form "atomic blobs" via flood-fill, tracking positions, bounds (min/max row/col), but excluding background-touching blobs for inner detection.
 * Inner blobs must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob (only 2 or 8 qualify as outers), not touch the background, and be adjacent only to that single outer number; multiple adjacents or background contact disqualifies them as inners.
 * Objects are built only from unused outer blobs (2 or 8) that aren't themselves inners; inners are associated per outer via index lists.
 * Placement separates groups by outer number: 8-objects stack starting from column 0 (left side); 2-objects stack starting from column 12 (if original min_c < 9) or 17 (otherwise, suggesting left/middle vs. right-side originals in input).
 * Stacking logic sorts objects by min_r then min_c; attempts vertical connection (shift_r = -1) only if the new object's top row is all outer_num and the previous stack's bottom is all outer_num in overlapping columns; otherwise places at shift_r=0; fills horizontal gaps in the connection row with outer_num if touching without shift.
 * New stacks start if not touching/overlapping previous or if width exceeds remaining columns; updates current max_r, rightmost col, and stack min_col for overlap checks.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency for enclosure checks uses 4-directional (up/down/left/right); blob extraction uses stack-based DFS for efficiency; placement bounds-checks to avoid out-of-grid writes; no rotation or scaling—positions are relative and shifted directly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Inners can be any non-bg/non-outer number (e.g., 1,3,4,6,7); objects preserve exact relative positions including inners; filling gaps only happens on touch without vertical shift; original_min_c determines 2-object column base, implying input layout influences output positioning.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle multiple inners per outer; avoid using background or non-qualifying blobs as objects; ensure no overlap in placement beyond intended connections; track used inners to prevent double-use; sort groups for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right stacking.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, successfully extracting blobs, identifying inners for outers 2/8, building objects, and placing them with stacking logic that connects where tops/bottoms are uniform outer_num.
 * Worked well for simple enclosures and stacking without overlaps; base column logic (0 for 8, 12/17 for 2 based on original position) preserved input-side distinctions.
 * Potential issue in vertical shift check: the all_top_outer check references original g (input grid), but should verify the object's own top row in its positions (not g[obj_min_r], as g may have inners or gaps); this could cause incorrect -1 shifts if input top isn't pure outer.
 * Gap filling only on touch without shift, but may overfill if columns don't align perfectly; no handling for diagonal touches or 8-connectivity.
 * Innermost detection skips bg-touching correctly, but assumes single outer adjacency—may miss complex enclosures with multiple layers.
 * build_objects skips used inners properly, avoiding recursion.
 * Overall, blob extraction and adjacency functions are solid and essential; place_group is core but has subtle bugs in connection checks referencing wrong grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 8-object stacks on the left (columns 0-5, with inners like 4,3,1,7), a central 2-object stack around columns 12-17 (with inners 4,3,6), and a right-side 2-stack around columns 17-21 (with inners 3,6); background 9 fills the rest, with some extensions like row 3-4 2's protruding right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Several placements show incomplete connections, e.g., row 4 has 8,4,4,4,8 but adjacent rows have gaps or misalignments (row 5 has 8,4,4,4,8 but then jumps to 9's); the central 2-stack in rows 1-3 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 0 above it has 2,2,2,2,2 without inner, suggesting failed vertical shift or gap fill—expected seamless stacking if tops/bottoms match.
 * Right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show stacking with inners 6 and 3, but row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 overlapping a previous 2,6,6,6,2 without full connection (gaps in row 17-18), differing from expected by not filling horizontal gaps properly or shifting up.
 * Bottom rows (20-21) have isolated 8's and 9's, but upper rows like 7-8 show wide 8's without inners, possibly correct but the overall structure has jagged edges where smooth connections were expected; unknown why some 2's extend into column 21 in row 3 without support.
 * No obvious missing objects (all numbers 1-8 appear placed), but placements seem shifted incorrectly in vertical stacks, leading to overlaps or gaps not filled with outer_num.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of numbers representing colored shapes or blobs on a background (9), extracting atomic connected components, identifying composite "objects" consisting of outer blobs (specifically numbers 2 or 8) that fully enclose inner blobs without the inners touching the background, and then rearranging these objects into a new output grid by grouping similar outers, sorting them spatially, and stacking them horizontally in designated columns with rules for vertical alignment, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate physical stacking or assembly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected regions of the same number (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding the background (9).
 * Only outers with number 2 or 8 are considered for objects; inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one such outer, not touch the background, and be adjacent to it.
 * Objects may have multiple inners, but inners cannot themselves be outers (no nesting beyond one level).
 * In placement, groups of objects with the same outer number are sorted by their original min_r then min_c.
 * Stacking logic: Objects are placed starting in base columns (0 for 8; 12 if original min_c <9 else 17 for 2), forming vertical stacks if they touch or overlap the previous object's bottom; new stacks start if no connection.
 * Subtle shifting: If an object touches the previous stack's bottom row and its own top row is fully contiguous (no holes in the top edge) while the previous bottom is fully filled with the outer number in the relevant columns, shift the new object up by 1 row (shift_r = -1) to simulate embedding or tight stacking.
 * Gap filling: When stacking without upward shift (shift_r=0) and touching, fill any horizontal gaps between the previous right edge and new object's left with the outer number to connect them seamlessly.
 * Bounds checking: Placements clip to grid size; no overwriting if out of bounds, but this can lead to partial objects if miscalculated.
 * Order of placement: Process 8-groups first, then 2-groups, on a fresh background-filled grid.
 * Easy to miss: Original position influences base column for 2's (left or right side based on min_c <9), suggesting the puzzle simulates a two-sided assembly (e.g., left for one "page", right for another).
 * No rotation or scaling: Objects retain exact relative positions and shapes.
 * Background propagation: Output starts fully as background; only placed pixels are overwritten.
 * Potential for multiple stacks per group if widths cause overflow beyond column 21.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all three training examples, correctly extracting blobs, identifying inners (e.g., 4 inside 2/8, 1/7 inside 8, 3/6 inside 2), building objects, and placing groups with stacking/shifting/filling, resulting in correct rearrangements.
 * Worked well for simple single-object or basic stacking cases in training, preserving shapes, enclosures, and relative positions while simulating assembly on left (8's) and right (2's) sides.
 * What didn't work: In complex test cases with multiple stacks or wide objects, the gap-filling might overfill (e.g., extending outer_num beyond intended connections), and the up-shift condition could fail if "fully covered" check misses irregular top edges (e.g., if object's top has gaps due to inner protrusion).
 * The base column logic for 2's (12 vs 17 based on original min_c <9) worked for training but might misplace if test has objects originally spanning the threshold ambiguously.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct: accurately finds all blobs without merging different numbers.
 * touches_bg is helpful and precise: correctly identifies enclosed inners by checking positions and neighbors.
 * find_inners is key but subtle: requires exactly one adjacent outer (2/8) and no bg touch; skips if multiple adjacents, preventing wrong enclosures.
 * build_objects correctly avoids using inners as outers, but could miss if an outer has no inners (still valid object).
 * place_group's stacking logic worked for training touches/overlaps but might not handle non-rectangular "full coverage" perfectly (e.g., if prev bottom has holes from prior inners).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the fill logic in place_group could be refined to check for actual gap presence rather than always filling between edges.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates good understanding of blob extraction and object hierarchy, but placement subtleties (shift conditions, fills) may need tuning for irregular shapes in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places objects in a structured way: top-left has an 8-outer with 4-inner (rows 3-7, cols 0-4, shifted/clipped); adjacent 2-group with 4/3-inners stacked around cols 12-17 (rows 0-5); mid-bottom has another 8 with 1/7-inners (rows 8-12, cols 5-15); lower-right has 2-group with 6/3-inners (rows 13-20, cols 17-21), with some fills like extended 2's in row 2 cols 12-21.
 * It makes sense overall: Groups 8's on left/mid, 2's on right, with stacking (e.g., the lower 2's touch and connect without shift, filling gaps with 2's); enclosures preserved (4 inside 2/8, etc.); background 9 elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: In the top 2-group (rows 0-5, cols 12-17+), the 4-inner in row 1 cols 13-15 overlaps the outer 2's but protrudes oddly without full enclosure in output (e.g., row 0 has 2's but no inner below, suggesting missed up-shift or fill); similarly, lower 8-group (rows 16-20, cols 0-4) has 3-inner but row 17 col 1-3 is 3's adjacent to bg 9 without outer cover, implying failed enclosure preservation or clipping error.
 * The right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show good stacking (6-inner enclosed, 3's stacked below with touch-fill), but the base col 17 placement causes slight overflow (e.g., row 15 col 21 is 2, but grid is 22 cols indexed 0-21, so okay, but looks tight).
 * Differences from expected: Expected tighter vertical integration (more up-shifts for embedded looks) and no bg exposure for inners; observed has some loose connections (e.g., row 4 col 17-21 has 2's and 3's but gaps to bg), possibly due to incomplete fill or shift misfire on irregular shapes; also, multiple 3-inners suggest test has complex objects, but output merges stacks suboptimally, leaving horizontal 9's in row 20 cols 12-16 unused.
 * The output preserves counts (e.g., two 8-objects, multiple 2's with varied inners), but positioning feels shifted right for some 2's compared to base logic, hinting at overflow forcing extra stacks without reset.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 19:59:47] Response:
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where numbered cells represent colored blobs or shapes on a background, and the goal is to detect, extract, and rearrange composite "objects" (outers with possible inners) from an input grid into a standardized 22x22 output grid following specific stacking and placement rules, likely to form a coherent visual pattern or solve a reassembly challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from the top-left cell; all non-bg connected components (blobs) of the same number are treated as atomic units via flood-fill (4-directional connectivity).
 * Objects are composites: only outers with numbers 2 or 8 that fully enclose exactly one type of inner blob (not touching bg, adjacent only to that outer), and inners must be fully surrounded without other adjacencies.
 * Placement rules are complex: output is 22x22 initialized to bg; objects are grouped by outer_num (2 or 8); within groups, sort by row/col and place sequentially, preferring to stack vertically if touching/overlapping previous, or start new "stack" in fixed columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position); check for "top_open" (non-solid top edge in input) and add lids if stacking; handle shifts to avoid overlap and fit within bounds; update current max_r and right edge for stacking decisions.
 * Subtleties: Blobs touching bg are not inners; adjacency checks must ignore self and bg; no diagonal connectivity; for 2's, column choice depends on original min_c (<9 -> col 12, else 17); lids only added if top_open and not new stack; ensure no out-of-bounds writes; potential for multiple inners per outer, but only if all share the same outer.
 * Easy to miss: Global 'g' reference in nested functions causes scope errors; input grid size varies (not always 22x22), but output is fixed; blob bounding boxes for width calc; sorting groups by min_r then min_c for order; no rotation or flipping—preserve orientation; unused inners or outers are ignored; possible empty groups.

**Unhelpful or broken functions (avoid in future):**
```python
def place_obj(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], obj: Dict, shift_r: int, shift_c: int):
    # Places outer and its inners into output grid with shifts; bounds-checked writes.
    # Helpful in concept, but relies on external 'g' in caller—could be improved by passing input grid if needed for validation.

def place_group(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], group: List[Dict], outer_num: int):
    # Handles sequential placement/stacking logic for a group; includes top_open/lid logic and column basing.
    # Broken: References undefined global 'g' in top_open check (line: if 0 <= c < len(g) and g[top_r][c] != outer_num); uses input g for solidity check but g not passed/defined in scope—causes execution error. Also, lid placement assumes shift_r=0 always (hardcoded). Sorting and stacking logic seems correct but untested due to error. Not fully helpful until fixed; core placement but fragile.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates good understanding of blob extraction and object composition but fails entirely on execution due to scope error with 'g' in place_group.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and build_objects are solid and essential for decomposing the input into reusable objects—worked in isolation but untested.
 * place_group is the main failure point: ambitious stacking/lid logic captures puzzle subtleties (e.g., conditional columns, top_open detection), but the undefined 'g' (intended for input grid solidity check) crashes everything; this is a simple fix (pass g as param) but indicates incomplete scoping.
 * No successful runs, so no partial outputs to analyze; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) produced identical errors, meaning no grid generation at all—expected rearranged 22x22 with placed objects, but got none.
 * groups defaultdict and sorting by (min_r, min_c) seem correct for ordering; base_func for columns handles 8 vs 2 differentiation well.
 * No mismatches in blob shapes or omissions noted (since no output), but logic filters out invalid inners correctly in theory.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so no grid is generated—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a valid 22x22 output grid with rearranged objects placed per rules.
 * Expected: A populated 22x22 grid with bg-filled, objects from input (outers 2/8 with inners) stacked in columns (e.g., 8's at col 0, 2's at 12/17), possibly with lids on open tops, preserving shapes/orientation, and empty space as bg; the error produces nothing, so it misses all placement, stacking, and enclosure handling.
 * Does not make sense: Zero progress on visual reassembly; the error is superficial (scope), but reveals the placement logic isn't robust (e.g., why check input g for top_open during output placement? Should compute top_open from blob data alone to avoid needing g).
 * To handle test: Fix 'g' scope by passing input grid to place_group or refactor top_open to use blob positions/bounding box instead of raw g access; verify against test input (unknown here, but assume it has multiple 2/8 objects with inners needing stacking without overflow).

You are trying to build a program to solve this puzzle. The puzzle is presented as a set of inputs and outputs. Your job is to 1) infer the rules of the puzzle and how to generate the correct output for any given input based on these pairs and 2) a program that represents these rules and can be applied to any of the train or test inputs.

Here is a summary of previous attempts:


=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving 22x22 grids (padded with 0s or background numbers like 9s in the test) filled with connected "shapes" or "blobs" formed by identical numbers (e.g., 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s), often with "frames" (e.g., 8s surrounding inner numbers like 5s or 1s), and the goal is to transform the input by extracting, standardizing, and repositioning these blobs into a canonical output layout, likely aligning them to the top-left while preserving internal structures and possibly sorting or ordering them by number type, position, or size.

 * Blobs are connected components of the same number (likely 4-connected, as diagonal connections don't seem to merge separate shapes in examples), often forming "framed" structures where an outer number (e.g., 8) surrounds an inner one (e.g., 5 or 1), and these must be preserved as units without breaking internal connections.
 * Output repositions blobs to fill from the top-left of the grid, removing interstitial empty space (0s or background), but maintains relative shapes and orientations—e.g., in train 1, the left 8-5-3 frame is vertically stacked and shifted left/up, while the 2-1 blob moves right/down relative to it, and lower blobs like 2-9 and 2-6 are aligned below.
 * Subtlety: Blobs may overlap or be adjacent in input but must be separated and reordered in output, possibly by "first appearance" scan order (row-major from top-left) or by the inner/outer number value (e.g., sorting frames by inner number: 5 before 1 before 3); in train 2, 8-9-3 and 8-1-6 frames are reordered vertically on left, with 2-5 and 2-6 on right.
 * Background varies (0s in trains 1/3, 4s/1s in trains 2/3, 9s in test), and output treats it as filler—blobs "sink" or align against it without merging; empty rows/columns in input are collapsed, but output preserves grid size with background.
 * Ordering seems consistent: Frames (e.g., 8-surrounded) are placed first on left, inners (e.g., 3s) integrated, then standalone or right-side blobs (e.g., 2-1, 2-9); in train 3, 8-2 frame moves up, 8-6 below it, 2-5 to bottom-right.
 * Easy to miss: Rotations or mirrors aren't applied (shapes keep orientation); partial fills (e.g., incomplete frames) stay as-is; multiple same-number blobs (e.g., multiple 2-frames) are placed sequentially without merging.
 * Across attempts: No rotation/flipping observed; test input has complex overlapping (e.g., 9-background with 8-1-7 frame and 2-4/6/3 blobs), requiring careful extraction to avoid background bleed (e.g., 9s shouldn't integrate into blobs).
 * Global: Output grid is always 22x22; transformations preserve blob sizes/counts but shift positions to minimize empty space from top-left.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (only one shown) simply copies the input grid unchanged, which fails all training examples because the puzzle requires transforming/repositioning blobs rather than identity output—e.g., in train 1, generated keeps scattered positions (8-5 on left rows 1-5, 2-1 on cols 9-13 rows 2-6), but expected aligns 8-5-3 vertically on left cols 0-4 rows 1-6, shifts 2-1 to right cols 17-21 rows 2-6, moves 2-9 down to rows 9-12 cols 13-17, and 2-6/4 to bottom rows 14-20 cols 0-4/12-16; differences unknown but clearly positional shifts.
 * Train 2 mismatches: Generated has 8-9-5 on left rows 2-6 cols 2-7 but expected shifts to cols 0-4 rows 2-6 with 2-5/3 on right cols 12-16; lower 8-3/6 unchanged but expected reorders 8-1-6 to rows 15-19 cols 0-4/8-12; 4-background preserved but blobs not aligned.
 * Train 3 mismatches: Generated keeps 8-2 on rows 1-5 cols 3-7, but expected moves to cols 0-4 rows 1-5; 2-3/5 scattered (rows 1-12 cols 12-16), expected aligns 2-3 to cols 17-21 rows 1-5, 2-5 to bottom rows 9-11 cols 12-16; 8-6/3/4 reordered vertically.
 * No extraction attempted, so all blob identifications fail—copying ignores connectivity and ordering.
 * Function `copy_grid` is unhelpful/broken for the puzzle (just identity; avoid in future as it doesn't transform anything).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct—it is identical to the input (just copied), showing scattered blobs like 2-4 frame on left rows 0-4 cols 1-5, 8-3-4 on right rows 3-7 cols 16-20, 8-1-7 vertical on rows 8-11 cols 2-6, and 2-6/3 lower rows 15-19 cols 3-7/15-19, all amid 9-background.
 * It is missing the expected top-left alignment and reordering: e.g., should likely stack 8-frames (1-7, 3-4) vertically on left cols 0-4 rows ~1-10, place 2-4/6/3 sequentially on right or below (cols ~10-14 or rows 11+), collapse 9-empty space, and integrate inners without background interference; current output retains input chaos, so incorrect for same reasons as trains (no extraction/placement).

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving a grid of numbers where the goal is to identify connected components ("blobs" or "objects") of the same number (excluding background), handle potential nesting or enclosure of blobs, and then reassemble these objects into a new grid by placing them in a specific order (e.g., discovery order) into available background space without overlapping, effectively "packing" or reconstructing a canonical or sorted layout.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected groups of the same number, identified via flood-fill or DFS/BFS, excluding the background number (assumed to be g[0][0], often 0 or 8 in examples).
 * Objects touching the background (via edges or out-of-bounds) should be treated as top-level and placed independently.
 * Nested or enclosed blobs (not touching background) should be merged with their enclosing outer blob if they adjoin only one other number type and the adjacent positions fully match the outer blob's structure; this merging combines positions and values into a single object.
 * Discovery order for sorting: Scan the grid row-major (top-to-left), using the first (top-left-most) cell of each blob as the key for sorting objects before placement.
 * Placement rules: Create a new grid filled with background; for each sorted object, find the top-most row and left-most column where the entire object fits without going out-of-bounds or overlapping non-background cells, then place it by shifting its relative positions.
 * Subtleties: Merging must preserve the outer blob's discovery point; non-mergeable enclosed blobs should still be placed as separate objects. The grid size is fixed (22x22 in code, but examples show 22 rows with varying effective content). Background can vary per example (e.g., 0, 8, 4, 1). Ensure no overlaps during placement, and objects must fit exactly in shape. Easy to miss: Enclosed blobs might not always merge (e.g., if adjacent to multiple types or partial overlap), and placement is greedy top-left but must check full validity before placing. All cells in an object keep their original values; no rotation or flipping. Scanning order affects discovery, so row-major is key.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
def extract_atomic_blobs(g, bg_num):
    # Flood-fill to find connected components (blobs) of same number, returning list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), and 'discovery' (first (r,c) found).
    # Useful for identifying base units; handles 4 directions (up, down, left, right).
    # Returns blobs in row-major discovery order.
```

```python
def is_touching_bg(g, blob, bg_num, directions):
    # Checks if any cell in blob is adjacent (including edges) to background or out-of-bounds.
    # Essential for distinguishing top-level vs. enclosed objects.
```

```python
def get_adjacent_outer_pos(g, blob, bg_num, outer_num, directions):
    # Collects set of adjacent positions to a specific outer_num from blob's cells.
    # Helpful for verifying if an inner blob is fully enclosed by/adjacent to a candidate outer blob.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt correctly implements blob extraction via DFS/stack, identifying connected components accurately in isolation.
 * Sorting by discovery key (first cell's (r,c)) works as a row-major ordering mechanism.
 * Placement logic attempts greedy top-left fitting, which is conceptually right but fails due to incorrect object composition (e.g., non-merged or wrongly merged blobs lead to shape mismatches).
 * Merging logic for enclosed blobs is broken: It checks adjacency to only one num and partial position overlap, but doesn't handle full enclosure or multiple possible outers correctly, leading to unmerged or incorrectly combined objects.
 * In Train 1: Generated has misplaced 3's inside 2's and scattered 1's/9's; expected shows structured vertical stacking (e.g., 5's above 3's, 2's with inner 1's/9's properly nested but placed separately). Difference: Generated packs horizontally/erratically; ignores nesting (e.g., 1's not inner to 2's as in expected).
 * In Train 2: Generated flips/misplaces upper sections (e.g., 2's with inner 3's/5's above 8's, but expected has 4's as base with 2's/3's/5's/9's layered above); 1's/6's scattered. Difference: Generated inverts vertical order and merges wrongly (e.g., 3's inside 8's instead of separate); bottom 4's are correct but upper is jumbled.
 * In Train 3: Generated has 1's as base with scattered 2's/3's/5's/6's above; expected has 1's as base but with proper layering (e.g., 2's with inner 5's/6's, 3's/4's below). Difference: Generated doesn't nest correctly (e.g., 5's not inner to 2's); placement starts from wrong discovery points, leading to horizontal spreads instead of vertical stacks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for base identification.
 * is_touching_bg and get_adjacent_outer_pos are helpful but underused—merging needs better validation (e.g., check if all inner adjacents are covered by outer).
 * No unhelpful functions noted, but the overall object-building loop is flawed (falls back to single blobs too often, missing multi-level nesting).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output does not look correct; it appears to pack objects horizontally and merge incompletely (e.g., 2's with partial 4's/1's/3's/9's, 8's scattered with inner 7's/9's, large bottom 9's block). This creates a dense, irregular layout unlike the structured, layered expected patterns in training (e.g., vertical stacks with nesting like 2's enclosing 1's/9's, 8's as frames). Likely wrong due to same merging/placement issues: Enclosed 1's/7's/9's not properly inner to 2's/8's, and discovery order ignored for vertical alignment. Without expected, it doesn't match training's "rebuild canonical" vibe—seems too chaotic, missing full enclosure handling (e.g., 9's should nest inside 2's or 8's based on adjacency).

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a 22x22 grid of numbers representing visual elements or "objects" composed of connected regions (blobs) of the same number, potentially with outer shells and inner fillings, against a background (bg). The goal is to extract these composite objects, apply rules like filling open tops for certain inners if bg=0, and rearrange them into a new output grid with specific positioning: packing groups of 8's left-to-right, placing 2's at fixed bases (12 or 17) based on their original left position, and handling other numbers similarly by packing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected components (up, down, left, right) of the same non-bg number; use flood-fill (stack-based DFS) to extract positions for each.
 * Objects are hierarchical: an "inner" blob (e.g., filling) is part of an "outer" blob if adjacent to exactly one other number type and touching it; standalone blobs are treated as their own outer.
 * If bg=0, check for "open tops" on inners (top row of inner has bg above any position) and fill those top cells with outer_num instead of inner_num to simulate closure.
 * Placement rules are number-specific and position-aware: for 8's, sort by top-left discovery key (min_r, then min_c in that row) and pack row-by-row from left, shifting right to avoid overlaps (compute max delta per row based on current_right trackers). For 2's, shift to base column 12 if original min_c <=8, else 17, without packing. Other numbers pack like 8's but skipped in this code.
 * Grid is fixed 22x22; output starts as bg-filled, then overlays objects without erasing prior placements (potential overlaps not handled explicitly).
 * Discovery key for sorting: (min_r of outer, min_c of topmost row positions) to process left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Subtle: Inners' positions may need 3-tuple (r,c,num) after open-top filling; adjacency checks use sets for efficiency but must avoid self-adjacency.
 * Easy to miss: Only merge if exactly one adjacent num and it matches a touching outer candidate; prevent double-merging with a merged set. For 2's, check bounds before placing to avoid index errors.
 * Background (bg) is g[0][0], assumed uniform; no diagonals in connectivity or adjacency.

**Previous attempts:**
 * The single attempt implemented blob extraction, object merging (outers with exactly one adj num), open-top filling for bg=0, and number-specific placement (packing for 8's, fixed bases for 2's), showing understanding of hierarchy and layout rules.
 * What worked: Correctly identifies atomic blobs via flood-fill; adjacency detection logic is sound; discovery sorting and delta-based packing for 8's handles row-wise left-packing without overlaps; 2's placement uses original position to choose base, which aligns with potential "sectioning" in the grid.
 * What didn't work: Crashed with "unhashable type: 'dict'" on all runs because merged=set() tries to add dict blobs directly (dicts aren't hashable); use IDs or positions tuples instead for tracking.
 * Object building skips merged blobs but doesn't handle multiple inners per outer fully (assumes one outer per inner); could loop inefficiently if many candidates.
 * Open-top filling modifies inner positions to 3-tuples but only if bg=0 and has_open_top—correct, but untested due to crash; assumes top row is min_r, which holds for connected blobs.
 * Placement for 2's lacks row-shifting (assumes same rows), potentially misaligning if original has vertical offset; no error handling for out-of-bounds in packing.
 * Standalone objects treated as outers without inners—good, but code adds them after merging loop.
 * Group_map by outer_num enables per-number handling, but other numbers' packing reuses current_right without reset, risking interference if mixed.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct for decomposing grid into components.
 * get_adj_nums and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for merging logic.
 * Building objects dicts with 'outer_blob' reference is unhelpful (leads to hash error); better to use indices or immutable keys.
 * Packing logic for 8's (deltas per row, update current_right) is helpful but complex—ensure occupied_rows sorted or handled per obj.
 * No unhelpful functions overall, but merged set approach is broken for dicts (fix by hashing positions or using list of IDs).

**Test output:**
 * No actual output generated for test input (or any training example) due to execution error on unhashable dict; instead, all return "ERROR - Execution error: unhashable type: 'dict'", which does not make sense or match expected rearranged grid.
 * Expected test output (mentally simulating rules): Assuming test grid has bg=0, composite objects like filled 8's (outer 8 with inner say 1's, open tops filled to 8), standalone 2's positioned left/right, and possibly other nums; output should pack 8-groups left in rows 0-21 cols 0+, place 2's shifted to cols 12/17 same rows, fill bg=0 elsewhere—no errors, fully placed without overlaps or clipping.
 * The error prevents verification, but if fixed, test might pass if merging correctly identifies e.g. a 2 with inner hole filled, placed at base 12 if originally left-side; differs from expectation by not producing grid at all (unknown if placement would align without seeing input, but hierarchy seems right).
 * Training examples 1-3 also errored identically, so no observed effects to compare—likely similar composites, but can't confirm if packing/2's rules would match without run.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of integers where the background value (typically at g[0][0]) separates connected "blobs" of the same number, identifying atomic connected components, merging inner blobs (those fully enclosed and not touching the background) into surrounding outer blobs, and then rearranging these merged "objects" into a new grid sorted by their top-left discovery position, placing each as high up as possible starting from the top row while avoiding overlaps and respecting the shapes.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up, down, left, right); diagonal connections do not count.
 * Background (bg) is the value at g[0][0], and blobs touching the grid edge or bg are considered outer/accessible; inner blobs must not touch bg or edges directly.
 * Merging only occurs if an inner blob is adjacent to exactly one outer blob's number and is fully enclosed (not touching bg); the inner blob's cells are added to the outer object's cells with the outer's number.
 * Special case when bg == 0: For inner blobs, add extra cells above the top row of the inner blob (where bg is present) and assign them the outer's number to "fill" potential holes or enclosures.
 * Discovery position for sorting: The topmost row's leftmost column of a blob's positions (min_r, then min_c among those).
 * Placement in output grid: Objects are placed in discovery order, starting from the current top row (initially 0), trying positions row-by-row and column-by-column to fit the object's bounding box without overwriting existing non-bg cells with mismatched numbers or going out of bounds; update current_r to the bottom of the placed object +1.
 * Output grid initializes to all bg; unmatched or empty objects are skipped.
 * Subtlety: When placing, relative offsets from the object's min_r/min_c must be preserved exactly to maintain shape; overlaps are allowed only if numbers match.
 * Edge case: Blobs with no positions or isolated inners without valid outers are ignored.
 * Potential miss: Inner blobs might need validation that they are truly enclosed (e.g., via flood-fill from bg not reaching them), but adjacency check is used as proxy.
 * Another subtlety: Multiple inners could merge into one outer, but code only handles one per outer; adj_nums ==1 ensures single outer.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly identifies core mechanics like blob extraction via connected components, inner-outer merging based on adjacency and non-bg-touching, special bg=0 filling above inners, discovery-based sorting, and top-down placement with overlap checks.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for finding all connected same-number regions excluding bg.
 * get_adj_nums, blobs_adjacent, get_discovery, and is_touching_bg are helpful for merging logic and validation; they correctly handle 4-connectivity and enclosure checks.
 * The overall structure (atomic blobs -> merge inners -> sort by discovery -> place sequentially from top) shows good understanding of object identification and rearrangement.
 * However, the program fails entirely due to a syntax error on line 128 in the placement loop: "max(nr for r, _, _ in cells with nr = try_r + (r - min_r_obj))" is invalid Python (misuses 'with' keyword and comprehension syntax; should be a max comprehension without 'with').
 * Merging logic only handles one inner per outer and assumes len(adj_nums)==1 strictly, which might miss multi-inner cases or fail if an inner touches multiple outers (though puzzle likely avoids that).
 * Placement tries every possible position exhaustively, which is correct but inefficient; it skips updating current_r properly due to the syntax error.
 * No handling for objects that can't be placed (they're skipped, which might be okay if puzzle guarantees fit).
 * The code includes unused 'original_min_c' in objects dict, which is not helpful.
 * get_discovery fallback to (rows, cols) for empty pos is a good edge case but untested due to error.

**Test output:**
 * No actual test output was generated in this attempt (or previous implied ones), as all training examples and test input resulted in "ERROR - Execution error: invalid syntax (<string>, line 128)", meaning the code crashes before producing any grid.
 * This differs from expected behavior: The puzzle requires a valid output grid with merged objects placed in order, preserving shapes and numbers, but the error prevents any execution, so nothing matches the anticipated rearranged grid (e.g., objects stacked top-to-bottom without gaps where possible).
 * Without running, we can't verify if merged shapes (e.g., filled inners) or placements (e.g., shifting right if blocked) are correct, but the syntax error ensures the test output is completely absent/invalid.
 * For the test input (mentally simulated: assuming a grid with bg=0, outer blobs enclosing inners, possibly touching edges), expected output should have inners merged into outers with possible top-fills, sorted by top-left, and placed starting row 0, shifting down/right as needed; the error means this doesn't happen, so it's incorrect by default.
 * Subtle issue: If test has bg!=0 or no inners, merging skips correctly, but again, untestable due to crash.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the input grid contains numbered regions (blobs) representing hierarchical "objects" (standalone shapes or outer shapes enclosing inner shapes), with a background value (often 0). The goal is to extract these objects while preserving their relative internal structure (outers and inners), sort them by their "discovery" order (top-left position in the input), and repack them into a new output grid as compactly as possible, filling from the top-left without overlaps or rotations, while maintaining the background fill.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically the most common value like 0, but can vary (e.g., 9 in test output); detect it as g[0][0] or the value surrounding objects.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number (using up/down/left/right directions); diagonal doesn't count.
 * Objects are hierarchical: "atomic blobs" are basic connected regions; "outers" enclose "inners" if inners don't touch bg and are adjacent to exactly one outer (not multiple or none); standalone objects are those touching bg or not fitting inner criteria.
 * Inners must be fully enclosed (not touching bg via any edge, including out-of-bounds as bg-touch); adjacency for enclosure is edge-sharing with the outer.
 * Sorting: Use "discovery" as the topmost row's leftmost column of the outer blob to order objects left-to-right, top-to-bottom.
 * Placement: Pack objects tightly into the output grid starting from top-left, advancing row-by-row; scan possible positions (row then column) to find the earliest fitting spot without overlap (output cells must be bg or match the number); if no fit, fallback to bottom-left, but this often fails compactness.
 * Subtleties: Relative positions are normalized to the outer's top-left (min_r, min_c); include all inner positions relative to this anchor. Preserve exact shapes—no rotation, scaling, or separation of inners from outers. Output must fill exactly like expected, often interweaving objects horizontally across rows for compactness (not just vertical stacking). Out-of-bounds in placement counts as bg-touch failure. Multiple inners per outer possible. Numbers like 1-9 represent colors/shapes; don't change them.
 * Easy to miss: Enclosure requires no bg-touch for inners, but outers can touch bg; if adj to >1 num, it's standalone (not inner). Discovery ignores inners—based only on outer. Packing must minimize empty space (e.g., place next object beside previous if fits in same rows). Fallback placement breaks compactness. Bg in output starts as full bg grid.
 * Across attempts: Extraction works for simple cases but fails hierarchy if blobs touch indirectly; placement ignores horizontal packing, leading to vertical stacks with excess bg.

The following are unhelpful or broken:
- `compute_max_extent`: Computes height/width but assumes rectangular bounding box; ignores irregular shapes, leading to inefficient scanning (still useful for bounds check, but overestimates space).
- Overall `program` placement loop: Scans from `current_r` downward, then left-to-right, but favors vertical stacking over horizontal packing; fallback to bottom-left creates disconnected layouts. Broken for compactness—doesn't try all positions or greedy fill.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the single provided attempt; it correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds basic hierarchy (e.g., identifies outers/inners via adj and touch checks), but fails on placement: generates vertical stacks of objects separated by bg rows/columns, ignoring horizontal adjacency for tight packing.
 * Train 1: Generated stacks 8-5, 2-1, 8-3, 2-3 vertically from top with excess 0s; expected interweaves them horizontally (e.g., 8-5 on left rows 1-5, then 2-1/2-3/8-3 filling right/mid rows compactly, plus extra objects like 2-9 not extracted/placed). Missed extracting all objects (e.g., standalone 2s, 8-6); hierarchy wrong (e.g., 3 as inner of 2 but placed separate).
 * Train 2: Generated vertical stacks of 2-5, 8-9, 2-3, 8-3 with 4 bg fill; expected more integrated (e.g., 4 bg base, then 2-5/8-9/2-3/8-3/2-6/8-1 packed across rows with horizontal overlaps in space). Failed to treat 4 as bg correctly; missed inners like 6 in 8, 1 in 8; sorting placed early objects too high, blocking later compact fits.
 * Train 3: Generated horizontal-ish but vertical-dominant stacks of 2-3, 8-2, 8-6, 2-5 with 1 fill; expected vertical flow but compact (e.g., 1 bg base, then 8-2/8-6/2-3/2-5/8-3 packed with inners preserved and side-by-side in rows). Misidentified bg as 1 (should be inferred); standalone 8-3 placed wrong; discovery sort ignored, leading to out-of-order placement.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works well for blob detection.
 * build_objects is partially essential but buggy (e.g., assumes single outer per inner; misses multi-level nesting or shared walls).
 * get_relative_positions is essential for shape preservation.
 * Placement logic (can_place_at/place_object) is essential but implemented wrongly—scans too linearly, doesn't greedy-pack horizontally first.
 * compute_max_extent is somewhat helpful for bounds but not critical; over-relies on it causes inefficient loops.
 * No prior attempts mentioned, but this attempt shows understanding of extraction (blobs/hierarchy) but zero on packing (always vertical, excess space).

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it stacks objects vertically (2-4 top, then 2-3, 8-4, 8-1) with full 9-fill rows/columns separating them, creating a tall, sparse layout similar to training fails.
 * It mismatches expected patterns: Expected would likely pack horizontally compactly (e.g., 2-4 beside 2-3 in shared rows, 8-4/8-1 filling gaps below, with 9 as bg but minimized empty space); instead, it's disconnected vertical bands, missing potential inners (e.g., if 3 inner of 2, not preserved relatively) and wrong bg (9 seems treated as fill, but input likely has 0/9 mixed—unknown why 9 dominates).
 * Does not make sense: Ignores sorting/discovery (e.g., 2-4 first but not anchored top-left tightly); no horizontal scanning for fits, leading to waste; if test input has enclosures (e.g., 1 inner of 8), they're not placed relatively. To handle test, need better packing: try positions starting from (0,0) globally per object, not advancing `current_r` rigidly—use earliest row/col fit across whole grid.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid-based image processing where numbered cells represent colored blobs or shapes on a background, and the goal is to detect, extract, and rearrange composite "objects" (outers with possible inners) from an input grid into a standardized 22x22 output grid following specific stacking and placement rules, likely to form a coherent visual pattern or solve a reassembly challenge.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from the top-left cell; all non-bg connected components (blobs) of the same number are treated as atomic units via flood-fill (4-directional connectivity).
 * Objects are composites: only outers with numbers 2 or 8 that fully enclose exactly one type of inner blob (not touching bg, adjacent only to that outer), and inners must be fully surrounded without other adjacencies.
 * Placement rules are complex: output is 22x22 initialized to bg; objects are grouped by outer_num (2 or 8); within groups, sort by row/col and place sequentially, preferring to stack vertically if touching/overlapping previous, or start new "stack" in fixed columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position); check for "top_open" (non-solid top edge in input) and add lids if stacking; handle shifts to avoid overlap and fit within bounds; update current max_r and right edge for stacking decisions.
 * Subtleties: Blobs touching bg are not inners; adjacency checks must ignore self and bg; no diagonal connectivity; for 2's, column choice depends on original min_c (<9 -> col 12, else 17); lids only added if top_open and not new stack; ensure no out-of-bounds writes; potential for multiple inners per outer, but only if all share the same outer.
 * Easy to miss: Global 'g' reference in nested functions causes scope errors; input grid size varies (not always 22x22), but output is fixed; blob bounding boxes for width calc; sorting groups by min_r then min_c for order; no rotation or flipping—preserve orientation; unused inners or outers are ignored; possible empty groups.

```python
def place_obj(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], obj: Dict, shift_r: int, shift_c: int):
    # Places outer and its inners into output grid with shifts; bounds-checked writes.
    # Helpful in concept, but relies on external 'g' in caller—could be improved by passing input grid if needed for validation.

def place_group(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], group: List[Dict], outer_num: int):
    # Handles sequential placement/stacking logic for a group; includes top_open/lid logic and column basing.
    # Broken: References undefined global 'g' in top_open check (line: if 0 <= c < len(g) and g[top_r][c] != outer_num); uses input g for solidity check but g not passed/defined in scope—causes execution error. Also, lid placement assumes shift_r=0 always (hardcoded). Sorting and stacking logic seems correct but untested due to error. Not fully helpful until fixed; core placement but fragile.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first (and only) attempt shown; it demonstrates good understanding of blob extraction and object composition but fails entirely on execution due to scope error with 'g' in place_group.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and build_objects are solid and essential for decomposing the input into reusable objects—worked in isolation but untested.
 * place_group is the main failure point: ambitious stacking/lid logic captures puzzle subtleties (e.g., conditional columns, top_open detection), but the undefined 'g' (intended for input grid solidity check) crashes everything; this is a simple fix (pass g as param) but indicates incomplete scoping.
 * No successful runs, so no partial outputs to analyze; all attempts (training 1-3 and test) produced identical errors, meaning no grid generation at all—expected rearranged 22x22 with placed objects, but got none.
 * groups defaultdict and sorting by (min_r, min_c) seem correct for ordering; base_func for columns handles 8 vs 2 differentiation well.
 * No mismatches in blob shapes or omissions noted (since no output), but logic filters out invalid inners correctly in theory.

**Test output:**
 * The test output (and all training outputs) is an execution error ("name 'g' is not defined"), so no grid is generated—completely incorrect, as the puzzle requires a valid 22x22 output grid with rearranged objects placed per rules.
 * Expected: A populated 22x22 grid with bg-filled, objects from input (outers 2/8 with inners) stacked in columns (e.g., 8's at col 0, 2's at 12/17), possibly with lids on open tops, preserving shapes/orientation, and empty space as bg; the error produces nothing, so it misses all placement, stacking, and enclosure handling.
 * Does not make sense: Zero progress on visual reassembly; the error is superficial (scope), but reveals the placement logic isn't robust (e.g., why check input g for top_open during output placement? Should compute top_open from blob data alone to avoid needing g).
 * To handle test: Fix 'g' scope by passing input grid to place_group or refactor top_open to use blob positions/bounding box instead of raw g access; verify against test input (unknown here, but assume it has multiple 2/8 objects with inners needing stacking without overflow).

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 4/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves processing a grid of numbers representing shapes or "objects" (like containers or blobs formed by connected cells of the same number), extracting atomic connected components (blobs), identifying composite objects (e.g., an outer shell of 2 or 8 containing an inner filling like 1,3,4,5,6,9), and then reassembling these objects in a new output grid by stacking them in columns based on their outer type (8 on the left, 2 on the right), simulating gravity-like placement where objects stack vertically, connect if tops and bottoms align solidly, and start new stacks if needed, while preserving inner/outer distinctions and handling open tops specially.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is typically 0 but can vary (e.g., 1 in train 3, 4 or 9 in others); always detect it from g[0][0] and ignore it for blob extraction.
 * Blobs are 4-connected (up/down/left/right) groups of the same non-bg number; track min/max row/col for bounding boxes and positions for adjacency checks.
 * Objects are either simple (outer 2 or 8 with no inner) or composite (inner blob like 5 adjacent to outer 2/8); only consider inners adjacent to exactly one outer type (prioritize max adjacency count for 2/8), and mark "is_open_top" if the inner's top row is fully bg-exposed (for special placement rules like filling with outer on open tops).
 * Stacking rules: Sort objects by min_r then min_c; place in groups by outer_num (8 first at col 0, then 2 at cols 12 or 17 based on original position <9 or not); for each object, check if it touches/overlaps previous stack (is_touch if min_r == current_max_r +1, is_overlap if min_r <= current_max_r); if connectable (solid top on new obj + solid bottom on previous stack), shift up by -1 row; otherwise, place at row 0 or start new stack; fill gaps horizontally with outer_num if touching without shifting; track current_max_r, current_right, and stack_min_col to prevent overflow (grid cols=22).
 * Subtle placement: In place_obj, for open-top inners, fill top inner row with outer_num if shifted; ensure out grid starts as all bg; only place 2/8 outers, ignore others unless inner.
 * Easy to miss: Adjacency for building objects requires checking all neighbor cells of inner positions for outer nums (2/8), counting touches; multiple inners can merge to one outer if touching same outer blob; solid_top check must verify entire top row of obj is outer_num (or open-top condition); bottom solid check scans previous row's relevant cols for outer_num; new stacks for 2 use different base cols (12 if original_min_c <9, else 17) to separate left/right groups; prevent out-of-bounds placement; preserve exact shapes without rotation or scaling.
 * Physics-like stacking: Objects "fall" to row 0 initially but shift up only if fully supportable; if width causes overflow, force new stack; after placement, update current_max_r/max_c globally per group.
 * Grid size: Always 22x22? Inputs are lists of 22 lists with 22 ints; output same size, all bg init.
 * Other: No diagonals for connectivity; used set prevents reprocessing blobs; sort objects before placing.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt correctly extracts atomic blobs and builds some composite objects (e.g., 5 inside 8, 4 inside 8), grouping by outer_num (8 and 2) and attempting stacking with shifts/fills.
 * What worked: Basic connected component detection via extract_atomic_blobs; adjacency checks for inners/outers; initialization of out as bg; sorting objects for placement order; base column logic for 2's (12/17 split); some gap filling and open-top handling.
 * What didn't work: Stacking logic buggy—e.g., in train 1, 3's placed separately instead of stacking under previous 8's (expected connects 3's to row 6 under 8's, but generated keeps them detached at row 8); open_top detection assumes bg=0 (fails if bg=1/4/9); solid_top/is_solid_top often false-negatives, preventing shifts (e.g., train 1 row 6 expected has 3's shifted up but generated doesn't); bottom check all_prev_bottom scans wrong range or misses partial supports; in train 2, 3's and 6's misaligned (generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected shifts them right/under; row 19 expected has 6's shifted up into 8's but generated doesn't); train 3 completely wrong layout (generated keeps original-ish positions with 1's as bg? but expected rotates/stacks 2's/3's/6's vertically on right, fills left with 1's); place_obj overwrites inners incorrectly on shifts (e.g., train 1 bottom 4's have wrong inner placement); new_stack detection too aggressive, causing unnecessary side-by-side instead of vertical stacking; candidates in build_objects only check 2/8 but may miss if inner touches other nums first; used set misses multi-blob merges.
 * Train 1: Generated has detached 3's at rows 8-10 (expected stacked at row 6 under 8's); bottom 4's stacked wrong (generated row 17 has 4's but expected row 17 has 3's? Wait, no—expected row 17: 2,4,4,4,2 but generated has 2,0,0,0,2—unknown why zeros, perhaps no inner detected); 9's misplaced in right stack.
 * Train 2: Generated row 5 has 3's under 2's but expected empty/ shifted; row 19 expected 4,4,4,... with 6's up but generated has 2,2,2,... no shift; row 6 generated full 4's bottom but expected partial.
 * Train 3: Generated mostly preserves input layout with 1's as fill/bg but expected major rearrangement (e.g., top 2's become right stack, 6's under 8's on left, 3's/4's/5's stacked vertically); unknown why no stacking occurs—perhaps bg=1 confuses extraction.
 * Function `is_solid_top` is helpful but buggy (hardcodes outer_num check, misses open_top for non-row0 mins); `place_group` core but flawed in shift_r logic (only -1 or 0, no full gravity drop; all_prev_bottom assumes full outer_num span but partial supports possible); `place_obj` useful for pos shifting but inner placement conditional is_open_top + r==inner_min_r fails if shifted.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct; it appears to treat 9 as a filler/bg (spreading everywhere) but places 8/2 structures partially, with misalignments like 4's not stacking under 8's properly (rows 3-5: 8's over 9's, expected likely shifts 4's up); right side 3's at rows 17-20 detached/spread into 9's (expected vertical stack like train 1/2); top rows have 9's overwriting potential outers; 1's tiny blob at rows 7-10 misplaced/not extracted as inner; overall no clear left-8/right-2 columns, gaps filled wrong (e.g., row 15: 2,9,9,9,2 instead of solid 2's); looks like bg detection works (9?) but stacking fails entirely, similar to train 3—probably open_top or solid checks broken for this bg/input shapes; does not match expected physics-stacking (e.g., 3's should stack under previous, not float).

**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving grid manipulation where "objects" composed of outer blobs (numbers 2 or 8) enclosing inner non-background numbers are extracted from an input grid and rearranged into a new output grid. The rearrangement stacks these objects horizontally by type (8s first, then 2s), with rules for shifting up if they touch solidly, merging gaps, and preserving inners, while treating the background (e.g., 1 or 9) as empty space.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background value is extracted from the top-left cell and used to identify non-background elements; it varies (1 in training, 9 in test), so must be dynamic.
 * Blobs are 4-connected components of the same number, excluding background; each blob tracks positions, number, and bounding box (min/max row/col) for placement and adjacency checks.
 * Only outer blobs of 2 or 8 can form "objects"; inners are non-2/8 blobs fully enclosed by exactly one such outer (no touching background or edges, adjacent only to one outer num).
 * Objects exclude inners that are themselves used as outers to avoid nesting beyond one level.
 * Placement: Initialize output with background; place 8-objects first, then 2-objects. Stack horizontally: sort by row then col; if objects overlap rows or touch (next row), place adjacent/right of previous; if gap, start new stack at base column (0 for 8s, 12 or 17 for 2s based on original position <9 or not).
 * Subtle shifting: If touching (min_r == prev max_r +1) and not new stack, check if object's top row is solid outer_num in input AND previous stack's bottom row is solid outer_num in output; if both, shift up by -1 row (overlap vertically).
 * Gap filling: If shifted horizontally without up-shift on touch, fill the bottom row gap between stacks with outer_num.
 * Adjacency is 4-directional (up/down/left/right); touching background/edge disqualifies inners; self-num ignored in adj checks.
 * Bounds checking during placement to avoid out-of-grid writes.
 * Sorting groups by (min_r, min_c) before placement to process top-to-bottom, left-to-right.
 * Subtleties: "Solid top" checks input grid's top bounding row for continuous outer_num within bounds (but clips to grid cols); "solid bottom" checks output's previous max_r row within current stack's col range. Base cols for 2s depend on original position to separate left/right groups. No rotation or resizing; preserve exact shapes/inners.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it succeeded on training examples 1 and 2 (exact match to expected outputs, correctly extracting/placing objects with inners and stacking).
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output places the inner 2-blob (rows 2-4, cols 1-3) inside the top 8-object as 1's (background) instead of preserving as 2's, e.g., generated row 2: [8,1,1,1,8,...] vs. expected [8,2,2,2,8,...]; same for rows 3-4. Bottom 8-object with inner 3's is correct. This suggests a bug in inner placement or object building for certain enclosed 2's (possibly misclassifying the inner 2 as not enclosed or not associating it properly, unknown exact cause but it fails to copy inner num during place_obj).
 * The lower sections (e.g., 6-in-8, 5-in-2, 4-in-2, 3-in-8) are placed correctly with stacking and no up-shifts.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and works (correctly finds all blobs/positions/bounds).
 * find_inners works partially (detects some inners like 3's and 6's but misses or mishandles the top inner 2).
 * build_objects is likely the issue (may exclude or not associate the inner 2 correctly, perhaps due to used_as_inner logic or outer detection).
 * place_group handles stacking/touching well for non-problematic objects but inherits inner placement errors from build.
 * touches_bg and get_adj_nums are helpful and seem correct (enclosure checks pass for most cases).
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj (not fully shown) may need bounds-checked inner writes verified.
 * Base column logic (12/17 for 2s) works for separating left/right groups in training 3.

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look fully correct based on puzzle rules; while it extracts and places most objects (e.g., 8-with-4 inner at top-left, 8-with-1-and-7 at mid-left, 2-with-3/6 at bottom-right), there are anomalies: the top 2-object with 4-inner is split oddly (row 2 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 3 has 2,4,4,4,2 followed by extra 2's that seem like a misplaced fragment; row 1 has 9's in place of expected stacking). Inners like 3-in-2 at bottom are preserved but positioning overlaps strangely (e.g., row 17 has 2,3,3,3,2 over previous 2's without clear stacking). Background 9 is handled, but no up-shifts or gap fills appear applied (e.g., no vertical merging for touching objects like the 8-with-4 and below 8's). It mismatches expected behavior by not fully stacking horizontally (e.g., 2-objects seem pushed right without base col separation, leading to col 12+ overlaps). Overall, it partially follows rules but likely fails on inner association or shift conditions similar to training 3 error.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 6/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle involving the extraction of nested "objects" (connected blobs of numbers, specifically outers made of 2 or 8 containing inner blobs) from an input grid, then rearranging and stacking these objects into a standardized 22x22 output grid with background fill (1 or 9), following rules for positioning, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate a compact, layered composition without overlaps or excessive spacing.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Objects are defined as atomic connected components (blobs) of the same number, excluding background (bg, e.g., 1 or 9); inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob of type 2 or 8, not touching bg or other numbers.
 * Stacking occurs separately for 8-objects (first) and 2-objects (second), sorted by row then column; new stacks start at specific columns (0 for 8, 12 or 17 for 2 based on original position), with vertical shifts (-1 row up) only if the current object's top fully matches the previous stack's bottom in outer material and no overlap.
 * Gap-filling: When stacking adjacently (touching but not overlapping), fill horizontal gaps at the connection row with outer material; prevent horizontal overflows by starting new stacks if width exceeds remaining space (max col 21).
 * Subtleties: Blobs must be 4-connected (up/down/left/right); inners skip if adjacent to multiple outers or non-2/8; placement ignores out-of-bounds but doesn't clip; original min_c influences base column for 2-objects (<9 -> col 12, else 17); all-top-outer and all-prev-bottom checks are crucial for upward shifts but only apply to touching non-new-stacks.
 * Easy-to-miss: Background varies (1 in train, 9 in test); self_num exclusion in adjacency checks; no diagonal connections; objects without valid inners or touching bg are ignored; sorting and current_stack_min_col tracking prevent misalignment in multi-object stacks.
 * Across attempts: No rotation or scaling; preserve inner/outer numbers exactly; output is always 22x22; handle cases where objects span multiple rows/cols with min/max bounding boxes for placement.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the only submission shown; it correctly handled training examples 1 and 2 (full match to expected outputs), successfully extracting nested objects and stacking with shifts/fills.
 * Failed on training example 3: Generated output has incorrect placements, e.g., row 2 [8,1,1,1,8,...] instead of expected [8,2,2,2,8,...] (1's where 2's should be, suggesting a 2-object was not shifted up or gap not filled properly); row 3/4 similar mismatches with 1's persisting; row 14 has 1's where expected has nothing specified but pattern implies outer extension; overall, stacking logic misapplies upward shifts or adjacency checks for 2-objects, leading to unfilled gaps treated as bg (1).
 * Differences in train 3 are specific to 2-object placements (e.g., a vertical 2-blob in cols 2-4 rows 2-4 is replaced by 1's in generated, indicating failure to detect/place an inner or outer correctly); unknown why 1's appear instead of 2's—possibly flawed all_top_outer check using input g instead of tracking placed state, or incorrect blob adjacency.
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and place_group are essential and mostly correct (worked for train 1/2), but place_group's shift_r condition (all_top_outer on input g) is broken for multi-object interactions as it doesn't reflect the evolving output state.
 * touches_bg and blobs_adjacent are helpful and accurate for isolation checks.
 * build_objects is useful for structuring but skips non-2/8, which is correct.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though place_obj could be enhanced to avoid overwriting (but doesn't in this case).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output (with bg=9) mostly follows the stacking pattern from train 3 expected, placing 8-objects left/center and 2-objects right, with some nesting (e.g., 4's inside 8's at rows 3-6 cols 0-4; 3's inside 2's at rows 17-20 cols 12-16), and gap-fills visible (e.g., row 2 cols 17-21 as 2's).
 * It does not look fully correct: Several potential misplacements, e.g., row 3 has [8,8,8,8,8,9,...,2,4,4,4,2,2,2,2,2,2] but includes extra 2's in cols 17-21 that might be unfilled gaps or incorrect extension; row 8 has 8's extending into col 10-14 unexpectedly, possibly from a merged stack without proper new_stack trigger; row 16 has 2's in cols 12-16 with 3's, but row 17 shifts to [8,3,3,3,8,...] which aligns but may miss an upward shift similar to train 3 error (3's appear where bg=9 should if not filled).
 * Compared to train 3 expected patterns, test output has analogous issues: Persistent bg (9) where outers should extend (e.g., row 5 col 12-16 as 9's instead of potential 2's); inner 1's in rows 9-11 cols 6-8 inside 8's look correct, but 7's in cols 11-13 may be misplaced if not fully enclosed; overall, stacking seems to start new stacks too early (e.g., 2-objects at col 12 but with overflows), and no upward shifts observed, leading to vertical spacing that doesn't compact touching objects—does not match the tight nesting in train expected (e.g., no -1 row shifts applied).
 * To handle test: Account for bg=9; ensure all_top_outer checks use placed output state, not input g; verify width calculations prevent col>21 overflows by forcing new stacks earlier; test output misses compacting for touching 8/2 groups, resulting in looser layout than expected tight composition.

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 7/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This is a visual puzzle where the goal is to parse a grid of numbered cells (representing shapes or blobs) into composite "objects" consisting of outer enclosures (specifically numbers 2 or 8) and their fully enclosed inner blobs, then reassemble these objects in a new output grid by grouping and stacking them horizontally and vertically in designated column ranges, connecting adjacent objects where their edges align to form continuous structures while preserving inner details.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background is always the value at grid[0][0] (9 in examples); all non-background connected components of the same number form "atomic blobs" via flood-fill, tracking positions, bounds (min/max row/col), but excluding background-touching blobs for inner detection.
 * Inner blobs must be fully enclosed by exactly one outer blob (only 2 or 8 qualify as outers), not touch the background, and be adjacent only to that single outer number; multiple adjacents or background contact disqualifies them as inners.
 * Objects are built only from unused outer blobs (2 or 8) that aren't themselves inners; inners are associated per outer via index lists.
 * Placement separates groups by outer number: 8-objects stack starting from column 0 (left side); 2-objects stack starting from column 12 (if original min_c < 9) or 17 (otherwise, suggesting left/middle vs. right-side originals in input).
 * Stacking logic sorts objects by min_r then min_c; attempts vertical connection (shift_r = -1) only if the new object's top row is all outer_num and the previous stack's bottom is all outer_num in overlapping columns; otherwise places at shift_r=0; fills horizontal gaps in the connection row with outer_num if touching without shift.
 * New stacks start if not touching/overlapping previous or if width exceeds remaining columns; updates current max_r, rightmost col, and stack min_col for overlap checks.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency for enclosure checks uses 4-directional (up/down/left/right); blob extraction uses stack-based DFS for efficiency; placement bounds-checks to avoid out-of-grid writes; no rotation or scaling—positions are relative and shifted directly.
 * Easy-to-miss: Inners can be any non-bg/non-outer number (e.g., 1,3,4,6,7); objects preserve exact relative positions including inners; filling gaps only happens on touch without vertical shift; original_min_c determines 2-object column base, implying input layout influences output positioning.
 * Considerations across attempts: Handle multiple inners per outer; avoid using background or non-qualifying blobs as objects; ensure no overlap in placement beyond intended connections; track used inners to prevent double-use; sort groups for consistent top-to-bottom, left-to-right stacking.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the only one provided) correctly handled all three training examples, successfully extracting blobs, identifying inners for outers 2/8, building objects, and placing them with stacking logic that connects where tops/bottoms are uniform outer_num.
 * Worked well for simple enclosures and stacking without overlaps; base column logic (0 for 8, 12/17 for 2 based on original position) preserved input-side distinctions.
 * Potential issue in vertical shift check: the all_top_outer check references original g (input grid), but should verify the object's own top row in its positions (not g[obj_min_r], as g may have inners or gaps); this could cause incorrect -1 shifts if input top isn't pure outer.
 * Gap filling only on touch without shift, but may overfill if columns don't align perfectly; no handling for diagonal touches or 8-connectivity.
 * Innermost detection skips bg-touching correctly, but assumes single outer adjacency—may miss complex enclosures with multiple layers.
 * build_objects skips used inners properly, avoiding recursion.
 * Overall, blob extraction and adjacency functions are solid and essential; place_group is core but has subtle bugs in connection checks referencing wrong grid.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output shows multiple 8-object stacks on the left (columns 0-5, with inners like 4,3,1,7), a central 2-object stack around columns 12-17 (with inners 4,3,6), and a right-side 2-stack around columns 17-21 (with inners 3,6); background 9 fills the rest, with some extensions like row 3-4 2's protruding right.
 * It does not look fully correct: Several placements show incomplete connections, e.g., row 4 has 8,4,4,4,8 but adjacent rows have gaps or misalignments (row 5 has 8,4,4,4,8 but then jumps to 9's); the central 2-stack in rows 1-3 has 2,4,4,4,2 but row 0 above it has 2,2,2,2,2 without inner, suggesting failed vertical shift or gap fill—expected seamless stacking if tops/bottoms match.
 * Right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show stacking with inners 6 and 3, but row 16 has 2,3,3,3,2 overlapping a previous 2,6,6,6,2 without full connection (gaps in row 17-18), differing from expected by not filling horizontal gaps properly or shifting up.
 * Bottom rows (20-21) have isolated 8's and 9's, but upper rows like 7-8 show wide 8's without inners, possibly correct but the overall structure has jagged edges where smooth connections were expected; unknown why some 2's extend into column 21 in row 3 without support.
 * No obvious missing objects (all numbers 1-8 appear placed), but placements seem shifted incorrectly in vertical stacks, leading to overlaps or gaps not filled with outer_num.

MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 8/10

=== Attempt ===
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid of numbers representing colored shapes or blobs on a background (9), extracting atomic connected components, identifying composite "objects" consisting of outer blobs (specifically numbers 2 or 8) that fully enclose inner blobs without the inners touching the background, and then rearranging these objects into a new output grid by grouping similar outers, sorting them spatially, and stacking them horizontally in designated columns with rules for vertical alignment, shifting, and gap-filling to simulate physical stacking or assembly.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Blobs are 4-connected regions of the same number (up, down, left, right; no diagonals), excluding the background (9).
 * Only outers with number 2 or 8 are considered for objects; inners must be fully enclosed by exactly one such outer, not touch the background, and be adjacent to it.
 * Objects may have multiple inners, but inners cannot themselves be outers (no nesting beyond one level).
 * In placement, groups of objects with the same outer number are sorted by their original min_r then min_c.
 * Stacking logic: Objects are placed starting in base columns (0 for 8; 12 if original min_c <9 else 17 for 2), forming vertical stacks if they touch or overlap the previous object's bottom; new stacks start if no connection.
 * Subtle shifting: If an object touches the previous stack's bottom row and its own top row is fully contiguous (no holes in the top edge) while the previous bottom is fully filled with the outer number in the relevant columns, shift the new object up by 1 row (shift_r = -1) to simulate embedding or tight stacking.
 * Gap filling: When stacking without upward shift (shift_r=0) and touching, fill any horizontal gaps between the previous right edge and new object's left with the outer number to connect them seamlessly.
 * Bounds checking: Placements clip to grid size; no overwriting if out of bounds, but this can lead to partial objects if miscalculated.
 * Order of placement: Process 8-groups first, then 2-groups, on a fresh background-filled grid.
 * Easy to miss: Original position influences base column for 2's (left or right side based on min_c <9), suggesting the puzzle simulates a two-sided assembly (e.g., left for one "page", right for another).
 * No rotation or scaling: Objects retain exact relative positions and shapes.
 * Background propagation: Output starts fully as background; only placed pixels are overwritten.
 * Potential for multiple stacks per group if widths cause overflow beyond column 21.

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
from typing import List, Dict, DefaultDict
from collections import defaultdict

directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]  # 4-connected neighbors

def get_bg(g: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    return g[0][0]  # Assumes uniform background

def extract_atomic_blobs(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    # Extracts all connected components (blobs) of non-bg numbers, including bounds and positions.
    # Uses DFS with stack for flood-fill; tracks min/max r/c for bounding box.
    # Returns list of dicts with 'num', 'positions' (list of (r,c)), 'min_r', 'max_r', 'min_c', 'max_c'.
    # Helpful for identifying all potential inners and outers without assuming structure.
```

```python
def touches_bg(positions: List[tuple], g: List[List[int]], bg: int, rows: int, cols: int) -> bool:
    # Checks if any position in the blob (or its 4-neighbors) touches background or grid edge (edge counts as bg touch).
    # Essential for distinguishing enclosed inners from outer-touching or bg-adjacent blobs.

def blobs_adjacent(pos1: List[tuple], pos2: List[tuple]) -> bool:
    # Checks if two blobs share an edge (4-neighbor adjacency between any positions).
    # Used to confirm inner is adjacent to its outer.

def find_inners(g: List[List[int]], bg: int, atomic_blobs: List[Dict]) -> DefaultDict[int, List[int]]:
    # For each non-bg, non-outer blob, checks if it's fully enclosed: touches exactly one outer (2 or 8) via adjacency, no other numbers, no bg touch.
    # Returns dict mapping outer blob index to list of inner blob indices.
    # Key subtlety: Ignores self-num in adjacency check; only considers 2/8 as valid outers.

def build_objects(atomic_blobs: List[Dict], inners_for_outer: DefaultDict[int, List[int]]) -> List[Dict]:
    # Builds object dicts for valid outers (2/8 not used as inners), including their inners list, positions, bounds, and original min_c (for placement basing).
    # Filters out inners-as-outer cases to prevent double-use.

def place_obj(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], obj: Dict, shift_r: int, shift_c: int):
    # Places an object (outer + all inners) at shifted position, overwriting output grid cells within bounds.
    # Clips to grid; no error if partial.

def place_group(out: List[List[int]], atomic: List[Dict], group: List[Dict], outer_num: int):
    # Core placement: Sorts group by original position; iterates to place in stacks.
    # Base col: 0 for 8; for 2, 12 if original_min_c <9 else 17.
    # Detects touch (min_r == prev_max_r +1) or overlap (min_r <= prev_max_r); else new stack.
    # If overflow in current stack, force new stack.
    # Up-shift (-1 row) only if touch, top row fully solid in object, and prev bottom fully outer_num in stack's col range.
    # Post-place fill: If no shift but touch, fill horizontal gap with outer_num at prev_max_r.
    # Updates stack tracking (current_max_r, current_right, current_stack_min_col).
    # Handles multiple objects per group, potential multi-stack.
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * This attempt (the provided program) successfully handled all three training examples, correctly extracting blobs, identifying inners (e.g., 4 inside 2/8, 1/7 inside 8, 3/6 inside 2), building objects, and placing groups with stacking/shifting/filling, resulting in correct rearrangements.
 * Worked well for simple single-object or basic stacking cases in training, preserving shapes, enclosures, and relative positions while simulating assembly on left (8's) and right (2's) sides.
 * What didn't work: In complex test cases with multiple stacks or wide objects, the gap-filling might overfill (e.g., extending outer_num beyond intended connections), and the up-shift condition could fail if "fully covered" check misses irregular top edges (e.g., if object's top has gaps due to inner protrusion).
 * The base column logic for 2's (12 vs 17 based on original min_c <9) worked for training but might misplace if test has objects originally spanning the threshold ambiguously.
 * extract_atomic_blobs is essential and correct: accurately finds all blobs without merging different numbers.
 * touches_bg is helpful and precise: correctly identifies enclosed inners by checking positions and neighbors.
 * find_inners is key but subtle: requires exactly one adjacent outer (2/8) and no bg touch; skips if multiple adjacents, preventing wrong enclosures.
 * build_objects correctly avoids using inners as outers, but could miss if an outer has no inners (still valid object).
 * place_group's stacking logic worked for training touches/overlaps but might not handle non-rectangular "full coverage" perfectly (e.g., if prev bottom has holes from prior inners).
 * No unhelpful functions in this attempt; all provided are relevant, though the fill logic in place_group could be refined to check for actual gap presence rather than always filling between edges.
 * Overall, the program demonstrates good understanding of blob extraction and object hierarchy, but placement subtleties (shift conditions, fills) may need tuning for irregular shapes in test.

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places objects in a structured way: top-left has an 8-outer with 4-inner (rows 3-7, cols 0-4, shifted/clipped); adjacent 2-group with 4/3-inners stacked around cols 12-17 (rows 0-5); mid-bottom has another 8 with 1/7-inners (rows 8-12, cols 5-15); lower-right has 2-group with 6/3-inners (rows 13-20, cols 17-21), with some fills like extended 2's in row 2 cols 12-21.
 * It makes sense overall: Groups 8's on left/mid, 2's on right, with stacking (e.g., the lower 2's touch and connect without shift, filling gaps with 2's); enclosures preserved (4 inside 2/8, etc.); background 9 elsewhere.
 * However, it does not look fully correct: In the top 2-group (rows 0-5, cols 12-17+), the 4-inner in row 1 cols 13-15 overlaps the outer 2's but protrudes oddly without full enclosure in output (e.g., row 0 has 2's but no inner below, suggesting missed up-shift or fill); similarly, lower 8-group (rows 16-20, cols 0-4) has 3-inner but row 17 col 1-3 is 3's adjacent to bg 9 without outer cover, implying failed enclosure preservation or clipping error.
 * The right-side 2's in rows 13-20 show good stacking (6-inner enclosed, 3's stacked below with touch-fill), but the base col 17 placement causes slight overflow (e.g., row 15 col 21 is 2, but grid is 22 cols indexed 0-21, so okay, but looks tight).
 * Differences from expected: Expected tighter vertical integration (more up-shifts for embedded looks) and no bg exposure for inners; observed has some loose connections (e.g., row 4 col 17-21 has 2's and 3's but gaps to bg), possibly due to incomplete fill or shift misfire on irregular shapes; also, multiple 3-inners suggest test has complex objects, but output merges stacks suboptimally, leaving horizontal 9's in row 20 cols 12-16 unused.
 * The output preserves counts (e.g., two 8-objects, multiple 2's with varied inners), but positioning feels shifted right for some 2's compared to base logic, hinting at overflow forcing extra stacks without reset.

Unlike the training pairs, there is no test output to compare against, so THINK about if the generated output above makes sense and looks valid. If the test output does not look valid, make sure to update the program, specifying how to produce the correct test output.

Based on this feedback, refine your program. Think about what worked and what didn't, then output an NEW and IMPROVED program. You will get many attempts to generate programs, so try NEW approaches, different from the previously generated programs. Be creative. Try out of the box approaches. Test things that you think might work.

Output a python program to solve this puzzle. Avoid nested loops and nested control flow. Create one function per transformation, rule, or observation. Make sure each function is self contained. Do not output a monolithic program, instead output a program that composes individual rules. Make sure each function clearly describes what observation or rule it is handling.

REQUIRED OUTPUT:
* Define **exactly**: `def program(g: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:`
* Use only the standard library. **No I/O**, no `__main__`, no demo code.
* Output the program as text.

Other considerations:
* A sample of inputs and outputs is provided in a pretty printed format.
* This is every input that the program will be run on. 
* IMPORTANT: pay special attention to the TEST input, this is the only one that will be scored. The train inputs are just for reference.


IMPORTANT: only output the program, do not output anything else, do not output any reasoning or explanation.

You previously generated the following program which generated the following outputs:
Program:
```python
from typing import List, Dict, DefaultDict, Tuple
from collections import defaultdict

    return g[0][0]

def extract_atomic_blobs(g: List[List[int]], bg: int) -> List[Dict]:
    rows: int = len(g)
    cols: int = len(g[0])

    **Think** about the correct output for the test input. Mentally run the puzzle rules and considerations over the test input grid and think about what the output should be and if the generated output matches. If it does not match, think about how best to update the program to handle the test input.
    

YOUR TASK: summarize the above attempts, summarize what worked, and what did not work. Summarize the problem as you understand it. Call out the high level puzzle rules as well as subtle elements of the puzzle that are easy to miss. Include all considerations across all attempts. Include helpful functions from attempts, such as functions to extract objects. 

IMPORTANT: Be specific and list the observe effects (what was generated) and how they are different from what you expected. It's okay to say you don't know why something is different, but make sure to note that it IS different.

You can include unhelpful functions, so that we don't use them in future attempts. Make sure to make it clear when a function is either broken or not helpful to the problem.

IMPORTANT: look at the generated test outputs. The generated test outputs are the MOST IMPORTANT. Do the test outputs make sense? Do they look correct? If they do not look correct, explain why they are not correct.

IMPORTANT: grade this attempt at the end. You must match the grading format EXACTLY: "MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: 10/10". Grading is always out of 10. A perfect score means that the training samples all passed and the test makes sense. A 0/10 should be a complete lack of understanding of the problem.  

OUTPUT FORMAT: Below is an example of what you should output. Make sure to include every section. Follow this format exactly.

============= EXAMPLE OUTPUT =============
**High level:** this is a puzzle that... (one-two sentences)

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Omit objects that...
 * Make sure you match....
 * And so on...

**Helpful functions, types, and tools:**
```python
class PuzzleElement:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hole_count = ...
```

```python
def extract_objects(g: List[List[int]]) -> PuzzleElement:
    return ...
```

**Previous attempts:**
 * Missed ommission of objects with hole count not in key
 * Consider problems where key component does not stretch across the entire grid
 * Missed X
 * extract_objects is essential for Y
 * Train 1 omitted the devider bar
 * Train 1 mismatches blob shape for unkown reason (it's okay to say it's unknown)
 * Function `extract_objects` is incorrect or not relevant to the puzzle (don't use it in the future)

**Test output:**
 * The test output does not look correct in any attempt
 * The test output is missing X and Y
 * Make sure to account for keys with ... to handle test case

 MARK ATTEMPT GRADE: X/10


[2025-09-30 20:02:23] Response:
**High level:** This puzzle involves parsing a grid to identify "atomic" connected blobs of numbers (excluding background), then composing them into "objects" where outer blobs (specifically numbers 2 or 8) may enclose inner blobs, and finally reconstructing a new output grid by stacking these objects in designated column ranges (left for 8s, right for 2s), with rules for vertical shifting, gap filling, and ensuring solid connections between stacked pieces.

**Details, subtleties, key considerations:**
 * Background (bg) is determined from the top-left cell; all non-bg connected components (blobs) of the same number are extracted using flood-fill (DFS with stack), tracking positions, bounding boxes (min/max r/c), and adjacency.
 * Only blobs of 2 or 8 can be outers; inners are non-bg, non-outer blobs that are fully enclosed (do not touch bg) and adjacent to exactly one outer blob type (2 or 8), with no other adjacencies.
 * Objects are built by associating inners to their enclosing outer; outers that are used as inners elsewhere are skipped to avoid nesting beyond one level.
 * Placement groups objects by outer number (2 or 8); 8s are placed starting in column 0, 2s in column 12 (if original min_c <9) or 17 (if >=9), stacking vertically from top, sorting by (min_r, min_c).
 * Stacking rules: Objects are placed sequentially; if a new object touches (min_r == current_max_r +1) or overlaps vertically with the previous stack, shift right by 1 from current right edge (or restart stack if overflows cols=22); if touching and both have solid top/bottom (full row of outer_num across width), shift up by 1 row (shift_r=-1).
 * Filling rules: If placed top is not solid (not all outer_num across width), fill the row above with outer_num where bg remains; if touching without shift, fill horizontal gaps in the connection row with outer_num.
 * Subtleties: Adjacency checks use 4-directional (up/down/left/right); blobs must be exactly connected (same number); no diagonal counts; ensure no self-adjacency in get_adj_nums; handle empty groups gracefully; output initializes to full bg; placements clip to grid bounds; multiple stacks possible per group if overflow; original_min_c used for base column decision in 2s to distinguish left/right variants.
 * Easy to miss: Inners must not touch bg at all (even edges); only one outer adjacency allowed, and it must be 2 or 8; solid top/bottom checks are per-object width at exact rows; filling only applies to bg cells, not overwriting existing; sorting ensures top-to-bottom placement order; shift_r only -1 or 0 (no down shifts); cols=22 assumed from code.

**Previous attempts:**
 * This is the first detailed attempt shown; it successfully handled all three training examples (CORRECT), indicating solid extraction of blobs, inner-outer association, and basic stacking/placement logic works for simpler cases.
 * What worked: Atomic blob extraction via flood-fill correctly identifies connected components and bounding boxes; inner detection filters enclosed blobs with single 2/8 adjacency accurately; object building avoids multi-level nesting; group placement by outer_num with base columns (0 for 8, 12/17 for 2) and sorting by position ensures ordered stacking.
 * What didn't work: In complex stacking, the shift_r=-1 logic may over-apply or miss solid_bottom checks (all prior stack bottom must be solid outer_num across current min_col to right); gap filling in connection rows only triggers for shift_r=0 and touch, potentially leaving unfilled bg in overlaps or new stacks; fill-above only checks placed top solidity but may not propagate multiple rows if multi-object stack.
 * Subtle misses: original_min_c <9 for left 2s vs right assumes grid structure but may misplace if input has atypical positioning; no handling for objects with zero inners (but code includes them fine); potential overwrite issues if inners overlap outers post-shift (but flood-fill assumes disjoint); no validation that placed objects don't overlap unintendedly across groups (8 then 2 placement order matters).
 * extract_atomic_blobs, find_inners, and build_objects are essential and correct for object decomposition.
 * place_group has complex stacking (touch/overlap/new_stack) that works for trainings but may fail test if widths cause frequent overflows or if solid checks are too strict/loose.
 * No unhelpful functions noted; all provided are relevant, though touches_bg could be merged into get_adj_nums for efficiency (but not broken).

**Test output:**
 * The generated test output places 8-group objects stacked in left columns (0-4), with inners (4,1,7,3,6) preserved inside, and some bg (9) gaps filled partially; 2-group in right (12-17+), with multiple stacks (e.g., one at rows 2-5 cols 12-17, another lower at rows 13-20), and horizontal fills visible (e.g., row 3 cols 12-17 all 2 except inners).
 * It looks mostly correct based on rules: No overlaps between 8/2 groups; inners like 4 in top-left 8, 3 in mid 8, 6 in bottom 2; shifting evident (e.g., tight vertical packing in 8 stack rows 0-7); top fills applied where tops aren't solid (e.g., row 0 has partial 2s but seems filled); however, bottom rows (20-21) are all 9 except possible clip, and row 7 has full 8s across 0-4+8-10?, suggesting possible extra fill or base extension.
 * Differences from expected: Without input grid, hard to verify exact object positions/shifts, but output has unexpected 2s in row 0 cols 12-17 (may be a new stack or fill-over), and row 11 has 8s in cols 10-14 which might be spillover from 8-group or misplacement (code places 8 first, but if widths >4, could shift right); also, inner 7 in rows 9-11 cols 11-13 touches placed 8s correctly, but if input had different enclosure, this could mismatch; overall, it makes sense for stacking but may have unfilled gaps (e.g., row 6 cols 12-17 all 9, possibly intentional new stack start) or missed multi-row fills—note that it's different if expected has no spillover or tighter packing, but unknown without input.
 * The test output does make sense as a stacked reconstruction with fills, but potential issues in right-edge handling for wide 2s (e.g., if original_min_c >=9 triggers col 17, but widths cause col 21 overflow/clip).
